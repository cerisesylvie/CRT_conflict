47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,9265,"This motion has been on the agenda of the Regional Council for a long time now, but it is still relevant, indeed, most likely we could have added something else in the introduction, so it is a motion that once again wants to report and draw attention to the need for updates and clarity regarding the expansion of the Parini hospital complex, a project that - we said it in 2021, when we resigned for this very reason - is of fundamental importance for the Aosta Valley community, so let's go back to 2021, because it is useful to remember all the steps. English: We recall that in 2021, during the discussion of the petition of the Vallée Santé Committee, not our resolution was voted on, despite having been voted on in the Commission, after which the five colleagues who left our group decided to follow another path, a resolution was voted on that requested, urged the activation of a working table between the Institutions, therefore between the Region, the Municipality of Aosta and the designers, with the aim of verifying the technical, economic and temporal feasibility of the project, especially in light of the new challenges that emerged with the pandemic. This resolution, we recall, committed to proceed with the variant of the executive project of the east wing of the Hospital, to simultaneously continue the design phases of the renovation of the current Hospital and complete the definition and identification of the hospital services that would also be activated taking into account the pandemic, to start a discussion on the destination of the Beauregard Hospital and the former Maternity, to present the project to the Aosta Valley population through the most appropriate tools. Since then, a small room has appeared right next to the Hospital, an Info Point, right next to the construction site, which I believe does not find much participation, I often pass in front of the Hospital and I have never seen anyone inside that small room and above all, seeing the slides that pass, if we are interested in the archaeological excavations, what is inside that video is certainly of great interest, but, if we are interested instead in what concerns the Aosta Valley health system, we find very little. English: Many initiatives have been made mainly by our group and by the Rassemblement Valdôtain group to ask that, following that hearing on April 10, there be updates, this is because I went to watch that hearing again, to take back the various passages and, apart from the fact that the planners were not present, so this alone would have deserved a hearing, but on the other hand I also went to take that hearing and to check which documents then arrived precisely following that hearing and I can say that many of the questions we asked in that hearing have not found any answer to date: an example - naturally I take the passages referred to in my speech - I asked to have an analysis on the appropriateness of the operational beds and the consequences of the articulation of the hospital structures, this is because at a certain point, during the hearing, there was talk of double radiology, so one radiology in the old Parini, one in the expansion, it was not clear, also in light of the questions asked by councilor Manfrin, what was the fate, for example, the pharmacy, so on this point we absolutely had no answers. After that we also focused on the issue of limitations related to the helipad where we know well it will be placed above the hospital, but we know equally well, with limitations, to one flight per day with respect to the possibility of landing on that structure. Then there were also questions from councilor Lucianaz to which you had not been given an answer and which perhaps he will then present. I imagine that the Councilor will tell us: ""I have already come to the hearing on April 10"", if you think that the hearing of April 10... moreover there was also a speech by Councilor Marquis, who said: ""But holding a hearing without the plans, without having an awareness of what is being done makes little sense"", so, even from a planning point of view, very probably... but this is the Councilor's field and certainly not mine, so perhaps he will also be the one to explain the reasons with respect to those steps that had taken place on April 10 and which, in essence, gave space to new hearings, this is what we seemed to have understood, or in any case also to the sending of new documentation that we requested right there. English: We must also remember that, after that hearing on April 10, thanks to the various initiatives, we learned from Councilor Marzi, on February 9, 2024 we were told that the validation of the executive project was close to completion. On July 11, 2024, so a few months later - ""close"" is perhaps subjective depending on who is speaking -, again it was said: ""No, but it is a matter of very little"". From that February 9 to October 15, eight months have passed and from 2021 to today, more than three years have passed. Furthermore, as I remembered, during the discussion of that petition it was also said: ""No, but we must continue with the project, in the meantime with the design phases of phase 4 and 5, because in this way we have an idea of ​​the overall costs for the entire hospital facility"", because, in my opinion, it is good to remember that the expansion will only be for the acute hospital, so it is not everything we need. Nothing more has been said about the fate of the Beauregard, we have not had any updates on this either, and also about the fate of the former Maternity Hospital, all things put in that petition. With this motion we therefore ask the Health Councillor again to come to the V Commission, perhaps even with all the documentation, within 15 days - because it seems to us that, given that more than 8 months have passed, even if we put a rather short time, we can do it -, to come and present us with the verification of the technical-design and economic compatibility, as well as the feasibility in adequate chronological terms of the expansion project of the Parini Hospital. This is essentially what was envisaged in the resolution and naturally to also present all the design variations and the state of the art of the works in the various hospital facilities, because the only certainty we have is that the Aosta Valley will never have a single facility, this is the only thing that the Aosta Valley health workers were asking for and it is the only thing we know we will never have. We also saw the resolution of November 4 that tells us about 178 million and here too we repeat that it is only about the expansion and the projects, therefore not about everything that is needed, therefore it would also be interesting to understand what the total costs are, if we have an idea, what the expansion costs, the demolition of the superfetations, the entire renovation of the old Parini, the construction of the maternal and child center, the relocation of the Psychiatry and so on and so forth and also when they think of finishing all this, because one of the things we had highlighted and continue to say is that we absolutely needed the Hospital and it had to be decentralized, it had to be unique, it had to be ready soon. At the moment, however, we know very little. As I was saying, we certainly know that it will not be a unique facility, but we know nothing about everything else. Maybe the Councilor knows, maybe he can tell us today, but what we want is to go back to the hearing first to provide the documentation requested on April 10th that we are still waiting for, but then to ask questions, because it is enough to go and see that hearing to understand that, having no idea of ​​what was inside that Hospital, very few questions could be asked, therefore also have an idea of ​​the beds. English: I also read - however, since it was downloaded only today, I read the resolution quickly this morning - that in essence the Municipality of Aosta was raising problems with respect to traffic and on the other hand was asking that the planned parking spaces also be used for other needs, therefore not only for those going to the hospital, but for those who also want to visit the city of Aosta, therefore also understanding with respect not only to traffic, but to the spaces that we know have also been reduced where we are going and what the priorities will be that have been set in the project, because there was talk of two parking spaces for every bed, it is normal that, if anyone can park there, those two parking spaces will most likely no longer exist. These are all questions that cannot be narrowed down in a debate on a motion and that is why we ask, for the umpteenth time, to come to the Commission to present this project and the whole vision that this majority has with respect to this work, which, as I said, is extremely necessary and which is becoming, in our opinion, the biggest flop of this majority, but this is our vision. Let's see what the Councilor will answer us and then we will also evaluate the next steps."

47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,11015,"Bondzor a tcheutte. [Literal translation from the patois: Good morning everyone]. The requests of my colleague Guichardaz are sacrosanct, clarifications are being requested in the Committee. Unfortunately, this is a record that is heard too often on this subject, but with the permission of my Group Leader, taking the floor, I must nevertheless give a small explanation for what happened yesterday. Yesterday I did not respond to a colleague who called me ""that's disgusting, you should be ashamed"", etc., because I thought it was decidedly absurd, instead, seeing today the unleashing of press articles, at least to the Chamber and to those listening I owe two explanations, starting from the fact that yesterday I was commenting with a colleague of mine, certainly out loud, on the issue of the manner in which the floor was granted and I did not address absolutely any epithets to those who had the floor... but like this Padovani... (intervention by Councillor Padovani, off microphone) go ahead and be sarcastic, colleague, but I don't listen to the stupid things you say, so don't worry. For this fact I have been condemned by several press outlets, in particular the Aosta Valley agencies, sounding boards of the PD and, patience, it is not the first time that these press agencies report untrue facts, such as the constant reference to the ""great farce"" that I would have pronounced in 2022, I have never said a ""great farce"", however it continues to be reported with a quote. With my colleague, however, yesterday we cleared things up, I believe in a peaceful and reasonable way, I also told him that, if he feels offended, I apologize, I say it publicly, I was not addressing him, so I think for me that the matter can end here. If I then have to justify myself further, I have no problem supporting it. However, I believe that, chatting with a colleague, I can at least have the right to use the words I want. I repeat: with the colleague there was nothing and the epithet was not addressed to him, then everyone can consider the fact as they like. I will take the time to reread the article by Piero Minuzzo because it seems quite worrying to me. I am talking about the Hospital and I come to the motion because on December 4, 2023, in a hearing at the Municipality of Aosta, we heard several municipal councilors complain about the fact that the technicians do not give answers, they asked for certain times and precise data that were not provided on that occasion either, fortunately, the hearings of the Municipality of Aosta are public, so we can quote them, right, President? Another opposition councilor expressed in front of the engineer who was reporting: ""It is difficult to have a political debate without the presence of the other party, given that the technicians act on the mandate, I would have been very pleased to see regional politics here"", other interventions by the Renaissance group, etc., so even the Municipality of Aosta was not given the answers that are continued to be asked for in this Council. Let's move forward, in the sense that, remembering that the executive design of the Hospital of the new wing of the expansion was from 2013, I repeat: the executive design was then stopped in 2014 by the Regional Council, then the archaeological findings, etc. ... we have a statement from the engineer that the Hospital was expected to be delivered in December 2019, you all know this, even the newspapers know it. The fact is that they continue to ask for data that is not provided. This week we learn that the expansion of the Parini Hospital is planned for the modest sum of 178.5 million, so, in addition to documentation that we hope will be provided, otherwise we will try to get it in a different way, in addition to the 31-page report - and then I will take up some passages of this report -, we ask whether these 178.5 million euros are concentrated on the expansion, on the part of block K and Hospital Street alone, possibly, excavation work still to be scheduled for the archaeological aspect permitting and here I would like to know from the Councilor what he intends to do in that area that has not yet been excavated. We therefore normally ask, and we will also ask in the Commission, how much the total amount of the works for the entire Parini complex will be, including phases 4 and 5 of which we have absolutely no documentation. To return to Block K, I remember that in the Commission, that famous 10th April, several questions were asked, not all of which received an answer, I will summarize a few to refresh the Councilor's memory, that is, if on the top floor of Hospital Street, which houses a conference room, refreshment services and other things, if he means the floor below the connecting gallery between the two buildings and here no answer was given; where would the bus stop, if it narrows the roadway, indeed, the roadway will often, for the works, be narrowed to a single lane and they wondered where the bus stop was, where pedestrians crossed, if sidewalks were not planned, they are not indicated on the rendering, how will it be possible to cross Viale Ginevra at ground level and for how long will the use of the second lane of Viale Ginevra be planned. Here we did not receive any answers. Hospital Street already has separate routes in the pandemic perspective that was so much talked about during the Covid phase and the same thing for the Emergency Room, we did not get any guarantees during that hearing. You were still asking about vehicular access inside Parini, will it undergo changes during the construction of Hospital Street? We know, at least that's what the engineer told us, that Hospital Street will be built in three sections, moving the current entrance to the Hospital from time to time. It would be good to have some clearer ideas. What do we know about 118 and their headquarters which is currently located near the concierge? English: He still wondered, without receiving any answers, where the underground excavation will be carried out for the passage of the pipes, which will connect the technological center to block K, whether excavations are planned in that area for the discovery of the stone circle, as indicated by the International Scientific Commission, whether the construction of another archaeological area is planned in that area, to be clear, near the sampling center, in case, as seems evident, there is an archaeological discovery. No answer was given to this and I am talking about April, so more than six months have passed. He still wondered whether the hospital complex, depicted as designed to position itself at the top of the parameters of energy and environmental sustainability, I ask whether at the renovated Parini, therefore phases 4 and 5, a photovoltaic system is also planned there, very high-performance machines and systems, advanced sensor supervision systems, efficient envelope systems integrated with bioclimatic solutions, we have not received an answer to this as on phases 4 and 5 there is total darkness on the Government's decisions. English: Since we are talking about a new hospital, we would like to have answers on these sectors too, but they have never been provided. Then the trees, the green area around this hospital, but where do you plan it? The only green thing on the rendering is the roof of the buildings colored green, but I wonder: does this seem like a serious hospital to you? Again: from the images of the preliminary design of the old Mauriziano, that is, the building that should be renovated and made integral as it was originally... I remember that the Aosta hospital is a fascist work par excellence, in the images, those few and very rare images that we have seen, its original identity has not been provided, so will the Mauriziano be put back as it was originally or will there be superfluities? Also on this, Councilor, it would be the case, six months after that scanty 31-page report, even with several typos, as we pointed out during that hearing, that you provide us with some answers. I still have a few minutes and I'll take this opportunity to talk about the parking lots, which have been reduced by 50%, I repeat, the parking lots are, from what I understand, 4.20 meters, know that a Mercedes Compass is 4.95 meters long, a pickup 5.20 meters, I would like to see how we manage to park them in that underground parking lot and we still haven't figured out where we'll get all the other spaces. A parking lot was planned in the south-west area of ​​the current hospital, now the technology center will be built, I would really like to understand, and we've never been given an answer, where these spaces are planned to be built. I'll end with the construction site, there's little talk about the construction site and it will be the big problem if the work on this site ever starts. Here we have a series of regulations to comply with, the regulations on prevention, on compliance with safety, decree of 2008, the protection of hygiene on the construction site is fundamental and I am talking about law 300, we have the law that regulates quality public works: 109/1994, which requires control by the Administration at an inspection level, for evaluation of the projects by the contracting station. The combination of the two regulations cited requires a preventive check to prevent the company entrusted with the work from blocking the work, rightly claiming the impossibility of accessing construction site areas for supplies needed to carry out the work. The engineer told us that the area designated for parking will be used initially, but I would like to point out to you, Councillor, you should know, that there is a regulation that regulates accidents and hygiene of workers, which, to be in compliance, will have to provide the construction site with a series of prefabricated containers used as bathrooms, changing rooms, warehouses, offices, meeting room for the management of the work, canteen, which in total involves the occupation of a considerable part of the construction site area of ​​the parking that was indicated to us for the first phase of the work. Then there is the quality control during the work, where there is an obligation, in order not to be excluded from subsequent contracts, to comply with the control and differentiated storage of all the material used on the construction site. This therefore forces the company to prepare adequate areas separate from each other, where to store everything, that are perfectly indicated breakages and defects of the material, etc. There is internal circulation, interference areas, loading and unloading, an impressive thing in that hole. You want to continue to build it there, you are stubborn, it is your choice, the people of Aosta and all the people of the Aosta Valley will pay for this disservice, starting with the same bikes that cannot even be brought inside the Hospital, imagine the circulation, with trucks that have to unload, construction vehicles, material storage areas that you will have to identify in some area of ​​Aosta, etc. The criticality is enormous, at least come and report to the Commission as requested by this motion."

I don't see any other requests, I close the general discussion... No, still in general discussion. The general discussion is not closed. Councilor Marzi intervenes."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,6,7471,"Before making an analysis from genesis to apocalypse, reasoning about issues that are not the subject of the initiative, in my humble opinion, and that is why I intervene in the general discussion, it is important to give credit and respect to a motion, no. 19, which has premises and commitments. As you rightly recalled, colleague Guichardaz, it is not your fault if the motion arrives now, but it is not my fault either, so I respond today sic stantibus rebus. On Monday 4 November 2024, a date that has also brought peace in history, the Regional Council expressed a positive assessment of the variant of the executive project of the fourth lot, phase 3, of the new single regional hospital Umberto Parini. With the approval of the variant of the executive project we effectively completely close the third project phase that goes to create what in the imagination of every Val d'Aosta is in reality the new regional hospital. : The fourth lot of the third phase in fact includes the construction of bodies K, L and P, therefore respectively the helical cylinder - which I understand some people mock, but which is in fact the acute hospital, with the conservation and enhancement of archaeological finds -, Hospital Street, therefore body L, that is the new entrance to the new hospital which corresponds to the current Viale Ginevra and the extension of the underground car park, therefore body P. The approval of the variant of the executive project in the anticipated timeframe allows the issuing of the decree of the President of the Region as the building permit, which will then be followed by the start by SIV of the public tender procedure for the construction of the work for a total amount of charges and VAT of €178,515,453.96, of which €143,944,169.18 are for works and correspond, after 7-8 months, to the update of the amount of €178,515,453.96. 139,663,000, reported during the Commission last April and included in the documentation on which we actually worked hard; then I understand that someone might think that it is a level written at random, but it was not. English: The variant to the preliminary definitive design, coming to the story, which you rightly start from the spring of 2021 when a resolution was voted in this Council and, among other things, was also voted by many colleagues who are not part of this majority today, but who at the time both the majority and the minority believed and gave rise to a series of absolutely coherent actions on this issue... The variant to the preliminary definitive design to the executive design was prepared during 2023, while the variant to the executive design - and this, colleague Guichardaz, I have already told you in response to an initiative by colleague Lucianaz a short time ago - was validated by the RUP on 8 July 2024, after what you rightly recalled had been concluded, that is, the verification report by the verifiers that had arrived on 5 July 2024. Consequently, the variant to the executive design of the fourth lot of phase 3 of the new SIV was approved by the sole shareholder meeting on 15 October last. Parini Hospital. The variation to the executive project therefore confirms the coherence with respect to what was declared during the hearing in the V Council Commission of 10 April 2024, during which the main functional and performance characteristics of the building complex were illustrated, therefore the fourth lot as regards phase 3, therefore the bodies K, P and L, the construction site aspects, the summary timetable of the main milestones of the intervention, which then, as just mentioned, and I wanted to do it on purpose, have undergone some variations, but in fact we are now talking about something that was concluded on 4 November, the costs of the intervention and the timetable in progress. We are therefore closing the phase 3 process in accordance with both the Council resolution of 12 May 2021 that you referred to, which committed to proceeding with the variant of the executive project to adapt it to the protection and enhancement of archaeological finds through SIV, and with respect to what has been reported several times in this chamber regarding the theme of the new Hospital. We have therefore declined what was foreseen in the Council resolution 1180/2021, proceeding with the preparation of the variant of the definitive and executive project of the phase 3 intervention. Once the new Hospital for acute patients has been built, the activities and functions carried out in the current Parini can be transferred, thus freeing up the current Hospital and allowing the renovations of the subsequent phases to begin. It is quite clear how the new Hospital plays a central role in the overall reorganization of healthcare, as foreseen in the regional DEFR programming, in the health and social welfare plan, in resolution 1609/2022 concerning the new territorial programming and in the new company act. I understand that in the game of parts, politics says that we move randomly, without a compass, but in reality these are actions, politics and the Administration reason in actions, these actions are consequential to each other and are fully consistent with each other. All these actions will therefore progressively reorganize healthcare, the networks of social-health, social-assistance and social services, making the models for taking charge of the health and social welfare needs of citizens and our Aosta Valley community more effective. English: As of today and until the publication of the relevant tender notice, as required by the procurement code, it is not possible to disclose further material as these are confidential documents that will form an integral part of the tender documents for the works, as we have also declared, therefore the project is the one presented in the aforementioned session of the V Commission. This aspect is not a secondary aspect, which, among other things, has very important technical connotations and which, in fact, also means that some of the things that were requested could not be given. This motion, for which we therefore ask for withdrawal otherwise we will abstain, has never been votable before, but even less so today. In fact, ideological positions may remain different, different from a political and administrative point of view: this council, however, has collected a vital practice for our community and for the part of our competence we have all abhorred the inertia that brought the closure of phase 3 home in three and a half years. We are not finished yet, there will be a competition, a construction site, the next phases to analyze and conclude, but to date we have behaved with common sense, seriousness, working hard and seriously, so ad maiora and certainly up with hearts. The point of contention is that all the things that have been said in the presentation of this motion are part of a recent past: from today there is a future for which this majority hopes that everything will go in the best possible way in a world that changes, full of risks and pitfalls. Those who still want to talk about things must realize that with November 4th we have moved on to another era and another phase."

I reiterate and repeat: that will be the acute hospital, it is not the hospital that the Aosta Valley community needs, which is also made up of all the other parts, because honestly, unless we think that from now on only acute patients exist, everything else must be there, unless we delegate to private clinics, I think you saw, for example, a broadcast a few days ago on La7 that was very worrying also with respect to this topic, but we will certainly talk about it in the next Councils, but, from this point of view, I ask you if, in your opinion, what you told us today is an answer, because I did not understand the chronological terms, for example, with respect to this project, after your answer, that is, did you give us times? Did you tell us: ""The Aosta Valley community will have the acute part in 2030""? And I repeat: the acute part, not the Hospital, I don't think you told us and, when we have the maternal and child unit placed there, when we have the psychiatry, what will happen to those parking lots? You have absolutely not given an answer to all this and I repeat: none of us is asking to have projects or things to disclose externally, but we ask for clarity, because you know better than me that having a radiology or two radiology units certainly has an impact not only with regard to the operators who you tell us every day that they are not available, this thing is said every time, so we even double the radiology units, then, by doubling the radiology units, we will also need, I imagine, machinery on both sides, which does not seem to me to be even of little importance compared to the costs that we have to imagine. Reading that resolution - but, as I say, I did not read it carefully because it was downloaded only today -, the same general director, Dr. Uberti, clarifies at the same time his primary interest in the solution of the residual interferences that may arise between the Viale Ginevra construction site and to the west of it with respect to the operation of the current hospital. He briefly illustrates the contents of a technical examination report that contains several points that, in his opinion, require further investigation: for example, very probably, in a hearing we will ask for it with access to the documents but having this report can certainly be of great interest, because Dr. Uberti's concerns are concerns that we have reported since day one and I am pleased that you continue to remember that the turning point came in 2021, because we, from this point of view, are absolutely convinced that the choice made in 2021 turns out to be the right one the further we go. Maybe in your reply you could also announce to the people of the Aosta Valley when the piece of the acute hospital is planned, in the motion it was also mentioned to have knowledge of the chronological terms not only of the money, so we know, and we have read it everywhere, that we are talking about 178 million for that piece, now we ask you: then tell us also the chronological terms in which this piece will be done and I repeat: a piece, because then everything else is missing. I thank you, of course we are maintaining the motion and we will listen carefully to the other colleagues as well."

47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Barmasse,Roberto Alessandro,1959.0,M,UV,10,4841,"I am speaking from a technical-administrative procedural point of view, obviously the Councilor has already expressed himself. I am only expressing my opinion, now Councilor Guichardaz at the beginning of her first speech always spoke by saying: ""But we will not have a single facility"". I think that the facility will be single, because there will be the Acute Hospital and the part that remains in phases 4 and 5 will be the Maternal and Child Department and Psychiatry. Once the project is completed in its entirety and complexity, we will have a single facility. This is obviously a good thing, but the other statement you made, Councilor, is: ""All health workers are asking for a single facility"", I worked for many years in the Hospital and no one has ever asked me for anything. Maybe Covid has taught us something, in the sense that centering all the services in a single place - I repeat that I am expressing a personal opinion - can sometimes create problems and maybe we should have learned something from Covid. There was also talk of a double radiology, I think that a double radiology - I don't know if it is still planned - but it would certainly be very useful because we could separate the services for in-patients and the services for out-patients, this could certainly bring advantages from the point of view of not having two paths cross that could create problems for patients. Which does not necessarily mean having the same machines in two radiology services with very high costs, but perhaps services and equipment that are a little more basic using the staff based on needs. The Hospital for acute cases for me is the Hospital, because in the future... but already now we should not plan for hospitals where patients remain hospitalized for months, so much so that the Hospital for acute cases, which I would not even call it for acute cases anymore, but I would say the Hospital, is related - and this is also taken up in the plan for health and social well-being - to all the health services in the area. When the whole system is up and running, the acute hospital will be a hospital where people will have to stay for as little time as possible, because we know very well that there are a whole series of hospitalization pathologies for which patients who do not require an intensive service should not be in a hospital structure, but should be in intermediate care structures and perhaps these structures should be in the territory for the discussion I was having before decentralizing the services. On the issue of having a hospital in the city, I think that each of us has his or her own opinions and they are all right and correct, there is no scientific publication in the world that says where a hospital should be built, whether it should be built inside a city or outside, these are subjective choices in relation to the needs also linked to logistics, the conformation of the territory, the available spaces, the occupation of green areas, so the methods and problems are multiple. I think it is difficult to say: ""I am 100% right and someone else is wrong"". These were choices, as I said before, I know very well that you, Councilor Guichardaz, do not approve of them, you have said this several times, of course, but to say that someone is right and someone is wrong I think is very difficult. This Government has made a choice, it is carrying it forward, on one thing I completely agree with you, the hospital facility is an emergency and on this I would say that this is what the health personnel are asking of us, at least these are the questions I am asked, in the sense that people want the work to start on a Hospital because they can no longer stand seeing this eternal excavation in front of the Hospital that we have had there for I think 15 years now if not longer. Another little thing I wanted to say to Councilor Lucianaz, who I saw has already booked again, is that you have reported a whole series of data and I congratulate you because you complain about not having information, but you also manage to find out the size of the parking lots. Before criticizing the lack of storage facilities for materials or medicines, of having parking lots that are too small where we should see how we can park the cars, maybe first we acquire the information, then we will make the necessary criticisms. I think that the spaces also for further services in the old Parini structure are large spaces, where we can imagine a whole series of support services for the Aosta Valley health system and support for the Hospital, this is my idea, but I think that we should always speak perhaps with numbers and not only with suppositions. If you also managed to have the size of the parking lots, tell me how you did it, because I don't know."

In the meantime, there was someone who said a motion or an agenda is not denied to anyone, especially when it is referred to the Commission, because it is in the Commission that the real issues emerge, can be debated, can be explored in depth. Of course, perhaps the motion's demanding nature could be toned down, probably with a minimum of amendment one could say: ""Yes, okay, we will go to the Commission and do the in-depth analysis"", which inevitably everyone asks for, because I just read a Commission report yesterday when there was the SIV hearing and the contract was supposed to start in 2024, but in February, so there is evidently a delay and these delays will inevitably accumulate and will continue. Phase 3 has finally ended, here too with a significant delay, which is certainly attributable to what has been found, to the archaeological excavations, to everything that has occurred and we will have to start phases 4 and 5 which complete the entire context of the Hospital, from the acute hospital to the hospital where there is the Maternal and Child unit and where there will be Psychiatry. Here, however, we need to give times, we need to give answers, we have asked in the past as a political force and also as a united Centre-Right, we had strongly asked to understand the times and resources that were necessary to complete phases 4 and 5 as well. The 175 million are needed to complete the first three phases, but we also need to understand the continuation, what it will be, what it will include, etc. Another reflection on the issue of the single facility: yes, they asked for it in the Commission, the medical unions asked for it here, they came here to say: ""We want the single facility"". I remember that when I was a Councillor and I tried to move the clinics away from the Hospital, there was a popular uprising among doctors: ""No, everything must be concentrated there"". So that's how things are. I believe that a minimum of amendment on this verification of technical-design compatibility, which no longer has any reason to exist in our opinion, but there is a need to have a general picture of the investments that will be necessary to reach the conclusion... colleagues, please..."

The way you are dealing with this topic is worrying, goodness you, we will talk about it in the coming months, especially the many Aosta Valley residents who will be called to vote soon, including those of Aosta, Municipality, will talk about it, and this will become a topic of sure public interest, as it has always been, but I would never have imagined such draconian responses from you. Goodness you, keep it up. There are delays, I repeat, the executive project was from 2013 and engineer Felli had planned to deliver the Hospital by 2019. This is the story and look at where we are. We will continue with this eternal construction site, with the poor services that many Aosta Valley residents know and especially those who work there. To colleague Barmasse I say: yes, the data, unfortunately I did not hear a single piece of data in the Councilor's response. I asked 27 questions, I also asked what the 178 million were referring to, you rightly gloss over it, keep going, it's your style, you don't give answers, not only to the opposition, you don't give answers to the Val d'Aosta community. It's your way of behaving, you spoke for over ten minutes without giving a single answer to all the questions we asked you today. On the fact that there are large spaces in the old Parini structure, I ask my colleague Barmasse to accompany me, let's go and visit to understand what the large spaces are inside the Parini, I only see that there are some very serious critical issues. You don't want to talk about it anymore, November 4th seems to be this definitive date, a crucial date, for you it will be an important date, it will be the beginning of many big worries for the regional administration I fear. You haven't given us answers, you don't give us satisfaction, you don't want us to talk about it, you talk about it to the newspapers and then we will have to do the job that an opposition councilor does. It's a really unedifying way of dealing with the problem."

What I ask is to have answers and to have them in the Commission, where we can discuss. The same intervention by former councilor Barmasse allows me to raise some of the critical issues that I already highlighted in the introduction, the fact that not even those in the majority know how it will be structured, that is, the fact of having two radiology departments or having one, in any case affects the organizational model. We have just approved, and Councilor Marzi said so, a company act, it is normal - but we were also told in the Commission - that also with respect to what the structure will be, what the human resources will have to be, what the choice of machinery will have to be... they will certainly be choices that in some way... and we know this well because any building is designed and thought out also with respect to the organizational model that we want and with respect to the services that we want to provide, so in some way the fact that at this moment we do not know how many beds there are in the acute care hospital... then I agree, of course long-term care is a problem, but you also know the data of the Aosta Valley health system, and you know very well how long patients are stuck inside that hospital. We cannot say: the moment we build the acute care hospital, this will no longer exist, because then honestly do it as soon as possible, because it means that long-term care will no longer exist, it cannot be this even from this point of view. And also with respect to the definition of spaces, there is ample literature that tells us how a modern hospital should be made, that it should be within areas that are in some way not frequented by traffic, but this is quite obvious, just pass by there at six in the evening and ask yourself the question of how the ambulances - but we see it every time we pass by - should get to that hospital. Also from this point of view, if we want to get informed, there is ample literature that also tells us where the hospitals should be placed. What also emerged from today's debate, and certainly the commitment has been overcome, but honestly we are maintaining it anyway, since it seems to me that the will is to absolutely not come to the Commission, whatever the commitment is, there is no such will... the questions we ask here, what Dr. Uberti underlined in that report attached to the resolution are all questions that naturally should have an answer, at least within this chamber, at least we should be able to know what is happening. After that the choice is made, you carry it forward, because you are the majority and therefore you carry it forward, and I say this for this reason, but I think it was also seen, for example, on other projects, which he absolutely did not agree with, but, when the planning started, naturally it is not that one starts fighting battles or putting himself on the barricades, after which time will tell us if the choice was right or wrong. On this too, I will pass it on to you, Mr Barmasse, because you were rightly not in the Commission... but, when the doctors' representatives came, the only request was the single facility. This is the request they made to us, so this is what I feel like telling you because there is a document that has been filed with the Commission. Then you rightly say: ""When all the buildings are done, this will happen"", who knows, I believe that neither I nor my children will see that single garrison, but also on the timing we honestly have not yet understood even the timing of the expansion piece, let alone if we were to ask for the timing of everything else. From this point of view, I believe that even today's debate shows that in some way in the Commission we must confront each other, indeed!"

Well, naturally the same positions have always emerged, but there are some ideas and it is right that we take note of them and also express our conviction. We have always been convinced - and even more so today with the times that are getting longer and longer - of the fact that building a hospital there or, better, expanding it, making that place the fundamental center of Aosta Valley health is stupidity, it is madness. It was confirmed to us by some who design hospitals and then, with little satisfaction, I must say, because it is never satisfying to understand that those who govern you are doing stupid things, we also read it recently in an article in the local press, in the sense that there was a nice article about a gentleman who is an engineer and designs hospitals, who is from the Aosta Valley. Naturally, since nemo propheta in patria, as they say, he went to design abroad and then designed the City of Health in Piedmont. The journalist asks him: ""But how are modern hospitals built?"", ""Eh, modern hospitals are built where there is greenery, where there is space, where there is the possibility of making a modular hospital"", perfect, exactly the opposite of what we are doing. Beautiful, it was truly a great satisfaction, I say this with irony of course, because we really understood that what we were saying, simply using our common sense, was perfectly spot on. Building the hospital there, at the crossroads between the two main roads of the Aosta Valley, namely Mont Blanc and the Gran San Bernardo, is a gigantic stupidity, but by now you have decided, there was nothing to be done. Colleague Barmasse referred to Covid, which clearly did not teach us anything, because that was the project and that remained despite Covid and you instead had the possibility of making a different choice using the motivation of Covid and you did not do it, so it is clear that the will is that, who knows why I have an idea of ​​​​my own, but I do not express it here, which however has nothing to do with functionality, with utility, with the real reasons why we should plan the health of the Aosta Valley in the future. I also hear talk of two radiology departments, instead of one, thank you again that we can keep one open at this time and I don't know for how long, so let's really say that everything that has been said and reiterated clearly does nothing but confirm the two sides, but here on health we shouldn't make issues of political colors, we should really only make issues of common sense and think that the health of the people of the Aosta Valley is the priority, together, in my opinion, based on my beliefs, with education, but you really have made the wrong choice. I therefore believe that even, let's say, the assessor incitements are out of place, those ad maiora, etc. I actually respond with another way of saying that the Latins had: che mala tempora currunt and then very often we forget the other piece, sed peiora parantur. These are bad times, but, if we continue to govern like this, worse ones are being prepared."

This 31-page document - of course, Mr Baccega, I am not saying this to you, I am saying it for the sake of the discussion - analyzed in a timely and precise manner, as far as we are concerned and also as far as the SIV, the Department and the USL Company are concerned, the phase inherent precisely to the object of the resolution of Monday 4 April, so, regarding the fact that the Government absolutely shared the choices - and did so in an absolutely preventive manner, another aspect that, in my opinion, is important to recall -, certainly in the course of the coming year there will be a whole series of aspects on which we will find ourselves having to confront ourselves also on this very important step that ended on 4 November 2024 and which will now require that the President of the Region decree and that then, with the beginning of 2025, we go to tender. The bone of contention is linked to only one aspect, on which however, during the various debates and the various questions that have arrived on the executive of the new Hospital, there is a flaw, namely the fact that from April 10th we then had the control of the external verifiers on July 5th 2024, a date recalled in my speech during today's general discussion, but also recalled during some of the initiatives that have arrived since then and then it was validated by the RUP on July 8th 2024. This postponement from April 10th to July 2024, which then led SIV to approve in the Board of Directors on October 15th, and then us to go to the Council on November 4th, is the only thing that shifts from a temporal point of view the documentation that was distributed to all the fellow Councilors in April of this year. In my previous report, and I say this again for my colleague Lucianaz, the cost of the works, net of VAT and charges, was also highlighted, which in this presentation was almost 140 million euros. The fact that it then went to 143 with VAT and charges means that we arrive at the 178 million of the resolution of 4 November 2024. In fact, everything that this initiative, which is absolutely out of time - and, I repeat, not through the fault of the presenter, nor through the fault of the undersigned -, to all intents and purposes, envisaged in its commitment is not only now late with respect to the fact that the Council has already approved the variant of the executive design precisely in the Council, but also with respect to the fact that the entire part that is being asked to be shared had already been shared in a preventive phase that at this point is about seven months before the executive design variant that is the subject of this motion went to the Council."

I remember that, when I saw the first project proposal, I was in the City Council in Aosta, it had arrived there with a huge papyrus and there was already that will to go in that direction. I hope I don't have the tone of a mayor that you sometimes have, but I know you, so I know that you are like that, those who don't know you well can also get annoyed in some way. What I want to say is that we had a report in the Commission by Dr. Galotto, who explained a whole series of paths quite clearly, I must say, and those paths need to be explored again in our opinion, because Dr. Galotto has now retired, I believe, and has been given a specific assignment in the logic of following the work and the path to building the acute care hospital, and also phases 4 and 5, I believe, I don't remember exactly the resolution that was adopted. So there is a need to have a discussion in the Commission, where it is easier to work, it is easier to go into more detail, it is also easier to ask questions that can also be technical for those who are not technical in that sector. We will therefore certainly vote for the measure because we believe that it is necessary, beyond this commitment that is a bit too complex, to go to the Commission and do a further study on the path that will lead to building the new Parini acute care hospital in Aosta."

On the other hand, however, the debate has highlighted - but the debate in the Commission on 10 April had already highlighted it - the need to meet in the Commission to discuss the things that we have partly discussed today, but which certainly absolutely must be explored in depth, therefore, from this point of view, this closure continues from not wanting to come to the Commission... you spoke about the 31-page document, I present 1: the one on the numbers of the hospital complex, there is a page to put this data. Yes, of course, it is a page, and we have been told several times in the Commission: ""No, but that..."", ""The beds... Ah, but you can find it in that little diagram"". Yes, we are told how many beds there are, we are not told in relation to the analysis done, we are not told anything, but that's absolutely fine. ""If we don't want to explore the issues in depth, rightly so, we don't do it"". We have other tools, so don't worry, Councilor, that the questions we would have asked you in the Commission from now on we will ask you in interpellations upon interpellations, this is what we can do, so access to the documents and continuous interpellations to be able to better understand where you are going, because, I repeat, you are going there. I hope that you are not hitting a wall, not so much with regards to your choices, but precisely for the population of the Aosta Valley. Councillor, I really invite you to listen to what emerged in a short interview with a pensioner a few days ago on La7, because we will talk about that and it is certainly something that we have been denouncing for a long time within this Regional Council that worries us a lot, because then it is precisely the fragile people like that pensioner who have to turn to private healthcare and even negotiate the price of a simple operation, so very probably we will also return to this issue in the next Councils, because things of this kind did not happen in Valle d'Aosta and Valle d'Aosta was recognized, because, from the point of view of healthcare, in some way we had the same treatment both for those who were in one condition and for everyone else. Unfortunately what we are recording is no longer this and we are recording that for a long time there are precisely the most fragile people who have difficulty getting answers even with respect to treatments that are not of great importance, but which naturally also mean that the quality of a person's life can change."

I won't get into the discussion, maybe we did it three years ago by supporting the accompaniment of this path. I'll make it very short: I think that the final data of the discussion can be summarized in five very quick points. The fact that in a few months the expansion of the new hospital will be put out to tender, the fact that in a few weeks the President of the Region will approve the decree, will sign the decree... the day before yesterday the regional government positively evaluated the project and a few weeks ago the SIV Assembly passed in assembly what is the executive, colleague, and a few weeks ago the RUP validated everything. To return to the initial reasoning, the verification of the external subjects was done in July 2024 and the document that was illustrated to us for several hours in the Commission is practically the same that was approved by the Regional Council two days ago. This is to say that it seems to me that the Councilor has highlighted not only the path, but the mandatory technical steps that have been done in these 5-6 months and that the news today is that the Government has positively evaluated the project and that in the next few weeks there will be the decree to go to tender in the next few months. I think that we are not all technicians, we are not all engineers, we are not doctors, we have another role, I think that the synthesis of the debate... thanks again for giving us the opportunity to highlight what has been done in these six months."

The topic of the Hospital is a topic that I believe has been widely discussed both in this room and in the debate of our community. Here on my right we have the world champions of referendums and it seems to me that there was a consultation that had a very intense debate, very important and I believe that the answer was quite clear. The answer was given by the community that largely deserted a consultation, among other things, many of those who went to vote also in some way expressed an opinion contrary to the will of the proponents of the referendum. Now a whole series of initiatives, I say it, I don't know if I'm misinterpreting, but basically they are to delay and block the work, to then say: ""You see, we're not moving forward here"", that is, a whole series of initiatives are initiatives, in my opinion, specious: that's why I believe that the exhortation that comes from these benches to the Government is to proceed, it is to let the technicians speak, because here, I have to tell the truth, I'm also a little envious of some colleagues who seem to me to have skills that are above average, they are engineers, they are architects, they are safety experts, so it would seem that the designers, the technicians who have been identified are at the very least incautious, unreliable people, while here in the Regional Council we have excellent minds. So, since I try to stick to the things that a person of common sense highlights, I urge Councilor Marzi and the Government to proceed as they are doing, in a tight manner to be able to give a new Hospital to the Aosta Valley as soon as possible, because, if we listen to this No Committee, we continue to have chimeras, because we don't know where the new Hospital wants to be built, we don't know with what money, we don't know anything, but they are phenomenal at saying no. So go ahead with common sense, with correctness and let's try to proceed with the work."

I make a small observation on the things I have heard, it was said that the population of the Aosta Valley expressed itself way back in 2007 or, better, that it did not express itself because it did not go to vote. I believe that all those who are here, perhaps the youngest not, but the others certainly yes, will remember that that was the referendum of the ""broken pencils"", I think you will remember it; it was done, by the main party that at that time was at a different level than the current ones in the Aosta Valley, a campaign was made precisely to ask people not to go to vote: pas de sens pas de vote. The people who went to the polls instead responded clearly, clearly, and here there are also people who sit on the Government bench and who had dedicated a lot of energy to that referendum, then in the meantime they changed their minds and that's another story, but I would like to point out that 17 years have passed since 2007 and in between there has been everything and more. The health situation has changed extremely, there are problems that are linked to a request for better health care, and they are not small things, there was a pandemic that should have required, should have provoked reflections, should have imposed to stop for a moment and make comparative evaluations, because, if you remember well, when we chose not to follow the path of the Parini Hospital to be redone, to be expanded, we asked... but really every now and then I wonder if it is easy to forget things here, it is convenient, or if there is a deficit of collective memory...! because we asked for a comparison to be made to understand which choice, given that from then until 2021 everything has happened, that comparison that could have told us: ""It is better to use the money in that way, it is better to build a hospital outside, it is better to leave it there"", that comparison was not wanted to be made, it was not wanted! Because we did not say, when we voted against that famous resolution that led to the resignation of both - because it was logical that, if you did not support something like that, you were outside a majority, it seems obvious to me... - we did not say: ""No, let's build the new hospital"". No, gentlemen, we did not say that, we said something else, and it is not a waste of time to delve into it, especially after everything that has happened. Please, then, let's leave the 2007 referendum alone, because you know very well who was responsible for the failure of that referendum and I believe that, if 17 years later something like this had been done again, we would perhaps have had some surprises, because in the meantime people have perhaps also matured and what happened has left in all the people - and they are all those who need health interventions - ideas that are perhaps different from those that existed before. You did not want to do the comparative study, you decided to move forward, this is the way, but, please, you cannot come and say that asking to do an in-depth study, a hearing with all the documentation that is requested in the special Commission of this Council is a way to slow down operations. But what slow down? They ask to see what is there, they ask to take stock, but are we joking? What do they want to slow down? You ask to see, then we know that the positions are different, ours - and I am talking about our positions, mine and that of my colleague Guichardaz - have been very clear from the beginning, we have not prevaricate and we have not voted first one way and then the other. That was and that is, but allow us to ask to be able to see the documents."

Personally, as far as I am concerned, if there is a referendum, even if a person goes to vote, that is, he decides, rightly so, because he is the only one who takes on a civic duty and, if he votes like that, the others will have to suffer the decision. Let us remember, for the record, that about 30% voted in that referendum and of this 30% well above 60, I went to look it up: 63.56% had said they wanted the new hospital, so somewhere else, just to be fair. Having said that, things are done now, that's how it went, but I wanted to reply because the reply is always the same, it's time to put an end to this issue, because probably, but no one will have proof, if the people of the Aosta Valley had gone to vote, they would have asked for a new hospital, but oh well, if anything this shows that at the time at least, I hope less today, the party with the absolute majority at the time had a great ability to influence the electorate and good for them obviously.

Just last week, the dossier on immigration in Valle d'Aosta was presented, a document that highlights very significant data on the presence of migrants in our region and on their difficulties in accessing basic services. The dossier also underlines how essential it is to guarantee this effective integration and structured support to avoid marginalization and vulnerability among migrants. In light of this data, it is clear how important it is to reactivate the service that is the subject of this motion, because this helpdesk has the task of offering assistance and guidance to those who live in already precarious conditions, it becomes an indispensable tool to promote social cohesion and facilitate real inclusion. Even in the DEFR, the importance of inclusion was outlined among the strategic objectives and priorities of intervention of the majority, but let's go back to the path of this motion, which originated on November 2, 2023, then there was a new initiative in May 2024, precisely to understand from the Government what was happening with respect to this service and it was declared that 600 thousand euros had been allocated in the budget with a forecast of 200 thousand euros per year and that the service would be reactivated shortly thanks to regional resources to provide continuity. It appears to us that this continuity is not there, so in the motion we ask that the Councilor clarify a little the times and intentions with respect to the activation of this tender, assuming that perhaps we have not seen it and instead it has already been published. We ask the Councilor again for answers because that continuity, taking into account that the service has been interrupted since December 2023, I would say that there was no."

You asked if there was a will to reverse it, then you did not wait for the Chamber to respond but this to leave it on record. To meet the needs expressed by colleagues regarding timing, I will say a few brief things announcing that the Lega group will vote against this motion and will not vote against the issue of the hearing in the Commission, which, as we know, is the cigarette of a man condemned to death: you never refuse, you don't refuse anyone, so it is not a big commitment. What we are generally against is the principle and spirit that this service unfortunately has and it is something that we have reiterated on several occasions, because this service that we want to support and finance with lots of public money is a counter that offers services that in reality already exist and are available to everyone, that is, today the services that this counter provides, should provide today are already provided to all citizens of the Aosta Valley who go to any type of counter. Specifically, the ""Vivere Valle d'Aosta"" service offers the service of orientation and accompaniment to territorial services and support for social and housing inclusion. There are already social help desks, there are already a series of services that are evidently provided for all citizens and, precisely because there are a series of appeals and actions, I remember one above all the association financed by our friend Soros, the ASGI association, which obviously only deals with defending the rights of immigrants, at every turn, every time there is a public tender, a law or something, if there is something that even minimally excludes someone who has landed tomorrow and requests the same rights as someone who was born in this region or in his municipality and has lived here all his life, then ASGI intervenes to ask for equal rights, but the equal rights that are asked for on one side are not wanted to be obtained on the other, because here they want a specific help desk that only supports immigrants for accompaniment, territorial services and support for social housing inclusion. Not only that, counseling and guidance in the school environment, with support for enrollment, where necessary, training and work, support for filling out online forms for citizenship requests. I mean... but there are offices that already do it, if I go to the counter at the Municipality, if I go to the counter at the Police Headquarters, if I go to any type of counter that is available to everyone today, I find the same service. We sincerely do not understand why a service should be activated and financed specifically and exclusively only for immigrants. Obviously, with respect to this spirit, we sincerely do not find ourselves sharing the need to build, structure and implement this service, so evidently we will vote against it."

We are talking about structuring a desk with a dedicated office and broader functions than the ""Living in Valle d'Aosta"" desk, which only provided for a significant but discontinuous and lacking presence with respect to opening to the public. We are therefore working with a broader vision, aimed at characterizing the new immigration desk with a more solid structure and with more activities than in the past, in order to finally guarantee a continuous and qualified presence of the service in the area. In addition to the creation of this desk, among other things, the offices have worked on three FAMI projects - namely Fund, Asylum, Migration and Integration -, filed between the 23rd and 24th, which represent an added and specialized value in the commitment to improving access and the quality of services. The FAMI projects focus on three crucial areas: strengthening language teaching to facilitate linguistic integration, which is a project already underway; the development of an advanced data management system through a computerized database, which allows those who access the services to obtain personalized and targeted support, which is a project in the start-up phase and the strengthening of training courses and the recognition..."

The ambitious goal, to which all these interventions contribute, is to create an immigration desk that does not limit its functions to a mere point of assistance, but can represent a real model of inclusion and innovation capable of responding in a complete and professional manner to the needs of new arrivals and residents. To this end, the competent structure has been working since last March to identify a strategic and suitable space to be used for the desk. The goal is to find an adequate location that can meet the needs as a point of reference for citizens. In this sense, the offices are evaluating various options for spaces to be found both in the public and private sectors, but to date they are not easily viable. The offices are therefore continuing to explore other possible solutions, taking into account that the search for an adequate location for this purpose is not simple, as it is characterized by processes that require complex assessments and procedures that cannot be solved immediately. For this reason, given that the objective remains to continue working to find a solution that in 2025 will allow the opening of the counter by identifying the solution to completely outsource the service, it is a solution that ensures the location of the office since a future complete outsourcing means that the manager, in addition to taking on the service, simultaneously identifies the location of the same. The tender specifications, among other things, in this sense, are being finalized in order to start the service at the beginning of 2025. With the outsourcing of the service we have therefore imagined a new model that guarantees efficiency, accessibility and continuity, entrusting the management to a specialized economic operator. This choice will allow us to build a structured, welcoming and proactive service, capable of facing current challenges in a timely and professional manner, through a more agile and flexible service unlike the past in which limited resources reduced its effectiveness. The selected manager will also have the task of providing complete and personalized assistance to anyone who turns to the desk, therefore dealing not only with orienting new residents and migrants in bureaucratic matters, but also with promoting integration and knowledge of the territory, facilitating their inclusion in the Aosta Valley community. This means support in the search for housing, assistance in understanding and dealing with administrative practices, as well as job orientation by territorial, social and health services. Ultimately, this choice to outsource not only accelerates the opening of the service, but enhances its effectiveness, transforming ""Living in the Aosta Valley"" into the most functional immigration desk as a model that will bring tangible benefits to the entire community. What has just been expressed therefore makes it clear that the commitment of this motion is outdated in facts and concepts and, for this reason, we ask for its withdrawal or we will abstain."

I would like to point out that this morning, regarding the controversial issue of the hospital, Councilor Marzi had the opportunity to state that they, as a government, do not proceed randomly, as they say nowadays, a bit like that by trial and error, and that they are consistent in their actions. I fear, Councilor, today, that I will have to contradict you with documents in hand regarding this very topic, the management of the dog kennel and cat shelter; a question that we had already raised in unsuspecting times, because it was spring and we were asking for news, through an interpellation, of the Government's willingness to address the issue of the management of the dog kennel and cat shelter, knowing that at the end of this year the agreement in place with an animal rights association, the one currently in place, would expire. Well, the answer was not given to us by the Councilor, who unfortunately was not present at the time due to health problems, but by President Testolin, who told us that the offices were evaluating what to do. Then, in the summer, we understood what the result of this assessment of what to do was, because the Regional Council, with resolution 952 of 12 August 2024, which bears the title ""Approval of the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the Regional Administration for the three-year period 2024-2026, approved with DGR 276/2024, with the management service of the regional dog and cat shelter"", precisely, in fact acknowledged what the will was, what the technical-administrative, but also political, line was to follow. Then we had other initiatives, precisely after the summer, after this resolution of the Council, in which it was made clear to us that it had been decided to no longer entrust this service to animal rights associations, but to proceed with a tender, pursuant to the procurement code, and then this fact was further explained. Naturally this motion was launched and postponed several times, as we know, for various reasons, and then also in the DEFR it was made explicit by the Government, this desire to proceed not with direct assignment as had been done previously, but through a tender was made explicit. The response in this regard, which also came from the Assessor, was that ""it should be done this way"", ""it's better this way"", ""it's more transparent"", the concept of rotation etc., etc. In reality it is not like that at all. It is not like that, as we will try to demonstrate to you, with documents in hand, today. And a huge contradiction emerges in the actions of the current Government. So, the assignment of the management service of the regional dog and cat shelter is due to expire on 31 December of this year. There is a government press release announcing the intention to proceed with a tender pursuant to the public procurement code for the assignment of this service for the next three years, that is 2025-2027, and precisely, given resolution 952 that I just mentioned, with which we proceed with the integration of the purchase program of goods and services of the Regional Administration for the three-year period 2024-2026 with an allocation, allocating sums of one and a half million euros, therefore they are not even negligible sums, and considering that this motivation, this resolution, we had already raised this fact a bit like this, in the heat of the moment, at the time of the last intervention in... I think it was September, let's say that this resolution at a certain point like this, badly, as they say today, says: ""Considering that the competent offices of the prevention, public health, veterinary and food safety structure have assessed whether to proceed, for the next three years, with the assignment of the service in question pursuant to legislative decree 36/23, that is the procurement code; deemed - he continues - therefore necessary for the reasons given above... "". Here, there are no reasons, that is, having evaluated does not mean that it is a reason, this, in terms of administrative law, is a classic non-existent reason or, if we want, sometimes some judges call it apparent. There is a fake reason, because you cannot tell me that you evaluated and therefore you do this; you have to tell me what you evaluated and why you evaluated. But this becomes much more relevant if we put this resolution and another resolution of this same Government in the background, the one of December 6, 2021, where instead the agreement between the Region and the Association that currently manages it was approved; and here it is motivated, it is well motivated. Also because this resolution tells us many things: it tells us, first of all, for example, that the law clearly provides for it, but we recall it just for everyone's memory, that is, we recall ourselves, as they say, but also because I think that many of you will not have been very interested in this topic, but the management service, precisely, of kennels and catteries can be entrusted to zoophilic, animal rights and protectionist bodies and associations; moreover, we will see later, even the rules or circulars of the ministry, as a priority, say... there is the law, precisely the 281 that says it, then it says this, I am quoting precisely the passages of this resolution of this same Government of 2021: ""Considering that pursuant to article 24, paragraph four, of the regional law of 07/30/2010 - our law on pets - the activity carried out within the scope of the aforementioned agreements can only give rise to the reimbursement of expenses actually incurred for the non-health management of the kennel"", so for a non-health aspect only reimbursement of expenses eh, because there is a health part, a non-health part in the management of these organs, of these kennels and catteries. ""Considered therefore - he continues, cutting some parts - on the basis of these considerations, that the management of the kennel and cattery - attention, this is the key step, one of the key steps - by the Regional Administration should not be entrusted taking into account only the costs, but also the welfare of the animals, including not only their living conditions in the structures that host them, but all the various activities aimed at their entrustment and the relative control, as well as the dissemination of the culture of their respect"". Here, this is the fundamental aspect, because the laws that govern this matter, all the administrative provisions that govern these matters, are not based on a simple question of costs, of evaluations, as is done to sell goods or entrust services, it is not this; pets are something else, they are animals, in fact, and must be treated differently from any other product. And then this resolution says again, always a very interesting part: ""Recalling the circular of the Ministry of Health, dated May 14, 2005, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 - the national law on pets - which provides that agreements for the management of kennels and catteries must be granted as a priority to associations or entities with the purpose of protecting animals"". And then it continues, I'll explain it again, acknowledging another issue that is important for the purposes of our discussion, our treatment, that is, this resolution says again, something equally sacrosanct: ""Having taken note that, pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 7, of Regional Law 16/2005 - the one on voluntary associations etc. - voluntary organizations cannot participate in the public tender procedure relating to the awarding of public contracts for works, services or supplies"". Here, then, we close the circle: on the one hand, the rules on the matter tell us that when we deal with this matter, we must not only look at the appearance and the economic account and, therefore, things that can be clearly identified in a contract, it becomes difficult to identify in a contract how much you love animals, this is a bit difficult, I think, to be codified. So, here, putting all these pieces together, we arrive at the fact that we absolutely believe: that by choosing this path of making a tender, we evidently necessarily exclude the voluntary associations, which instead are those that have dealt with it up to now, and excellently I would say, also because (and here another contradiction arises) then that resolution, which we cited 2021, what does it still say about who is managing and is still managing today? In the spirit of giving continuity to the management, pursuing the priority objectives of protecting animal welfare and spreading the correct human-animal relationship, it signaled the need to review some points of the current convention. ""Considering that the Association Valdôtaine etc. etc. has managed the regional dog and cat shelter from 1989 to today, thus gaining considerable experience in this area; given that the competent public health and veterinary hygiene structure has analyzed the positive trend of the management of the regional dog and cat shelter entrusted to A.VA.P.A ONLUS etc., in the last two years of management from which the average number of animals hosted and the adoptions of the specimens returned to their owners are highlighted"". So this is the non-health part, and there is the whole table with the numbers: how many animals entered, how many animals were entrusted to, how many were placed, given up for adoption, etc., saying ""Ah, these did well, they are doing well"". Now we ask ourselves why the government has completely changed direction without saying why. This is where the critical issues arise, because if you don't tell me why two years ago everything was going very well, it was managed well, the service had to be based on issues that are not only economic, technical, etc., but precisely on those that are the correct principles, I would say, that are more than shareable, that is, those of treating animals well, of loving animals, of also doing additional and unpaid work, obviously, to try to place animals in need, puppies, etc., that need to find a family; now instead we move to a commercial criterion, we hold a tender and why do we hold a tender? Do you think there is some company, some LLC? or some cooperative, perhaps, that can do better? Not volunteers though, eh, people who do it to earn money, more or less, or maybe even to underpay those who then make you work. This is a problem, so something is not working. There are various problems in this decision, there are technical-administrative, legal problems, because we have seen that, by doing so, we go against principles that are in any case established by the law, that of entrusting priority to animal rights associations and, moreover, I open a parenthesis, it was also confirmed to us by the Councilor in his last speech in September, who told us that before there was only one, that one, now there are three; three are better, there is more competition, there will be the possibility of choosing who to entrust it to, right? Indeed... if by chance they all three say we are not in agreement, then another path will have to be chosen, but in reality the law in this regard also says that the management of dog and cat shelters should be direct, that is, done by the Municipalities; here we do it at the regional level, but by the Municipalities, therefore by the public body and alternatively, instead, therefore in second place, entrust to other subjects, primarily to voluntary associations. Here instead we are at the third solution: we make a tender as if it were any service, as if it were building a dog house, it is not this... the kennel and cattery are not that, it is something else much more important and much fuller. So this is the technical-legal aspect, then there is the one of merit: precisely, we have seen and I have listed for you now what the contradiction is, on the one hand in saying two years ago it is fine, it is fine managed like this, there is the health part, but there is the non-health part that is excluded and which among other things provides for the reimbursement only of costs and, now, without telling me why, it changes, the path is changed completely, that's it. And then there is clearly a political evaluation. Because this choice is clearly a political choice, one of two things, I think about this political topic: either, dear Councillor, you are letting someone else carry you - it is inevitable to think this, given that you have not given a reason - or, I don't know, someone has already thought of some cooperative; I don't know this, but you understand that it makes you think badly when there are so many elements put together. Many clues make a proof and therefore this scares me a lot. We therefore believe that, despite what you have said and written, despite what you have also established in the DEFR, perhaps it would be very appropriate to reflect again on this decision - which seems completely inappropriate to me - to proceed with a tender instead of referring, as always, to those who have done well; I am not saying that they are those who are already there now, anyone else, but an association of animal rights activists who do it with a vision, with purposes other than purely profit. So, the motion (I read the commitment, naturally reserving the right to intervene later): ""the Regional Council commits the Regional Government to revoke, even in self-regulation, the decision to proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023 to reach the identification - I say in self-regulation because in my opinion this choice is also illegitimate from an administrative point of view anyway - to reach the identification of the entity to which to entrust the management of the regional dog and cat shelter, excluding volunteer organizations from the possibility of becoming the trustees of such management; proceed to the identification of the entity to which to entrust the management of the regional dog and cat shelter, in compliance with the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Minister of Health dated 4 May 2000, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 and only secondarily, in the absence of interested volunteer associations, proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023"". Of course, it is evident, if you do not want to do it directly, if those questioned first say ""we are not interested"", then you should act directly, if you do not want to do it directly, you should then resort to outsourcing; but that should be, as I said before, the last residual choice: volunteers first."

47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6944,"Dear colleague Sammaritani, colleague Councilor, not a lawyer, because I cannot be a lawyer, I do not have the qualifications, the skills, the competences; however, as you often point out, here we are doing politics, so I am absolutely certain that, beyond the disquisitions in the style of foil, sabre, fencing, punches, you decide, on the current rules we are absolutely certain that both you and the Chamber cannot but share the ever-appropriate orientation that identifies in an open tender the most suitable administrative path to guarantee the continuity of the continuation of the service. It is mandatory to abstain from this initiative, especially because, as already highlighted, with respect to a situation that currently sees at least three animal rights associations in the regional territory, and no longer a single association, as recalled in the 2021 resolution that you recall, and therefore one must consider, in addition to the fact that there are three animal rights associations, also the significant economic amount of remuneration for the service, equal to 1.5 million euros over the three-year period, i.e. 500,000 euros per year, a figure that is well above the thresholds for direct assignment of services currently set at 140,000 euros, but you know this better than I do. However, it is not clear why and how the rumor spread that voluntary associations cannot participate in the tender, as recalled; in reality, they can participate indeed, as provided for by article 100 of decree 36 of 2023, which provides this possibility to subjects who have already had experiences, with a positive outcome, with public or private subjects, such as voluntary associations. We therefore confirm what has already been reported on the intention of this Administration to announce a European tender, with an open procedure with a single lot for the assignment of the management of the regional dog and cat shelter; also because this is the only viable path for an Administration that wants to survive and do the right thing for the community on this issue. The procedure will therefore be carried out by virtue of the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, naturally pursuant to the contract code, therefore evaluated on the basis of the best quality/price ratio, compared to the proposed cost for the management of the service, which will certainly take into consideration the proven previous experience in the management of public dog and cat shelters. In open procedures, voluntary associations are also considered economic operators, authorised by the law to provide services and carry out economic activities; therefore, they are part of the list of subjects to which public contracts can be awarded, as provided for in European law. In line with the aim of guaranteeing the highest quality of service, the Regional Administration will not proceed with the award if no offer is found to be convenient or suitable with respect to the service object of the contract, in the full interest of the well-being of the dogs and cats hosted within the regional kennel and cattery. It should also be specified that the tender notice will certainly respect the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Ministry of Health that you referred to; this criterion, if the management is entrusted to a subject other than an animal rights association that is not able to guarantee the animals with its own internal resources an adequate physical activity and socialization, as provided for by the regulations in force, establishes, in the principle of guarantee, the entry into the kennels to animal rights associations. This comparison perhaps also allows us to clarify that the European regulation surpasses the national law, allowing everyone to participate in public tenders; it therefore also surpasses regional law 16 of 2005 (regulation of volunteering and associations for social promotion) which, in article 8, provides that organizations cannot participate in public tender procedures relating to the awarding of public contracts for works, services and supplies. National legislation, especially European procurement legislation, has in fact legislated differently; it is possible that the associations involved have taken this regional law as their only reference, thus feeling excluded, but this is not the case and has never been the case. What has always been the case, however, is to distinguish the role of manager of a public space and public money from the role of volunteer organization, for the protection of the service provided, of the animals involved and also of the animal rights organizations involved. English: Colleague Sammaritani, of course I also said that we will ask to withdraw the initiative otherwise we will abstain; in my opinion it is absolutely important to make a distinction on this issue, because, in addition to aspects of an administrative nature, which are used to deal with the issue, behind all this there are more than legitimate but purely political motivations; those who are involved pro tempore in the management of this department, but also in the task of having to interact with the subjects who manage it, are perfectly aware that behind this world there is a world that, so to speak, moves, shouts, seeks contacts, confirmations, which at this moment should be absolutely serene. So we, as a Government, not only represent the fact that the choice that was made with the acts is correct, it is a transparent choice and it is the only possible one, because you understand well that there are absolutely legitimate motivations that led to the then act of 2021. Motivations that were fundamentally based on the presence in this region of a single voluntary association: a more than legitimate choice; as of today, this is no longer allowed. A figure of this kind, by the way, there is no need for a poor, chubby, bald idiot like me to come and represent it to a lawyer; it is also linked afterwards to the figure that in effect, how can I say, someone... can I do auto body shaming? I heard, it is called autoironia in Italian. However, objectively speaking, this thing here also allows for an intervention on the figure, because the figure is an important thing, in addition to the presence of several animal rights associations. The fact then, after it was decided with a resolution to give a mandate to the single procurement center to include the completion of this tender within the services was also represented by the CUC as the absolutely most normal way. As already represented by a colleague of its group yesterday, it is not the need of this Government to give indications beyond its own autonomy and the autonomy of others, and therefore, consequently, it is not even the need of this Government to ensure that someone harms ours."

Returning to the subject, I must say that there are some gaps in the reasoning that you, or whoever represents you, have made, because in fact we have never been told what should have been the assumption. That is, we are told: this is the right path, we are not told why the other one is wrong, the one you pursued until two years ago is wrong and that it should no longer be pursued, because in fact it is still pursued, so it is an essentially political choice, evidently. This, well, is fine, you are in the Government, you can do what you think in this respect, but the contradictory nature of the arguments - or rather, of the arguments on one side and nothing on the other - that emerges right ictu oculi , that is, immediately. There is a discussion over there: we do it this way because there are these constraints, there is the possibility of directly entrusting, there are these possibilities, they did well... then, as I say, I have nothing to do with this association and it is not said that it should be her, but I am talking about associations in general because they are governed by principles other than those of commerce or purely economic ones. All these motivations on one side and on the other nothing. So, in weighing all the motivations and nothing, you understand that it is strange to understand why and how to accept this obvious contradiction. This is the real issue. The figure is important now, it was also before, because it is not that we are deviating from that, a little something more in this commitment of these sums (we said 500 thousand per year), but even before we were more or less there, therefore over 400 thousand, so that is not even the motivation. The problem is that you are trying to support, with non-existent motivations, a purely political choice. So let it be said, let it be said that the volunteer associations... that we hope will go and do what they have to do, because that's the problem: you're getting into trouble, because now you're going to give it to a company or a cooperative that does things because it has a certain return, because that's the most economically advantageous offer, and then you hope, as is already written in the regulations, that the volunteers will go and do the part that they were already doing now, because they managed everything, and they will go and do it for free, etc. Who knows if they'll go and do it? And if they don't go and do it? I mean, these cooperatives or this LLC (let's call it LLC), that goes there because it's paid to do certain things, do you think they'd work day and night to find a home for a cat? When would that ever happen? Where do you live? What did you see? That's the issue, so you're getting into trouble for yourselves. A sector that is already delicate, a kennel and cattery that already as structures is not worthy of a reality like ours, which however, all in all, is limited and should have much more decent spaces for these poor animals and much more suitable, because I don't know who went to see, but I would invite you all to go and take a look at where they are kept, with much love I must say from those who work there, but certainly with not as many tools from the public administration. I repeat, the concept here is that you should not go and look at the tenders, you should not make these purely economic considerations: animals are not a product, I already said, they are not a service, they are much more. Their management requires an aspect that cannot be quantified, cannot be put in a table, cannot be reduced to a tender where it says ""You have to do this, this and this and everything you do is worth so much and I'll give you so much"" because it is not like that, that's why the rules are oriented that way. There must be a reason: either the legislator is someone who doesn't think or he made them for a reason and that is the reason. Therefore, to conclude, without getting too sentimental, but these topics interest me because I care about animals and therefore it bothers me when someone bureaucratizes this sector too and it shouldn't be like that, healthcare shouldn't have been like that, let alone animals who can't even defend themselves. Gandhi said it, that the civilization of a people is measured by the way they treat animals. Well, if that's the case, you're probably not very civilized."

Today, this is not the case. I, among other things, have pointed this out on purpose, because you are a fine listener, as well as a technician and a professional, in all the answers I have given; I pointed it out directly because I was absolutely certain that you had grasped this aspect, I am absolutely certain that you also grasped it when reading the 2021 resolution, just as we grasped it at the time and have grasped it in the continuation. I would also like to add that, quite legitimately, we not only care about the well-being of animals, including dogs and cats, especially dogs sheltered in the regional kennel and cat shelter, because as you know, cats are in all respects the Mayor's property: we had a meeting dedicated to this at CELVA on which we renewed the documentation on the CELVA website itself and we had a moment of strong sharing with the offices regarding the future and present of free cats that are, in fact, municipal property, so it is also useful that in this sense it can be correctly represented that sheltering poor cats in kennels is not permitted by law for the well-being of the animals themselves. We care about both dogs and cats, and in this sense the sensitivity that you are referring to is absolutely married. I would add, however, that it might seem like a paradox, not only political but above all administrative, the fact that in a tender with several subjects, who could win it for figures in the amount of 500 thousand euros per year, a Government or any administrator is being asked not to call for a public tender, but I know that this is absolutely not your intention."

Regarding the presence of more than one association, I believe that this can only enrich the panorama, in the sense that it is true that an administrator says: sure, I only have one, so I wash my hands of it, I give it to that one (if it wants it) and that's it, but that's not the problem. I think that outside the Aosta Valley, where I have to imagine that there has never been a single volunteer association, the dog shelters and cat shelters in other places are also managed by volunteers, so much so that there is an appeal to the TAR, of which I had read a sentence some time ago, where this was precisely what was discussed: an association that had challenged because the body, the Municipality in this case, since it was municipal, had decided to put together various Municipalities, to form a consortium with other Municipalities, and manage it directly. There the association said: ""Oh no, you have to give it to us because it says 'as a priority'"". It was not correct, evidently, so much so that the TAR rejected that appeal, but it makes us understand that there are volunteer associations outside too, they manage dog shelters and cat shelters and clearly there is not just one for each metropolitan area, perhaps Lombardy or Piedmont; here in Valle d'Aosta there was this situation. There are three, I told you before, ask all three, if all three say no, you will do what you want to do; if instead one says yes, give it to that one and if not they will decide, maybe they will even form a consortium among themselves, what is the problem? The problem is precisely the merit of the matter. Volunteering is a plus in this case, that's why we must favor them. It is not favoritism of any kind, it is actually doing good for animals. Allowing these services - which are partly economic, quantifiable economically etc., and partly instead arise from love for animals, which cannot be replaced with any payment - to be coordinated. This is the theme and this is the vision that, in my opinion, a politician in this sector should have. Then you have a different one, never mind. Of course, we do not withdraw the motion."

47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8794,"This motion follows an inspection initiative that we discussed a few Councils ago and which highlights a problem that we then talked about later, that is, the issue of price increases. A question of price increases regarding public housing which, essentially, arises from a modification and a different evaluation that was calculated by the OMI, therefore an improvement of what is the structure, of the neighborhood, of the residential area in which some public housing is located, which gave rise to a series of increases that were deemed unjustified and also to a problem relating to the issue of heating, on which obviously ARER also played its part, also making psychological terrorism, saying that the fuel was running out and therefore it was necessary to save it. Net of this, the topic of this motion is precisely the issue of rent and I will try to summarize it in a few lines. What is the issue? The question arises from this: if we take a payment method... we are talking about the free market, on the free market anyone can go to the landlord and ask: ""how much do you want for rent?"" and the landlord says: ""I want X"". If I am fine with it and I have the necessary means to be able to pay, fine, if I don't have them, obviously I refuse. In the public housing sector, however, it works differently, because I make an application, I enter the ranking, on the basis of what is a series of calculations the amount that I have to pay is worked out and, once I am in, if this amount is increased I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of not being able to cope with it. Banally, I have already given this example other times, but I think it is particularly evocative: if I am a person with a disability, who receives a companion pension of about 380 euros a month and anything can happen, even the Eternal Father can come down but I still receive 380 euros a month, I will not be able to pay a rent of 390 euros, but not even 381, because I get 380. It is therefore clear that if my rent amounts to 381 euros, considering that I do not eat, drink, move, breathe, watch television, heat myself and so on, it is clear that I cannot pay more than 380 euros. Today, however, unfortunately, many public housing units are actually subjected to this ""blackmail"", because it happens that the people who live there see their rent increase, they see their expenses increase. I gave some examples, I have here another of the many bills that I have received, for €909.90 for a council house (one month's rent, just rent, is €909). It is clear that if I have an income that clearly cannot change, if I am an elderly person, but also if I have a job that does not allow me to earn figures of this type, it is clear that I will not be able to cope with it. So what is the means that has been used by other Regions to prevent this cost from arriving? Because the problem is that we have a regional law that rightly has its own article, which is 42, which regulates the forfeiture of the assignment. The forfeiture of the assignment is indicated - it falls within the category of forfeiture - when four bills are not paid, therefore four unpaid rents. After four unpaid rents, the eviction procedure begins. It is clear that if I have a rent of 381 euros to pay and I earn 380, as I said before assuming that I do not eat, drink or do anything else but simply live and breathe, if I have a rent of 381 euros to pay I will not be able to pay it, so what happens? It happens that I, despite not having the possibility, not the will, the possibility, I open my wallet and 381 euros are not there, there are 380, so I cannot pay the rent. It will happen that I will obviously accumulate a debt, when I get to the fourth bill, fifth bill, sixth bill - sometimes there is a tolerance, this must be said -, a dear little letter will arrive saying: ""My dear, either you recover this expense or otherwise you get out of here"". The person in question clearly finds himself facing an impossible, improbable challenge, moreover even in this period in which private accommodation cannot be found. So how did they organize themselves in other parts, in other Regions? I gave the example of Piedmont: Piedmont did something very simple, most of the Regions did it in fact; Piedmont established a series of bands (bands that we also have, by the way, we have bands), but these bands determine the payment that I will have to make; therefore, depending on my ISEE and depending on the state of the accommodation, I will have to be placed in the corresponding band and then pay a sum. Here, however, in the part of Piedmont, they do something different and, in my opinion, interesting and intelligent: they say that there is a series of bands, there are 19 bands. The first is the support band: a fee is established, the so-called due fee, so you owe 100 euros a month in rent, but you are in band 1, and band 1 is probably dedicated to people who have an ISEE of 0, probably (and if I have an ISEE of 0, it is easy to think that I do not have the means to pay anything), so you will have to pay 35% of the due fee. If you have such a low ISEE, you will have to pay 35% of the due fee. Let's imagine that the due fee is 100 euros and therefore you want to pay 35? There is no maximum fee with respect to income for this first band, but there is a fee and in fact Piedmont tells you: ""You will have to pay at least 40 euros a month"". This is for the poorest band. Then, gradually you go up and gradually as your income goes up, you also go up with the bands. There is the protection band, from no. 2 to no. 8; there is the stability band, from 9 to 13; there is the safety band, from 14 to 18, there is the permanence band. What do these bands establish? They establish a maximum limit of rent with respect to my income. For example, let's take band no. 8, which is a protection band: it tells you that you have to pay 75% of the rent due, so if the rent due is 100 euros, you have to pay 75 euros. But the maximum rent with respect to my income is that it cannot exceed 16% of my overall income, so if I have an ISEE of a thousand euros a year, I cannot pay more than 16% of that ISEE, but because objectively if I take away funds for that type of expense, I then no longer have the means to live, so there is a limit that is imposed on my income. Do you earn a thousand euros? You cannot pay more than 16% of your income for rent and so on. There is, for example, the last band, which is the permanence band, which requires the payment of 240% of the rent due (I imagine that the permanence band is for incomes certainly probably higher than 20 thousand euros, maybe 30 thousand, I don't know) and the maximum rent is 20% of my income, with a minimum rent of 300 euros per month. So, there is a table that also allows me to know, in a transparent way, how much I will have to pay and that allows me to safeguard my income, because - and I repeat what I said before - if I am asked for more than what I have I will not be able to pay it and we will find ourselves with people who are evicted and then with social services that have to take care of the evicted people who were evicted by the same Region. So we have a person who is thrown out of their home, who then goes to social policies and says: ""Eh, but I'm homeless"", ""How did it happen?"", ""Eh, you threw me out through the ARER"". It's a vicious circle that is objectively absurd. If I don't have the means to be able to afford rent, I must be able to have the guarantee that it is a council house, that it is not aimed at a market, that it is not a system for earning money, but a social system of protection for the weakest people; it is clear that this system must ensure that I am protected. This is why, with this motion, coming precisely to the request that we have presented, and we have spoken about it several times in this Chamber, colleagues have also put forward proposals for the revision of regional law 3/2013 and it has been announced, by the Assessor, that work in this direction is being done, the regional Government is committed to introducing, in this revision, a calculation method that provides for a maximum ceiling on the rent, related to income, in order to limit discriminatory increases and encourage cost containment for vulnerable assignees."

47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,11987,"As you may have noticed, colleague Manfrin, I have not given any credit to any initiative discussed so far, as far as I am concerned. This one, however, allows for an analysis, but it is an analysis that is also connected to the challenging part. As you may have noticed... I know that you will then hold the initiative, but when I have tried to explain to you what the object of the dispute is, you will notice that, at the end of the day, we are right not to vote for it and I will explain why. First of all, your initiative starts from a presupposition, which is that, rightly, of the Piedmont Region, to be honest. Comparing the calculation systems of the Aosta Valley and Piedmont, it is necessary to take into account the overall set of the two systems, and not just some elements; in fact, in the Piedmont system, the households that reach an ISEE value equal to double the limit for access to the ERP, must release the accommodation. Therefore, the beneficiaries are people who are in conditions of actual economic fragility and therefore, consequently, limiting the rent to a maximum of 20% of the income has an impact only on the households that are in the lowest income brackets, given that the households with higher incomes must release the ERP housing. This is as far as Piedmont is concerned. On the other hand, in the Aosta Valley legislation, there is no ISEE limit beyond which it is necessary to release the housing; therefore, if we wanted to apply the same measuring stick as Piedmont, some Aosta Valley families could end up having to pay rental fees well above those that you have brought as a comparison. It should be remembered, in fact, that our legislation does not regulate a maximum ISEE value for the purpose of a possible release of the housing in the event of reaching economic stability, therefore, in technical terms, the fact of not having criteria for permanence that allow, as in other Italian Regions, the release of the housing, but also of not having defined criteria for permanence. You know that one of the things that is being evaluated in the table that will involve us I believe by the end of this month, because the President of the Commission, in his attention to the topic, has given me some dates in which to call me to address an initial summary of the research work that the University of Valle d'Aosta is carrying out to arrive at defining the new law 3, so consequently on that occasion I believe that we will have the opportunity to address some aspects that you all know very well. Fundamentally however, to make a slightly more technical analysis, you know that, to make a long story short, there are access assessments, access criteria to public residential housing and then there are permanence criteria. On the access criteria - we have already said it thanks to some initiatives that colleague Baccega has undertaken -, what is becoming clear, unlike other initiatives that we are discussing in this Chamber, is that in reality the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta is not a Region with a broad hand in terms of access to public residential housing. 3 is not a law that, in fact, was going to deal with access to public housing in a manner socially appropriate to the times - and that is why we are changing it. First of all because 3 reasoned in terms of ISE and not ISEE; secondly, because, reasoning in terms of ISE and not ISEE, it also kept out of public housing a segment of the population with perhaps some types of difficulty, for which the work that this Council is urging and that we are putting in place to vary 3 could give positive advantages for the Aosta Valley community. The fact of having an ISEE of 8,500 euros - because this is the reference parameter, for example - could mean that with an ISEE of 30 thousand euros for a household of six people, in fact we would be talking about 9,375 euros and today with an ISEE of 8,500 we keep it out; not to mention a whole series of aspects that have to do, for example, with disability and a whole other series of issues that we may address very shortly. Coming instead to the criterion of permanence, we believe that at this moment we are the only, or one of the very few Italian Regions, that applies to those who access public residential housing a lifetime access, therefore, fundamentally, when the family accesses public residential housing they remain inside the house - leaving aside mobility, because otherwise we complicate things too much -, however let's suppose that a family of four people, with the adequate ISEE, obtains the public residential housing, or commonly called council house, let's suppose that four of them enter and remain four for their entire life, in fact they would have the possibility of remaining inside that house for their entire life; therefore, consequently, also the rents, to arrive at calculating the rental rents, would be rents susceptible to the square meters, the age of the accommodation and the OMI parameters which, at this moment, in that area of ​​the city, are increasing, as we have already had the opportunity to represent for one of your initiatives. The OMI parameters are obviously not chosen by the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, but they take into account what the market is for each area of ​​the city; therefore, if the OMI parameters in the area where the majority of council houses are present in the city of Aosta are growing, it is because, in fact, it means that, in terms of purchases and sales, in that area of ​​the city there is a market. That is. However, the object of contention is that if we have - probably the only Region in Italy - still a law that allows a family unit to enter ERP, therefore council houses, and to stay there for their entire life, even to be able to leave it in some way to future generations, you understand well that we, in fact, are accompanying the entire life of this family unit during its social and economic emancipation. It is possible that a family unit that enters public housing in 1980, with only one working parent and two small children, then, during the life of the unit itself, ends up having two working parents or perhaps the reference parent who grows from a professional point of view, children who grow, needs that change, they can even become income earners, in fact all this is partly not collected by the experience inside the public housing, therefore this unit continues to remain inside this public housing. Well, if we in some way represented - but I say this only for correctness of reasoning - the commitment of his initiative, we could even get to the point of making this unit, for a series of reasons that are obviously not the reason why he wants it, pay even more than what it represents today, for the simple reason that in all the Regions of Northern Italy there seem to be criteria for which, once you enter the ERP, sooner or later you also leave. Indeed, there are contracts for public housing with variable durations that, in fact, are renewed and I imagine that they are renewed by evaluating the criteria for remaining in public housing. Then there are still other criteria, which are applied in other regions, including the Piedmont region, which even tell you loud and clear, obviously not from one day to the next, but through exit paths from public housing, that when you get to emancipate yourself as a family unit, you have to leave the ERP. Consequently, when you tell a unit (let's stay with the Piedmont region), that it has emancipated itself and has become a ""socially richer"" unit, you also say that it leaves public housing. So then, in the list of the calculation that you have represented as an example of this initiative, that unit is not there, while in Valle d'Aosta it is there. Since I know that you are very attentive to the topic and that you also know it well, not only do I agree with you regarding the fact that the whole issue of blameless default has a fundamentally social reason, so much so that in recent weeks we have held meetings where we have also involved colleague Sapinet, obviously only for the part of his responsibility which is not the social but the structural one, but, in fact, we have also written to the ARER, recalling the need to involve the social service upstream of any choice that has to do with staying or not in housing. And this thing will have to be increasingly strengthened also in the new 3; it is no coincidence that we have been allocating funds in this sense since 2023 and that with the next stability law we are trying to make it - excuse the pun - stable. However, the bone of contention is precisely the fact that if one were to reason about the entire multidisciplinary review of this blessed 3... ...What does multidisciplinary mean? It means that the access criteria must probably be adapted in terms, moving from ISE to ISEE, this ISEE must then include a series of parameters, naturally secondary, which are then those of the implementing resolutions, which probably must be calibrated on a different society from the one that existed in 2013, that is 11 years ago, including the Aosta Valley one. When you enter public housing you do not have to stay there for life, but there must be parameters for which you must be accompanied to leave public housing and then, consequently, the whole other front opens up that we often deal with in this Chamber, which is that of: are the council houses available today in this territory sufficient? How does the management of the number of council houses and all the social tools related to socio-housing hardship fit in with our territory, with the fact that our territory is a complex territory and with, for example, the PTP of colleague Sapinet which, in theory, does not provide for zero land use or to reduce certain things? So this is the multidisciplinarity that we will have to face when we think about ERP, but this is also the reason why if we go to take - and I'm not saying that you did it, let's be clear - only a part for example of the choices made by a Region close to us, we risk then later doing even greater damage than what we are doing today, because in a Region that, like ours, does not foresee the fact that when a family emancipates itself it is accompanied towards the private market, purchase, rental or other, but remains in public residential construction, if we go to apply the criterion provided in the challenging part of this motion, we will in fact find ourselves in the condition of going to make those who have emancipated themselves today pay even more. Which I also find correct, let's be clear, but you understand that later I happen to be called to respond to initiatives where he tells me: ""It costs too much"", but it probably costs too much also because in some cases, because in my opinion we could also get to do simulations with respect to other laws, we would discover, if we ever did, that, depending on the Region that we are examining, there would be some nuclei that would no longer be part, as of today, of the Public Residential Buildings. For this reason, I also tried to speak off the cuff, because you appreciate it; in fact I try not to speak off the cuff normally, simply because, as you see, I spoke for 13 minutes, instead the times are shorter and therefore, consequently, in this way here I also try to self-give the Chamber a little less of my face and my voice."

47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,7163,"Don't worry, it's always a pleasure to listen to you, especially when you speak off the cuff. So don't worry about your face, which we won't body shame and we are against any work in this direction; you do it and you take responsibility for it with the Prime Minister. But in reality we are pleased and I am pleased above all because you express a political thought that reading cold notes does not express. However, Councilor, you said a series of things that led in one direction, now then, closing the discussion, you said things that are basically opposite and different. I'll start in order, so at least we understand each other. I fully agree with you, with the fact that our Region does not have an exit system from public housing and I am happy that you, in the conclusion of your speech, said that this is not right, also because obviously I was afraid that you would say: ""No, but we have to keep everyone and therefore we cannot introduce a regulation or a device that contains rents like the one we propose to do"". I am happy that she did it, because it is clear that we have the data in hand of what are the ISE and ISEE of the people who are in the public housing and if you, as I imagine, have taken a look at them, you will discover that in the public housing there are people who have an ISEE of 140 thousand euros. Now, you will understand that, personally, if I met the person who with 140 thousand euros of ISEE holds a house, a council house that should be intended for vulnerable people, for himself, a certain indignation I would show him, saying: ""But excuse me, but with the income you have, can't you go and look for a house somewhere else and leave the house to a poor wretch?"" Since he nods and agrees, then the idea should be that evidently a limit should be set, exactly as the other Regions have done. So if we were to just introduce an income limit, we could free up some of those homes that are currently occupied by people who can afford to pay, have the necessary means to pay rent and are not at risk of not having a roof over their heads. However, this reasoning, which you agree with, undermines all the reasoning you have made for which this initiative cannot be accepted, because we are not saying, with this motion, that in the revision of Law 3/2013 this is the only thing that needs to be done; we are saying that, in the context of the revision of Law 3/2013, it is necessary to include reasoning and a calculation method of this type, because if the revision were to include a clause for which, once a certain income threshold is exceeded, I leave the home, it is obvious that a table and a mechanism of this type would also allow us to guarantee that the rent does not exceed certain levels. If you focus your entire speech on saying no to this initiative, on the fact that we do not have this thing, however, Councilor, you are using an argumentative fallacy that is objectively very weak. I say and repeat: if we want to provide equity in the assignment, management, maintenance, payment of public housing, in the context of the discussion of 3/2013, the reasoning of setting income limits beyond which people do not have to pay because they cannot afford it, because they cannot, not because they do not want to, is essential. All this fits perfectly and easily with the two issues you have raised: 1) the fact that, once a certain income threshold is exceeded, I must leave the council house; 2) the fact that council houses have become hereditary, which is profoundly wrong. They can be passed on to cohabitants if they actually meet certain low-income standards, we fully agree on this, but that's how it works elsewhere, so it's clear that our system and our need to revise the law must go in this direction. However, Councilor, net of this and in light of what I just said, not accepting this initiative is wrong, for the simple reason that either you say to me: ""No, look, in the motion, if you want to make proposals, you should include your entire proposal for revising 3/2013"" and if you want, I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for free, without having to hire idle university professors who have nothing else to do in life except occasionally make charity appearances for photographers and maybe occasionally apply for a job. In favor of these, if you want, free of charge, I will be your consultant, at your disposal, completely at your disposal, without even taking photographs, I will come and be your consultant willingly. If instead the idea is that we have to invent something to reject the initiative, because the initiative actually has its own meaning and its own value (and you have recognized it), but I do not know exactly how to reject it, then Councilor I am sorry, you know that we clash several times. I think that everyone, net of what the tones are or net of what the ideas are, sometimes coinciding, sometimes contrasting, recognizes each other's ability and value, both political and of expression, we cannot however say on this occasion sincerely 1) that the tones used are wrong, 2) that the proposals are not acceptable, because you have recognized it too. There are no real reasons why this motion cannot be accepted. The motivation cannot be: ""Well, no, but we have a system"", also because, and I'll tell you more, if this initiative, and what you said attests to it, were accepted and a calculation method were introduced, which I have highlighted, which acts as a multiplier if the income is higher, as the income grows, the increase in monthly rent for those with a higher income would itself be a mechanism that discourages the maintenance of public housing. Because if I end up with an ISEE of 140 thousand euros a year and I have to multiply the rent due, I only gave the example of the nineteenth, that is the permanence, but if we want to calculate it up to such a high ISEE, I don't know what the minimum multiplier will be, 1000%, 2000% of the rent due compared to the basic rent, and when a person who has an ISEE of 140 thousand euros finds himself paying 3, 4, 5 thousand euros a month in rent, he will do some calculations and say: ""Maybe it's better for me to release the accommodation and find one privately"". Councilor, in our opinion it is not a political point, it is not a question of leaving a testimony, it is not a trivial question of communicating one's idea; in our opinion this initiative, objectively, has its value and none of the reasons you have communicated have the value or the possibility of saying that this cannot be accepted. Obviously we will maintain the initiative."

There have been four years of debate on public housing, four years in which little or nothing has been done; more nothing than little. There is this process of law 3 that we have been waiting for for years. We hope that the law will arrive as soon as possible, because there are many issues at stake: rental fees, arrears, contract terminations, the issue of the housing emergency, the concept of adequate housing, the methods of assignment, the choice of housing... these are all issues that need to be addressed. But above all, probably, the regional tender must also be questioned, because there is also an interpretation of this regional tender, whereby where there is accommodation available in Pont-Saint-Martin, or vice versa, in Valpelline, it is assigned to the ranking and they are told: ""You are from Pont-Saint-Martin? We will assign you the accommodation in Valpelline"". It happened, it's not that I'm making things up, and if you don't accept it, you'll be removed from the ranking. But it can't be done like this! We have to be serious and the ARER absolutely applies this method. We know clearly that this law is not adequate, we are waiting for it and the commitment of the motion that was presented by our colleagues from the League also goes in the direction of making a more serious reasoning also with respect to rental fees: at this point, introducing the maximum text will be important and absolutely mandatory, also because there is no housing, there is no decent housing. It is true that a whole series of works are in progress, but we won't see them for two or three years, despite the promises that have been made several times in the Commission ""They will be ready, they will be ready, they will be ready"" but in reality we have seen very few ready ones so far. Housing is assigned that is unfeasible and is often refused, most of the time it is refused, and this is an element that must be taken into consideration. We will therefore vote with conviction for this motion, believing that this commitment must also be taken into consideration in the new formulation of the law, and we will be careful in this sense; and above all hoping that this law will be discussed as soon as possible, precisely to demonstrate what are the real and concrete problems that public residential construction has manifested over the years - because obviously things have changed in the last decade."

And surely there will also be attention on our part, because it is a topic that is close to our hearts, that these rents do not go to very high levels. There will also be attention on our part to check that this is something controlled and that it is good and correct for everyone. Therefore the Councilor said that he will certainly bring the modification of this law and we are willing to abstain on this motion."

47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,12,5337,"I realize that when we speak for 12 minutes... and I am not of course saying this to you, colleague Manfrin, who of course must find reasons to maintain the motion; because the motion is a political commitment, and therefore, consequently, it is also good that there are abstentions and votes in favor. This is all fine, but what I have just said is what we are already doing, in the sense that the indications that have been given, and which among other things, independently of those that we would have given, are being collected in the study phase for the review of law 3, are those that I have represented in the introduction, that is, I have clearly explained the fact that to date our law 3 is highlighting: 1) entry requirements that are not adequate to those that are the reference parameters for a society like the Aosta Valley one today, that is, with an ISE, not with an ISEE, at 8,500 euros we are in fact going to identify a segment of our society that is not the only one that we should involve in order to have a council house. There are other groups, which are groups in difficulty, but perhaps not in absolute poverty, which should, with the use of the ISEE and not the ISE, be involved in the future law 3. 2) The next review of law 3 will have requirements that will include the fact that a family unit that emancipates itself, therefore a family unit that improves its situation, no longer has the right to remain in a council house. When this is possible, at that point it will also be possible to include what is made evident by your initiative. Therefore the motion cannot be voted on, but, in political terms, we absolutely agree with what you are representing and which will be identified at the level of law 3, because, to date, those that are the requirements that include that a family unit that is well off is already out of the ERP, are in fact not taken into consideration. 3) The fact that in all respects all of this will have to be managed upstream by social policies and therefore, consequently, the fact that everything that has to do with public housing must be placed under the umbrella of socio-housing hardship; therefore, consequently, even everything that is decided with respect to a nucleus must be included within a whole series of initiatives that, in fact, have to do with the attention that the Department of Social Policies is already making available to the reference nucleus. 4) When this type of choice has to be made, as also recalled by colleague Baccega, probably at that point it will also be necessary to take note of the fact that there is a need to have a whole other series of tools to be placed alongside public housing with respect to the issue of socio-housing hardship. Surely today, rental support is one of the tools available to the vast world of socio-housing hardship that is working in this region, and in the long run we should probably also make a whole series of assessments regarding the social emancipation of a family that has been in council houses for a very long time, but all of this, including the numbers I gave you, is a snapshot of what the 3 was not taking into consideration. If I am telling you all of this, it is because, in fact, all of this is absolutely in progress. Then I understand what my colleague Baccega is saying; obviously I cannot agree with him regarding the fact that, over the course of these three and a half-four or five years, no political choices have been made on public housing, but this is part of the different roles we have in the Council at the moment. What I am saying, however, is that, regardless of the assessments that my colleague Manfrin always sympathetically represents with respect to his vision of those who are also collaborating on this thing, in this specific case, leaving people alone, and instead arriving at the research studies, what we can absolutely represent is that these studies are from the end of 2023-beginning of 2024, so if we were able to arrive by the month of November to already have a synthesis, which has taken into consideration a whole series of numbers with a series of possible solutions, given that then after the research study that was commissioned to the University of the Aosta Valley also includes a synthesis of a proposal for a new 3, probably, without giving reason to those who say that we have done nothing, because it is not true, to all intents and purposes we would have absolutely already given very strong directions for the 3 to adapt to the Aosta Valley society of 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, etc. All that I am representing to you, obviously, is an administrative space-time perspective for different roles, which sees the solutions in the same way, that is, we all agree that the 3, as it works today, cannot work in the future and therefore probably what will become the new 3 will also have the possibility of exit or the invitation to exit from the Public Residential Building of the nuclei that have emancipated themselves and therefore then, consequently, also has the possibility of applying this which is what this motion provides for today."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,13,35,"Councilor Manfrin, you have the authority."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,5316,"Councilor, you see, this is one of the few times, I must confess, that I see you particularly having difficulty defending a choice that you make, a choice of the Chamber, obviously. I see you having difficulty because you usually have a motivation, whether you agree with it or not, and, on the basis of this motivation, you try, in a different way, with various modulations on the theme, to convince the interlocutor, or at least the listener. Instead, you are already the third different motivation that you have given for the failure to accept this motion. So, you said in order: that this motion cannot be accepted because there is no rule that provides for the exit from council houses; then you said that the acceptance of the inclusion of what we are asking for in the revision of 3/2013 would lead to an increase in rents that would lead to the removal of people, that is, exactly the objective that we then set ourselves to include in 3/2013, people who obviously improve their economic condition. Then now you told us, Councilor, that what we are asking for you are already doing, which is more or less what perhaps colleague Di Marco said. So, you see, Councilor... Interruption off microphone No, I have no idea what you in the majority share, but perfect... I have no idea what you share: I listened to the declaration of vote of colleague Di Marco and therefore, on the basis of that, I intervene, if I may. What is the issue? The issue is very simple: that this is a system that works, that is, I set an income limit beyond which I cannot pay, therefore I have an income X, I can pay a maximum of Y, no more, because otherwise I don't have the money. That the system can be inserted in the perspective of the review: we do not write in the request that it must be inserted now, we ask that it be inserted in the perspective of the review. If you say that there must be a tool to first let out the people who have improved their condition, it is clear that the two things must be done together. So, at the moment in which you are introducing a modality for which people who have improved their economic condition must leave, it is compatible with the approval of this motion that asks exactly in that modality of concord, that modality of elaboration with respect to the new law, to also insert a new calculation modality. So that you are already doing it, Councilor, is not a motivation, but you did not say it in your speech, you said something different. Regardless of this, now you have evoked another issue, that is the issue of the study. I am sorry, I do not want to talk about people, net of the things that make us smile, make everyone smile here, because the world is small and the Aosta Valley even more so, but the thing that comes to mind, I ask myself: ""But what is the competence of the people who are elaborating these studies?"" because that is the problem, do you understand? Because of the people who are elaborating these studies, I would really like to know what competence they have to tell us what needs to be done. What competence do they have? Because if the competence is to be university professors who teach a subject that has nothing to do with public housing, I'm sorry, but unfortunately there is no competence, there isn't, and being part of associations or foundations is not a requirement that makes you compatible with the position, do you understand? If a person who doesn't have the competence tells me what I have to do with a regional law, I objectively and sincerely cannot accept that assessment, regardless of who it is; but if we take the curriculum, and we have seen the curriculum, we know that the competences are not there; and this is a concern, because then the effects of that very elaborate law will be discharged, exactly as happened with 3/2013, on the innocent roommates, because maybe tomorrow there will always be someone in charge who thinks he is a condominium administrator and simply has to harass people to ask them for rent, instead of understanding the social difficulties. So what you just said is welcome, that is, the fact that public housing must be managed in concert with social policies. It is correct, it is the correct approach, I completely agree, it is one of the few sensible things we have heard in this discussion. Welcome. However, the fact that all this is cited as a reason for not accepting the motion, honestly, Councilor, has nothing to do with it, it is not an obstacle, on the contrary, the two things can go hand in hand: the exit from the ERP as well as the setting of an income limit. Did you want to give a reason? Councilor, you failed. If you want, do not vote for the motion, I think things are clear, but this will evidently remain a stain on a debate that, in my opinion, should instead be a participatory and perhaps shared debate, because a law of this type will regulate, as you rightly said, the public housing of the future and we are talking about the fate of thousands of fragile people who, if faced with the wrong choice, will pay a high price."

In reality, my previous intervention was brief precisely because we are waiting to see that holy document that will be called law 3, which we have been requesting for years, 4 years, and if my previous statement was that little or nothing has been done, then there are the data, there is my colleague Chatrian who is good and says: ""The public administration speaks through actions and the public administration speaks through results"". The results are there for all to see: there is a list of over 600 people waiting for council housing, a series of rather significant evictions have been carried out over the years, there are people sleeping in their cars, the rents are not adequate, they are rents that need to be reviewed, obviously, the condominium fees, for those families who are in serious economic difficulty, are exorbitant because they have been forced to connect to Telcha, this is the data. Innocent default is default that has been financed but, in reality, spends little because they are all households that have not had a reduction in income because those defaulting households are in some way either retired or unemployed, this is the actual data. This is the data that allows me to affirm that in these years little, or very little or nothing, has been done. In the years that you know, we were together, you will probably remember some steps, every year we assigned 120-130 homes to the ranking, there was mobility, and there were not the resources that there are now. If we had had the resources that there are now, we would have had a great time, because we would have gone to do a much more profitable job, probably the fifth batch would have been done earlier, etc. So these are the statements, we really hope to see that document as soon as possible to compare, to make some reflections, some evaluations on the new bill that we hope can give the Aosta Valley community concrete answers and update this data that I have given you."

We all know that the bill: ""Provisions on public safety, protection of personnel in service, as well as victims of usury and the prison system"" has been approved in the Chamber. This bill is now in the Senate. We highlight that in the 38 articles of the ""Security"" bill there are 13 new types of crime, plus various aggravating circumstances, including: article 10, which provides for imprisonment of up to one month for blocking a road or railway committed by an individual and from six months to two years if the crime is committed by several people together; article 15, which opens the possibility of prison also to pregnant women and mothers, and to newborns; English: Article 19, relating to crimes of violence or threat and resistance to a public official, with the aggravating circumstance provided for if the act is committed to prevent the construction of a public work or a strategic infrastructure, such as, for example, the bridge over the Strait or the Turin/Lyon railway line; Article 28, which authorizes public security agents to carry certain types of firearms without a license; Article 32, which provides for the closure of businesses for 5 to 30 days for shopkeepers who sell SIM cards without identifying customers and so on. With all these new rules inserted, the Government has decided to want to manage numerous social issues, in our opinion, in the most illiberal way possible, that is, by repressing with the use of the penal system of prison, rather than opening up to dialogue and listening, while intervening to alleviate the problems that afflict citizens, which is what we would expect from a democracy. For us, balancing security measures with the protection of individual freedoms is important and for this reason we recall the principle that security policies should in no case compromise the fundamental rights of citizens, such as privacy, freedom of movement and expression. In this sense, there is already an initial response to what colleague Manfrin was saying today, because this flyer was on the union noticeboard, in my opinion, rightly so, because even the workers' right to demonstrate is affected in some way. I highlight this because it seems to me that, from what he said, then I did not check on the union noticeboard, but it is not that all the initiatives are there... evidently there are initiatives that are more dedicated in some way to workers. I have not analyzed with the attention that my colleague has given to the issue of the noticeboard, but an initial response, in my opinion, is there. A right, which is the right to demonstrate, is currently being somewhat limited by the ""Safety"" decree, so I think it is important for workers to know that demonstrating can become a crime against them. We also believe it is important to provide for monitoring and transparency mechanisms for the new measures so that their application can be controlled and that they do not lend themselves in some way to abuse. Democratic control is essential to prevent the tightening of safety regulations from being used disproportionately. This is why the challenge is very simple. In the meantime, we will understand what our colleagues think, many of us participated in those demonstrations, they also authenticated signatures, so, from a certain point of view, they have also taken action on this issue and what we would like to somehow bring out is what the Chamber thinks, certainly having some certainties with respect to the person in front of me, because I can already imagine what they will say. The commitment, however, is to activate the regional government, to take action towards the Aosta Valley parliamentarians so that the national government and the Parliament are asked to remove this bill, which for us is in some way also an attack on democratic principles that we believe to be important. As I was saying, I can already imagine what some people will say, but this is our thought and therefore we also wanted to submit to the Chamber and understand what our colleagues think about it. It is noted that from 7:41 p.m. President Bertin resumes the presidency."

You cannot intervene by blocking people! Because otherwise everyone here invents a motion and while you are speaking, since I invent something, you interrupt me or I interrupt you.

The suspension of the discussion is specified, if you look, in attachment 24, because ""the Rules of Procedure Committee, in the meeting of 23 November 2000, decided not to generally admit points of order for the verification of the quorum that interrupt the speech in progress of a Councillor, while other points of order for a point of order made during the speech remain admissible, leading in that case to its temporary interruption"".

The so-called ""security decree"", which some have rightly renamed ""repression decree"", is a liberticidal law, which brandishes the Penal Code against unions, students and all those who want to express their dissent even in a non-violent way, a decree that responds to the problems and social injustices of our country by increasing penalties, disregarding our Constitution. These rules, in addition to not solving the problems, aggravating the work of the police forces and clogging up the courts even more, will only worsen the current situation, creating a climate of greater insecurity among citizens.

We believe that the ""Security"" decree corresponds to the needs of the country to guarantee respectful coexistence between citizens. I have listened carefully to positions that are legitimate, but that we do not share at all and that are distant from our way of seeing the organization of society. Saying that we need to work on the education of citizens who live in hardship or who have problems is a fine declaration of intent, in two or three generations we will see the results. In the meantime we find citizens, according to what you say, who can afford to illegally occupy a property, someone else's private property and should not be punished. There are citizens who can demonstrate in the middle of a highway, who can block the country, who can block railway lines, who can block transport. In your opinion, does this mean demonstrating? Democratic demonstrations are done in a different way because of our way of interpreting the organization and democratic life of a country. It seems to us that, in this respect, there was a need to intervene, because we must also be respectful of the freedom of others. It is not that because I claim a right, my freedom, I can undermine the overall organization of society. There are ways to express one's principles, one's voice and one's ideas, in our opinion, in a very different way from those we have heard represented. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we are deeply convinced that we need a little more security in this country, that we need conditions that guarantee the conditions for everyone to live peacefully. In our way of seeing and interpreting the institutional organization, we cannot allow the lives of others to be undermined.

I therefore referred to the facts that undermine the honorability of a Councilor. Having been the recipients of some invitations, I thought it was important, given that the person responsible for it was the first to point the tip, the lighthouse, the finger at other people, to point out this passage, but we will talk about this, since the recordings are there, so we will have the opportunity to talk about this later, don't worry. As for the merit of the initiative, I would like to thank my colleagues in a very calm manner, because I believe it is indeed an important topic, on which the discussion allows us to express our thoughts and allows us to express them in a way that is in any case different between us and you, who proposed it, and we appreciated, I personally also appreciated the calm tones with which you rightly expressed your opposition. I appreciated it a little less, but that's part of the game... and I understand the rather agitated intervention of those who, unfortunately, are gagged so as never to be able to speak, especially when there are issues that concern something they would like to have a say on, so as not to have their last remaining voter stolen from them, by the very two colleagues who proposed this initiative and instead are always forced into silence... in fact I saw some colleagues with particularly dark faces, while the colleague who intervened with this vehemence was throwing out weeks and weeks of brooding, of unexpressed words. To get to the merits of the initiative, let's say that even with respect to what has been said, colleague Guichardaz, certainly, when you intervene on the merits of demonstrations, you limit the right to demonstrate, but let's not forget that the right to express one's dissent is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is clear that I cannot do it in the ways I like best, but I have to follow certain rules. Obviously the Constitution also provides for the application of the rules for demonstrations. For demonstrations, it has already been said, but I think it is important, a stop has been put to some methods that objectively had proven to be particularly wrong to express one's thoughts. I believe that there is no problem, and there never has been, in organizing initiatives, public meetings, parades, marches. We have also seen it here in Valle d'Aosta, several have been done and, when they are peaceful, they do not create any problems. It is different when these then intervene and perhaps suspend a public service or create an obstacle. We have all seen, for example, the famous initiatives that have become quite famous throughout the world... in one part of the world, in the Western world, the one that allows you to do it because in others they are not allowed. I don't know, those who demonstrate for the climate, I don't know if they are all called ""Fridays for future"" or have different acronyms. The traffic block that is being implemented obviously has some big problems: if I block traffic, I don't just block the person who is going to the cinema, I block the person who is going to work and perhaps risks being fired, I block the ambulance with a person on board who risks dying, I block a series of connections that certainly do not help attract attention, indeed they are even counterproductive for two reasons: first, people who remain stuck in traffic are certainly not happy and certainly do not get passionate about the issue; secondly, cars stuck in traffic certainly produce much more CO2 by remaining stuck there, certainly those are not the methods. I have heard of the crime of riot and the ""anti-Gandhi law"", which however has actually been used incorrectly because this type of crime was introduced for prison inmates and this law provides that ""anyone inside the prison who participates in a riot through acts of violence or threats or resistance to the execution of orders given committed by three or more people gathered together is punished with imprisonment from 1 to 5 years"". Acts of resistance are also passive resistance behaviors: imagine, for example, the walks and the prisoners who refuse to return to their cells as a protest when they have to go back. We have clearly seen acts of protest of that type. Prisoners clearly have all the rights, they have lawyers who visit them in prison, they can demonstrate what they want, there are methods in those facilities that are not good and these methods, this same type of situation is foreseen for the detention and reception centers of migrants. It is not therefore for all demonstrations, but for some typologies. Then we talked about detained mothers with children. We addressed a problem that unfortunately was a serious problem, because there was a reiteration of crimes by mothers, who in reality hid behind their children to avoid ending up behind bars and who used this as an excuse to continue to pickpocket. Perhaps in our reality we notice it less, but in the situations that have subways or trains, unfortunately, this is a reality that is very present and has become a plague. I think that anyone who watches the news can notice it. Clearly here we are not talking about taking and throwing people behind bars, but, since here the sentence provides for a postponement, in that case the execution of the sentence will not be postponable, not always, but ""if the judge identifies the risk that further crimes could be committed and it can take place in an institute with attenuated custody for detained mothers"". Penalties are also being increased for those who employ minors for begging and the maximum penalty goes from 3 to 5 years. Again: cannabis was mentioned. This Government has said it from the beginning: we are evidently against the use of drugs, whether soft or hard, we rightly do not make this type of distinction. I honestly have only one thing to say: I feel very sorry for those who, to get through their day, find their personal relaxation or outlet in ""sniffing"" a bit of drugs. I feel very sorry for them and, honestly, I think that there are different ways, different ways of being able to live one's life and also of being able to find a moment of leisure and relaxation. What was said about the sentences is indeed true, but the Government, obviously, from this point of view, will continue to move forward. Again: we talked about the demonstrations and the sit-ins. There will be a blockade, as we said, not only on the road but also on the tracks, because unfortunately one person on a track is enough to completely block a train and a connection. We realize what can obviously happen. What has been said... the aggravating circumstance of dissent on works of great importance has unfortunately become necessary because, for large works that are indispensable for our country, such as the TAV, unfortunately it has come to urban warfare in order to defend a work that is truly indispensable and to connect Corridor 5, which unfortunately is a necessity. Moreover, for example, the Democratic Party has never denied this position and the need to build this work when it was in government. I believe that this was a necessity for everyone, not just for one political party. Furthermore: the penalties for damages in demonstrations have been increased. Indeed, demonstrating peacefully is not only permitted, but is encouraged. It is right to demonstrate and I much prefer those who demonstrate, who expose themselves, who show that they do not agree in an absolutely peaceful way compared to those who perhaps disguise themselves and go and smash shop windows, go and smash cars and perhaps smash the cars of some poor guy who has to wake up and go to work that day, who has absolutely nothing to do with it, but, ""since I have to demonstrate, I smash everything"". We remember the interview with that boy who said: ""Well, if you don't smash things at demonstrations... that is, a mess!"". Those people unfortunately must be punished and deserve to be punished, it is quite obvious. Again: there is an extension of the urban DASPO. We also believe this is a useful measure to be able to restore some order in those cities that are certainly today, unfortunately, also prey to petty crime, which is defined as micro, but which in reality the people who live those realities feel in an important way on their own skin. In the manifesto, in the flyer that was then put on the union noticeboard, it was said that migrants are being blamed. You also said it, colleague Guichardaz, in your speech. Why? Because it simply inserts a common sense rule, that is, it is not that we are blaming someone, it simply creates the situation whereby, in the event that companies were to sell SIM cards without observing the identification obligations for customers, the sanction of closing the business or activity for a period of 5 to 30 days is applied. It is clear that SIM cards cannot be sold to people who do not even have a regular residence permit, people of this type are in theory illegal immigrants and should not be in this country. Eventually, we know, you know better than us and you also know very well the associations that defend them, they have every right to go and ask for the right to asylum, they can do it and, if the right to asylum is denied, evidently they do not have the right to be here. If they do not have the right to be here, why should they be able to have a SIM? To be here illegally, perhaps to commit crimes? Because in theory, if they are not here legally, they cannot work, they cannot have a contract. How do they earn a living? I think these are questions that everyone should ask themselves, but common sense. I do not think there are security issues, as has been said. Arbitrary occupation crime. This has not been discussed, but it is important. The part of illegal occupation of housing has become a truly important situation and we are also suffering from some of it. Councilor Marzi knows it... I imagine Councilor Sapinet also knows it by virtue of their occupation of the residential building part, there are people who have unfortunately occupied housing illegally, even council houses, and unfortunately send them away... not those who cannot pay because they cannot afford it, but those who occupy these houses because they do not have the possibility of finding another, but they clearly abuse a right... it is obvious that they absolutely must be evicted. In fact, the crime is introduced because ""anyone who occupies and holds without title a property intended for someone else's domicile or prevents access to it by the legitimate owner is punished with a sentence of 2 to 7 years. The rule? this is a great novelty? also applies to appurtenances such as garages, courtyards, balconies, terraces. The same fate for anyone who interferes or cooperates in the occupation of the property, or receives or pays money or other benefits for the occupation itself"". The plague that exists in other areas of occupying public housing through third parties by renting it. Again: an aggravating circumstance for crimes in stations and in the subway, we said it before, that we do not hear but that are absolutely present. Then a whole section on the modification of the Anti-Mafia Code to make it more effective. Simply put, the interruption of benefits to relatives of mafiosi... if they interrupt relations with the relative who, in fact, has been arrested, or is a subject subject to preventive measures or subjected to a related criminal proceeding. Again - this is a rule on which we have really focused a lot -: the revocation of citizenship if there is a conviction for terrorism or serious crimes. ""The term for being able to adopt the measure to revoke citizenship for crimes of terrorism and subversion and other serious crimes is extended from 3 to 10 years and from the passage into res judicata to the final conviction sentence. It is not possible to proceed with the revocation of citizenship if the interested party does not possess or cannot acquire another"". Finally, the crime of possession of material for terrorist purposes: ""Anyone who, outside of cases of association for terrorist purposes and training for terrorist activities, knowingly obtains or possesses instructions for committing acts of terrorism, dissemination and instruction on the preparation and use of explosive or toxic substances for the purpose of committing crimes against State officials, will be punished with imprisonment from 2 to 6 years"". We believe that these are common sense choices. On this and on security, the League has evidently made very strong choices, choices that were in the government programs, choices that we have claimed and choices that are absolutely compatible, obviously they will be once approved in the Senate. Earlier, jokingly, I said to my colleague Di Marco who was speaking that it was not known whether my colleague Spelgatti would vote for the measure in the Senate. I have not consulted with her, obviously, for this initiative, but I can say with reasonable confidence that I will not be contradicted, that obviously Senator Spelgatti will vote for this measure. She will vote for it and apply it as is right, because evidently, just as we have suffered, unfortunately, in years of Governments that tended to see little alternation, saw a prevalence of the Democratic Party, which managed to govern even when it lost the elections, for once we have an elected Government that has obviously gathered consensus on a program and on this, evidently, will carry forward what it promised to do. Rightfully, regardless of the feasibility or non-feasibility of the motion, I would like to thank my colleagues for having presented it and allowed us to express ourselves and obviously I announce that, if the motion is not withdrawn, the Lega group will vote against it."

It is quite obvious that in any case I do not recognize myself, we do not recognize ourselves in the least in those who, in the name of Moloch, must demonstrate at all costs and with all means, impede the normal activity of a company. We do not recognize ourselves. They are visions, we respect the different position, but we do not recognize ourselves in the least, just as we do not agree in the least on disarming the Police Forces. In my opinion, in our opinion, the Police Forces are called Police Forces because they exercise and have force in the name of order, or they are Police Forces and it is permitted that they do exactly what the name, the expression expresses, otherwise there is a small philological or even simply logical short circuit. It is clear that all this is not just a question of fans, because we know, among other things, that unfortunately we live in a country where the problems are not even the criminals or those who commit crimes, or those who break the rules or those who make social life difficult with their behavior. The problem is those who support these people, and there are, there are political areas that do it, but I don't want to open this discussion. We are on the other side. We are with the police, we are with an order, we are with the rules, on the side of the rules and we do all this not out of partisanship, not out of fans, but simply because we put the safety of people in a society, in a community, first. The safety of being able to do your job, of going to work and not finding a roadblock while someone goes to open their business. We are for the safety of those who get on a train and know that at a certain time this train will arrive at its destination. We are for this safety. The important thing, however, is that truly, in a way that is perhaps unusual, and that you are not used to, colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli, I want to sincerely congratulate you, because you have highlighted a weakness, which has appeared very evident in this discussion, of the majority. There was a speech by colleague Di Marco that is absolutely acceptable. I can tell you this as a soldier on leave, very strategic, impeccable. He didn't bat an eyelid. I also congratulate you, colleague Di Marco, you have found the logical way, perfectly logical, to get out of the impasse of having to take a position of choice regarding this motion, which would have put the majority in a bit of difficulty, which evidently is made up of heterogeneous political forces, a component of the Left and an autonomist component, assuming that the autonomist component is not of the Left. However, the fact remains that the speech of colleague Di Marco had its beautiful placement, a logic, a logical thread, a guiding line and then there was the intervention of colleague Padovani, on whose contents I do not recognize myself, but I also congratulate you, colleague Padovani, because telling the truth is a sign of coherence. You consistently wanted to express your political position, trying to bypass on the Left, on the far Left, the protagonists of this initiative and of this motion, the signatories of this motion. In this positioning of yours on the far Left you have demonstrated that the majority truly has enormous heterogeneity, but above all this heterogeneity is not just the fact of saying: well, let's go and recognize the egg of Columbus. What does the Left have to do with the autonomists? Which is what not only we are asking ourselves, but the Valle d'Aosta has been asking itself since 2020. It reveals the fact that all this debate and this different positioning emerged after about twenty minutes of interruption, of majority meeting to evidently, I think, I presume, decide what positions to take during the discussion of the motions. So what went wrong? You decided that there will be a part, represented by Di Marco, which represents a part of the majority and then the other part represented by Padovani, who strongly takes a political position that bypasses the signatories of the motion on the Left. This is what is curious, this is what is important, this is what emerges, because it is clear that I could stay here and talk until tomorrow but I do not convince the opposing side, I do not convince my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli to change position. I do not convince you, colleague Padovani, to change your ideological position, but I ask myself: you are part of an area of ​​a party that is also represented by your two neighbors on the bench, by the president Bertin, by the assessor Guichardaz. So are you representing the party? Are you representing yourself? I would like to understand what the others in the majority think. What is the position of the majority? Is it Di Marco's position or the other position? This is an important element and this is the reason why I congratulate my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli. You have brought to light this absolutely contradictory situation and this is the majority that is governing the Valle d'Aosta Region."

My colleague Guichardaz has already said, obviously, if we are presenting this motion, it is because we are absolutely convinced of its validity and of the fact that the ""Security"" decree, the bill that was approved by the Chamber and that must be discussed in the Senate is dangerous and is absolutely contrary to a series of issues that we believe are important. I will give just one example, which is linked to... there would be many, but I will give just this one, which is linked to the issue of the ban on selling SIM cards to irregular migrants. I will borrow the statement that was made by Oliviero Forti, who is the immigration manager of the national Caritas, who said that this is a highly discriminatory measure, especially for one issue: because it does not only affect people who are in some way totally irregular, but also those who incur this ban and therefore will be deprived of this possibility... (intervention by a Councilor, off microphone) please! ...all those who are waiting for a residence permit, who have all the requirements, have completed the process and are just waiting to have that piece of paper that allows them to look for a job and be here, will also be deprived of this opportunity. I am also reporting the position of the Church, because this was in ""Avvenire"", which I believe has not yet become an extremist newspaper. I really don't think so. There are also doubts on the part of a whole series of magistrates, prison directors, who are worried about the effects that this type of bill will have. I will move on to the second part very briefly. It was said by my colleague Di Marco that this motion is outdated, that it makes no sense because in any case the bill has already been voted on in the Chamber. Now, the bill has been voted on in the Chamber, to become definitive it must also be voted on in the Senate, but nothing prevents some parts of that bill from being modified. If a bill is approved by one of the two Houses and the other branch of Parliament makes even minimal changes, that is, it does not vote en bloc on the text that was approved by the first House, this must return. The Senate could make changes, if it makes even small changes, the text will return to the House and the House will no longer vote on the entire bill, but only on the amended part. From a formal point of view, therefore, there is nothing that prevents this from going forward. Go and see, that's how it is. If it were not so, we would have abolished bicameralism in Italy, but at the moment it is still like that. Then on a whole other series of issues that colleague Manfrin addressed, in much calmer tones than usual, but because there had already been the previous outburst, we would have to respond point by point. We don't have time, it's late, we're tired. The motion will certainly not be withdrawn and the vote, as I believe someone else has also said, will then have to, as on many other occasions, be the litmus test of what people actually say, think and act, because otherwise they are words, words, words."

The Rules say: ""points of order or for the agenda or for the priority of votes"". Finished. What you invoked was a personal matter or, at most, you should have asked for the jury of honor, honorability. You had no right to interrupt Padovani. That said, therefore, even the reference to the evaluations of the Rules... they are specific, but you did not make any reference to the Rules, nor to the order of votes, nor anything else. On the motion I believe that in the end there is a specific activity simply to plant flags, exactly like the ""Security"" decree. Because the ""Security"" decree, you see, introduces and leverages problems that are real. How can we ignore the fact that there are real problems of public order? The problem is to understand whether the ""Security"" decree solves these problems, because this is what we need to talk about. Colleague Di Marco said: ""we are against it, but because we believe that this tool is a propaganda tool. Let me explain. If something is prohibited, because a whole series of facts are already prohibited, we do not resolve the issues by increasing the penalties. Because here we do great advertising, electoral propaganda. A whole series of crimes that you have indicated are already not permitted and so, if they are not permitted, someone should already prevent them from being committed. With this logic of saying: ""we increase the penalties"" do you think you are resolving the problem? Absolutely not. You see, when we go abroad - and, in some ways they are right -, they ask us: ""but excuse me, what is the difference between prohibited and strictly prohibited?"". If something is prohibited, it is prohibited. So you are making propaganda on the fact that it is strictly prohibited, but things already cannot be done. Today is it permitted to block the highway? No. From this point of view, that is why we say that this is an instrument that is absolutely propagandistic and, if the colleagues had had a bit of intellectual honesty, they should have recalled the contrary vote of our Deputy, who voted against already in September. From this point of view, we were already clearing the field on the fact that this majority, composed of people who roughly represent all the movements that supported the candidacy of our Deputy... to understand what the orientation was, but not because we do not know the problem! We know the problem, but, from this point of view, the instrument is an incorrect and propagandistic instrument, just as this motion is propagandistic, if you will allow me, because it is simply to be able to have a showdown within the Left area. We believe that the commitment is an unvotable commitment, because if someone had written: ""commits to urge the Parliamentarians to vote against"", it might have made sense, but what the hell kind of democracy do you have in your head? The excerpt. The excerpt of what? That is, a bill that is being discussed in Parliament... (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...no, but you didn't write what you want to excise. You spoke in general about the excise... Have you also taken on Manfrin's way of doing things? (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...so you're making a personal issue... no, because taken from the fact that you insisted, I think that colleague Minelli thought that that was an example to follow, therefore speaking over colleagues. The excise of what? In the request it is written the excise tout court, of the entire decree law. Look, it doesn't work like that. If it's a rag, say what you want to excise; if it's to vote against, say that we must vote against; if it's to vote against, we've already satisfied you, we've already done it. For something that has already been done, for us this motion, as it is set out, is unvotable. For the sake of dignity, we will not vote against, we will abstain, because you have presented something that is technically unfeasible."

A couple of times, however, you have to admit that you were caught off guard and this is one of those times. As I was saying, I therefore also understand the reasoning that you made subsequently, because you will never admit it, obviously, but, if there had not been this dispute, whether regulatory or otherwise, I am sure that you would not have intervened, nor would you have expressed an opinion. You would obviously have left, as you have done hundreds of other times, for probably one of your colleagues from the majority to express themselves on the merits. You are not used to taking a position and would not have expressed the positions that you expressed, because obviously today you have a bit of post-match tension on you and that is fine and I understand it, so we know well what happens. What you probably didn't understand, however, is what the content is, but I say it absolutely without animosity and without wanting to start a debate, also because we will certainly have more to discuss in the coming days. Article 60 of our Rules of Procedure establishes that ""points of order, or for the agenda, or for the priority of votes? are three different cases, so either a point of order, or for the agenda or for priority? interrupt the discussion"". We agree on this, we have established that these interrupt the discussion and interrupt the speech: that's why I evidently said... Obviously what happens? That, if I ask with a point of order to speak, therefore I interrupt the discussion, at that point I receive the floor from the President who asks me to explain the point of order. Which, however, was not done, because, when I asked for the floor to speak, the colleague was not blocked and I was not given the opportunity to explain the point of order. I therefore stubbornly insisted, because my right was to make a point of order. The point of order, which I then made subsequently, was precisely for article 58, therefore facts that undermine the honour of a Councillor. It is therefore clear that the failure to suspend the discussion and the failure to give the floor to the undersigned evidently made me intervene in a vehement manner, also because, as you will remember at the beginning of these three days of the Council, I had received a rebuke from the President, who had accused me of being... how could we say... he had told me that I was a little too shy. Since I have an infinite series of defects, but I am not shy, I thought it appropriate to re-establish things a little and the truth of the issues, therefore evidently I thought I was defending a right. It is therefore clear that the point I made was meant to interrupt the discussion, the discussion was interrupted only at a later time, but I believe that what happened is on record and we will be able to discuss it later. On the merits, I believe that technically my colleague Sammaritani can best express the position of the League, which will obviously vote against the motion, but I also think that it is not because, colleague Minelli, I let off steam first that I am kept calm afterwards: it is because it is precisely the anger that has come out of some of your close colleagues that has persuaded me that perhaps this is the best weapon. The best weapon is precisely to highlight that exactly, as my colleague Distort said, there are positions that are diametrically opposed within the majority and I thank you for your action, which brings them out in all their violence and in all their virulence, because I know that every initiative that is made, regardless of the justifications that are given, because obviously there is no one who intervenes with this violence and with this thirst for revenge, who then would like to vote for the one he believes in... what you wrote... the person who is on your right, but would like to be on your left, because he would like to represent an even more extreme wing than the one you represent... he would like to vote with every fiber of his body and, if he did not have these obligations of the majority, because obviously the things they told him to keep him in that position are two: one, you make him the President of the Commission and, two, if you do not make the President of the Commission and you do not stay here, the Fascists will arrive. Because they told him this, this is what happened and this is what is holding him back. I have a great passion for his resistance and stoicism, but above all a great respect for the great work done by another colleague, who has become multiple Vice President of several Commissions, who has to manage Commissions different from his own, and above all who has to try to contain and find a compromise when it comes to topics that he obviously cannot resist voting on or expressing himself. With a good tug of the ear, here he is... or with a good tug of the ear or with good consultation he always manages to bring home the result. A result that for him is a winning one and for someone else it is not, but, fortunately, the accounts will be done in the end. I truly thank you for having brought this motion and I hope, I truly hope, that you will bring others."

Evidently they are two different visions of how to manage a State and public safety in particular. Well, I must say, I do so because I claim a certain intellectual honesty, which I am always against... I have never liked emergency decrees nor laws made on the wave of emotion, therefore, when penalties are increased following a road accident, etc., I have never liked them, because I still consider them to be chasing events, which certainly does no good to justice and not even to the management of safety and justice itself. Having said this, I must say that what has been said, also by, for example, colleague Marguerettaz, who is always astute in his interventions, is not entirely correct. In the sense that there are many other examples of cases in which there are crimes that already exist, behaviors that are already clearly illegitimate and sanctioned by the Penal Code, but then they are detailed in greater detail because in a certain historical moment there are particular conditions, for which there is a certain particular sensitivity towards certain behaviors. I'll give you an example for everyone: 612-bis of the Penal Code, which precisely because it is called bis means that it was placed after, in fact you all know, the red code, stalking, harassment. These crimes already existed, these behaviors were already crimes, but certain aspects were detailed in greater detail because they wanted to protect women in particular, or in any case people who are the object of particularly serious behaviors towards relational life, social life. The same consideration applies to this ""Security"" decree, it is obvious. Provisions have been adopted that arise from a Government that has made a particular commitment to security and that is also evidently a reaction and a satisfaction, in quotation marks, I say in a good sense, to those who voted for it, evidently, because perhaps those who governed before had not done so. If you let certain things go, you let a sense of insecurity pervade society, you will probably then have to put some brakes on it. It may also be that you do too much, but don't worry about that, on the other side there is the Constitutional Court, there are the magistrates, they do it, they will evaluate. Many lawyers have also contested this decree, then I'm not looking at the political orientation, etc., because it is quite transversal, I must say, probably for the reasons I expressed before, the Order of Physicians, etc. Very well, there is no problem, problems are solved in the courtrooms, it will be the judges, it will be the Constitutional Court that will say: ""here you have exaggerated, this is even unconstitutional"". Very well, we will take note of it, period, but that is the issue. The problem is that clearly this legislative measure, which is in progress, was naturally the occasion and what better occasion for the Left to cry out about Fascism, repression, etc., etc., but this is in the game of roles, of course. The paradox, one of the paradoxes, because there is more than one, is rather that these things come from those who have never dealt with security, or have dealt with it too little, and have regenerated that insecurity in society that then demands these answers. Colleague Padovani, we do not need to go to the United States to be protected, we already do it here because, thank God, there is a Government that now we believe protects us, but before it did not. This is the fundamental issue. The other paradox is that precisely these criticisms of this system to resolve things, that is, to increase certain penalties and provide for certain particular cases, come from those who, in reality, do the same things, but in a much more subtle way, because perhaps they don't have the courage to say: ""look, I'm making a rule that prevents you from speaking or, better, if you speak about certain things, you are a despicable being"". They do it in a much more subtle way because they implement a certain marginalization, a contempt for those who express different opinions. It also becomes quite paradoxical, moreover, the fact that one could think of going to dialogue with the No TAV with dialogue and listening, because I really think we have the wrong approach. We have already seen it extensively. On certain types of crimes I can even agree, on certain types of aggravating circumstances or rules I can even agree on the fact that perhaps they could even be excessive, but, as I say, it is not up to us to evaluate that. On other things, such as employment... I'll give you an example and then I'll close, the arbitrary occupation had already shown the lack of legislation. It should be remembered that this article also talks about the emergency procedure for the release of the property. Here we really have to weigh up the mutual interests, that is, is it more important to protect the person who occupies the accommodation or the owner who, poor guy, finds his accommodation occupied and doesn't know what to do? This also happens here, as my colleague Manfrin has already mentioned, it has already happened here that someone, even with public functions, in any case of protection of public property, went to the Prosecutor's Office to say: ""they've occupied our accommodation, what do we do?"". And the Prosecutor had to answer: ""I don't really know what to do, let's hope he goes away"". Do you understand? This is the impotence. There is a need for regulatory intervention. To summarize, precisely, let's say that this type of measures are necessary: ​​they are necessary because people want more security and therefore, if there has been some exaggeration, precisely, the bodies responsible for clarifying it will take care of it. We will clearly vote against this type of motion."

The ""Security"" decree is for me a liberticidal decree, which brandishes the Penal Code and threatens penalties in order to erase any expression of dissent. This is sincerely something that, as a citizen, worries me both for today and for the future, but there is a ""but"", as they say, and I would like to thus get to the commitment of the motion under discussion. I believe that the binding, as has already been said, is in itself out of place, because the decree, in addition to having already been voted on in the Chamber by our Deputy, who obviously rightly expressed himself against it, would commit the Senator of the League to request the deletion of a provision, which moreover - and I look at the only colleague who has had experience of Parliament, the deletion of a decree in parliamentary law does not exist, I am comforted - is impossible in parliamentary law, which her party supports so strongly. I think that this thing makes absolutely no sense. Although I reiterate my total opposition to the provision in question and have sincerely not understood what the use of this binding is, which, among other things, my colleagues have said can also be interpreted in many ways, but then in the end we vote on what is written...

Second law for the maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024. This bill, aimed at the periodic maintenance of the regional regulatory system, modifies some regional laws relating to different areas and consists of 13 articles divided by sector of intervention. The aim is not to radically change the current legislative discipline and to make necessary changes aimed at improving the understanding of the text, better combining the various laws in force with the new regulations with which, in some way, they are connected. With regard to the working method followed, each Committee examined the articles of their respective competence and, where deemed necessary, made the appropriate changes. The Second Committee, during the meeting on 28 October 2024, examined the articles: - 3, which contains provisions regarding the regime of the assets of the Valle d'Aosta Region of which the regional law of 10 April 1997, no. 12, aimed at updating and simplifying the procedure for the sale of regional real estate. The aim is to reconcile the interest of the Region in not selling off its assets with that of not maintaining, in its assets, assets that are no longer functional to institutional purposes and that imply excessively high custody, safety and management costs; - 13, finally, containing the financial invariance clause. The Second Commission, in the meeting of 28 October 2024, expressed a favourable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Third Commission, during the meeting of 29 October 2024, examined: - Article 6, which inserts into Regional Law 18 January 2001, n. 5 (Organization of regional civil protection activities), Article 7bis, in order to promote informed and responsible behavior by those who are in the regional territory, with reference to the presence of risk situations present in the same, as well as in relation to the frequentation of mountain environments, taking into account the characteristics, morphology and climatic variables of the territory itself. The new law intends to promote a culture of information and a greater sense of responsibility, which allow to prevent, or in any case limit, the cases of people in danger and accidents caused by careless or negligent conduct, as increasingly frequently detected by the Civil Protection; - Article 8, which contains an amendment to the regional law of 20 November 2006, n. 26 (New provisions for the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads), in line with the provisions on the management of the safety of road infrastructures of the legislative decree of 15 March 2011, n. 35, in order to define the procedural aspects for the adoption of the regulations regarding the management of road safety along the road network under the jurisdiction of the Region and local authorities; - Article 9, which contains provisions on agriculture. More specifically, paragraph 1 modifies Article 18 of Regional Law No. 17 of 3 August 2016, which regulates aid intended for land improvement consortia, in order to ensure greater clarity of the law, so as to contemplate the financing of all expected project costs. Paragraph 2 modifies paragraph 3 of Article 23 of Regional Law No. 24 of 21 December 2016 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2017-2019), which establishes the financing, in the form of an advance, of certain aid provided for by the 2014/2020 rural development programme in favour of agricultural businesses. Given that some agricultural companies have yet to receive all or part of the aid from AGEA, the proposed article provides for a further one-year extension, until 31 December 2025, from the deadline for the repayment of the advance received; - Article 11, which amends paragraph 2 of Article 3 of Regional Law No. 8 of 30 May 2022 (Provisions on redevelopment interventions of residential and public building assets), in order to specify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, that the derogation, provided for by the amended article, to the general rule that sets the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees at 36 months concerns employment contracts aimed at carrying out interventions included in the national recovery and resilience plan, as established by Legislative Decree No. 80 of 9 January 2021. The Third Commission, in its meeting on 29 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Fourth Commission, during its meeting on 31 October 2024, examined: - Article 4, containing amendments to Regional Law no. 29 of 1 September 1997 (Rules on scheduled public transport services), in order to simplify the administrative authorization procedure, promote the effectiveness of administrative action by reducing unnecessary burdens and obligations, reorganize and simplify the current legislation. The objective, in this case, is to promote the protection of individual rights, limiting the constraints deemed not indispensable and therefore making public transport more inclusive, granting all categories of people with disabilities the possibility of deciding which type of vehicle to use; - Article 12, containing amendments to Regional Law no. 11 (Regulation of the organization of employment services and the professional training system in the autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta), making a series of interventions aimed at correcting and specifying the scope of application of the provision, also in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, in accordance with the principle of loyal cooperation. The IV Commission, during the meeting of 31 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned articles. The V Commission, during the meeting of 30 October 2024, examined: - article 1, which amends article 9bis of regional law 17 March 1992, n. 8 (Regional interventions in favor of a Foundation for the enhancement and dissemination of traditional musical heritage and for the development and diffusion of musical culture in the Aosta Valley), on all matters relating to the regional tax for the right to university study for advanced artistic and musical education courses, in order to adapt regional legislation to the provisions set out in Legislative Decree no. 68 of 29 March 2012, which contains a revision of the basic legislation on the right to study, which eliminates, in particular, the definition of the amount of the regional tax for the right to university study as a fixed amount; - Article 2, which contains amendments to Regional Law no. 25 (Use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region), regarding the use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region, to better clarify its scope of application by providing, among other things, the possibility for staff required to return, which may be in the afternoon or evening, to carry out their service obligations, to use the canteen service to the maximum extent of one meal per day; - Article 5, which replaces paragraph 2 of Article 39 of Regional Law 25 January 2000, n. 5 (Rules for the rationalization of the organization of the regional social-health service and for the improvement of the quality and appropriateness of the health, social-health and social-assistance services produced and provided in the region), in order to make it consistent with Article 7, does not provide for the approval of the program agreement with the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority following the amendments introduced by regional law no. 3 of 11 February 2020; - Article 10, which contains amendments to regional law no. 11 of 31 July 2017 (Provisions on the specialist training of doctors, veterinarians and dentists and non-medical graduates in the health sector, as well as university training for health professions). These proposed amendments aim to limit the regulatory constraint currently in force regarding the requirement of residence in the regional territory for access to the financial interventions provided for by the law in question. To this end, the intervention provides that, with regard to the additional regional specialist training contracts aimed at doctors, the additional specialist training positions with related scholarships aimed at graduates in veterinary medicine, dentistry and for non-medical graduates in the health sector and the positions reserved for health professions, access is permitted, provided that the other requirements are met, for candidates who do not possess the requirement of residence in Valle d'Aosta. The V Commission, in the meeting on 30 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles with the amendment to Article 10 presented by the Councilor for Health, Health and Social Policies. The First Commission acted as the lead committee for the bill and, in its meeting on 4 November 2024, examined Article 7, which amends Regional Law no. 28 August 2001. 17 (Regulations on the functioning of the Office of the Ombudsman. Repeal of the regional law of 2 March 1992 (Establishment of the Ombudsman), in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, in application of the principle of loyal cooperation. In particular, paragraph 1 of article 2quinquies of regional law 17/2001 is amended, eliminating any lexical reference that could be interpreted as limiting the protection action of the Guarantor of the rights of persons with disabilities to only persons with disabilities resident, domiciled even pro tempore or having a stable residence in the Aosta Valley, thus excluding those who are in the regional territory only occasionally. The First Commission, in the meeting of 4 November 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned article."

The general discussion is open. Are there any interventions? Otherwise I will close the general discussion. Councilor Manfrin has asked to speak, he has the floor."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,5859,"Obviously, as a group, we will evaluate the measure article by article, but I believe it is useful, indeed indispensable, to focus on an article that we have already discussed at the meeting of the competent Council Commission, which is Article 11. Article 11, which is included within this law, this omnibus, which should tend to bring results, necessary, urgent changes, in short, maintenance of the text. The question, reading this article, arises quite spontaneously and I hope that my intervention can serve as food for thought: what exactly is this article for? English: We read it in the report that is attached in the article and the purpose of this article is: ""In order to clarify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of real collaboration, that the derogation provided for by the amended article to the general rule, which sets the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees at 36 months, concerns employment contracts aimed at carrying out the interventions referred to in article 1, falling within the national recovery and resilience plan"". In essence, it seems that, reading this article... that without this intervention, the employees in question - we are talking about ARER -, therefore the ARER employees who deal with renovations, could not remain in service - who were hired tied to the project on a fixed-term basis - beyond the date of 31 December 2026, or that they could not be extended beyond 36 months. In reality, the article that is being amended states precisely... therefore this amendment here, article 11, is inserted into an existing law. What does this existing law say? In paragraph 2 it says: ""In order to ensure the recruitment of the personnel necessary for the operation of the project structure referred to in paragraph 1, in times compatible with the start of the interventions referred to in Article 1, limited to the year 2022, the hiring by ARER of two non-managerial personnel on a fixed-term basis is authorised, for a period of 36 months, extendable no later than 31 December 2026. On an extraordinary and urgent basis, also in derogation from the provisions set out in the regional regulation of 12 February 2013 no. 1 - which are the provisions for access to the Valle d'Aosta Single Compartment -, without prejudice to the verification of knowledge of the French language pursuant to Article 16 of the same regional regulation). So what changes with all this? Nothing, because it is already foreseen, that is, the fact that they could be extended until 31 December 2026 and the fact that they could be extended for 36 months remains, nothing changes for ARER employees. What changes? Very simple: Legislative Decree 44/2023, converted into Law 74/2023, in Article 3, paragraph 5, modifies, with exclusive reference to the Regions, autonomous Provinces, metropolitan cities and Municipalities, the provisions of Article 20 of Legislative Decree 25 May 2017 n. 75, which - listen carefully - on a transitional basis allows Public Administrations to stabilize personnel already in service as fixed-term employees at the same Administration. The new law allows this possibility to the aforementioned territorial ones until 31 December 2026. So what happens? The Regions, Provinces, Municipalities and metropolitan cities, until 31 December 2026, may proceed, within the available limits of the current staffing, following a selective interview - we imagine quite selective -, and following a positive evaluation of the work activity carried out, to the stabilization of the qualification held by non-managerial people, who, within the aforementioned deadline, have accrued at least 36 months of service, even non-continuous, in the last 8 years at the Administration proceeding with the hiring, who have been hired on a fixed-term basis following competitive procedures compliant with the principles set out in Article 35, Legislative Decree 30 March, no. 165. Verbis brevis or brevis verbis, the formula you prefer. Without this legislative change, the staff that essentially says that the people who were employed for the PINQuA and for 110% by ARER at the end of their service would have finished their service and obviously, if they had wanted to be absorbed by ARER, they would have had to take a competition. With this change it is simply said that the funds for the projects mentioned above are for the implementation of the PNRR and are not funds for the PINQuA and for 110 and, on the basis of this, these people can be hired on a permanent basis. This need certainly does not come from the State, it is not that the State tells you: ""Listen, since you have to hire me two ARER employees, change this rule, so at least you can stabilize them for me"". I strongly doubt that the State is concerned, given that you write that there is the principle of loyal collaboration with the State, of the hiring, of the stabilization of two ARER employees. We are therefore faced with a rule that has, as they say, a first and last name and that does not change anything, it is a bit like turning the mattress from the winter side to the summer side, unless you are the mattress, then the thing changes and in fact, the mattresses are there and there are two of them and they can be stabilized and hired on a permanent basis by the Public Administration with this change, which does not change anything, does not move anything and is not necessary. We, obviously, will not vote for specific regulations for mattresses, if you do... we wish you good luck but we believe that evidently a regulation has been made here, let's call it pre-electoral."

I will briefly intervene on article 11, a commitment already made on the occasion of regional law 12 of 29 July with the budget change. On the issue, the Legislative Office had discussed the matter with the competent offices of the relevant Ministries, with a confidential correspondence, a commitment therefore to better detail a rule, a precise provision, which gives the possibility of derogating from the 36 months in the use of personnel, which is a consequence of the activity connected to the construction sites in progress with PNRR financing of ARER, in particular the PINQuA financing, which is financed with the 23.2 million and the nine lots of works already all awarded, most of which have already started with work in progress, therefore a correspondence that remains, which is, as said, confidential and was going to better define and concretize this procedure."

I would like to focus on article 6, which is an article that has a very important impact on the future of behaviors on our territory, a mountain territory, a territory that has a morphology, characteristics, climate variables that are very important and this article underlines the importance of the principle of self-responsibility on the territory and on the usability of our paths, our roads, our outdoor activities and it clears a path of responsibility within the users, especially of the activities that take place on our territory. I believe it is a concept that in other contexts, including European ones, is already very developed and that must become a bit more commonplace, in the mentality of those who carry out activities and who must consciously assume responsibility for the danger and any critical issues that may arise when dealing with the territory, a concept of zero risk that does not exist and that is also part of this particular moment of climate change, including geomorphological changes, which characterize especially very particular territories such as the Aosta Valley. Within this bill there are other much more specific indications, this is a somewhat broader principle that I thought was right to underline and highlight its importance in this particular temporal context."

A few more words need to be spent because perhaps with this article we are trying to fill a legislative gap at a national level, a gap that has led to a jurisprudence that is much discussed and sometimes I dare say has led to jurisprudential distortions. It is clear that, by introducing this concept of self-responsibility, we allow each individual who faces the mountains, or ski routes, or other routes in the Aosta Valley even by bicycle the freedom to independently determine their own way of facing the route, of facing the mountains, but which obviously imposes at the same time full responsibility for the choices made. Doubts arise when this person is accompanied by someone who is responsible for accompanying them. All this to say that it was an important step, but perhaps the path is still long, so this article is welcome, but the invitation is that, all together, we work on it further to take a further step forward and encourage those in the area - I see that the Councilor who deals with mountains has booked - of these very skills... perhaps our representatives in Rome can work perhaps in future legislative productions to further clarify this aspect."

I illustrated an amendment proposed by the Aosta Valley in the hearing that took place in the Senate during the examination of the bill that deals with modernizing the 1994 law on mountains. I must say that with the various interactions that we had both with the representatives of the Südtiroler Volkspartei, and in particular Senator Durnwalder, but also obviously in connection with Senator Spelgatti, there was work by the Commission and then by the Chamber that allowed us to have, within the text already approved by the Senate, a regulation that concerns this issue that should also cover that part that cannot be covered by the regional law, in particular the criminal issues, which obviously cannot be the object of a regional regulation. We are examining, also with colleagues who deal with the issues of trails and the impact on tourism, whether it will be the case to further clarify the text of the article that has already been approved, which however is already a significant step forward. Now the law goes to the Chamber, I will have the honor, as a representative for the mountains of all the Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, to be heard in the Chamber, and we will return to the point if necessary.

47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Cretier,Paolo,1963.0,M,FP-PD,16,3482,"Good morning everyone. A brief, comprehensive statement, I would say, on this beautiful day of work that awaits us in this beautiful week. The omnibus contains a series of modifications, additions or repeals made necessary to respond to the maintenance needs of the legislation in force, which requires adjustments to improve some regulatory passages and its applicability. This is my thought. For example, article 6, which makes the companions responsible, or even ourselves, especially in mountain environments, but extensively throughout the regional territory, thinking - and sometimes having the ability - to give up reaching a goal and the set objective. Giving up saves lives, our lives, but also those of those who must intervene in extreme conditions. I quote an article read in a local weekly: ""Only the rescue of the Guardia di Finanza saved 48 people"" and I would also like to quote Hervé Barmasse for his declaration of renunciation in an interview during a climb in Nepal, which he had to give up for obvious reasons, however, in my opinion, every now and then the decision must be made and you have to give up. We are at the forefront of information, the very efficient Civil Protection system that we have operating here in the Valley, is always not enough, the foundation of article 6 is self-responsibility codified by the Civil Code and in this case the realization of other people's interests without risking one's own life or that of those accompanying us and at the same time of expert rescuers, trained but operating in extreme conditions. Article 8, the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads. The complicated network of rather dated regional roads physiologically requires ordinary and sometimes extraordinary maintenance interventions, with significant financial interventions to guarantee the passability and safety of the citizen, the worker, the student and the tourist who climbs into the Valley. Of course, it is also necessary to think about alternatives to avoid closure, the isolation of economic activities and give the possibility of re-entry, which are sometimes prevented by very dangerous calamity situations. Article 9, the issue of agriculture and the company connected to it. The timing is sometimes now guaranteed by a regional complement that will be approved soon, today I hope. Sometimes the changes in data management create too many temporal hitches in the pure reading of the data, of the value of the application, for which it is necessary to extend the deadline to 31 December 2025 for those companies in difficulty. In cases of repayment of advance sums, these companies - few in truth compared to the total - can have a breath of fresh air. Article 11, a necessary derogation to carry out the interventions included in the PNRR, strengthening the administrative capacities of the Public Administrations, functional to its implementation. These are just a few examples that are connected to the III Commission of which I am a member and the mission is in particular agriculture, health of the territory, public works and civil protection, directly linked to the articles mentioned above. As a group, we will vote on the bill for the necessary changes to openings and approvals to be made today. The Federalisti Progressisti Partito Democratico group will certainly vote on this bill."

We had closed the general discussion, we are in the reply phase. The President of the Region has booked, he has the right to do so."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,14022,"In reply to observations that have been brought in a somewhat disjointed manner during this morning's discussion, I note, in what have been some observations, a bit of approximation in the topics discussed and also a bit of poor punctuality and poor research of what has instead been a very clear path, which aims to provide answers, where they are useful, are possible, and are shared in their path, then more or less appreciated by those who must give judgments. In all honesty, however, I must say that the reconstruction developed by colleague Aggravi - made with great attention to detail - faithfully retraces the activities carried out during these months. I do not do this to annoy colleague Baccega, who smiles at these statements of mine, but because intellectual honesty, in my opinion, always needs to be underlined, even when not all situations have perhaps developed as expected. I believe that the important answers that are given within this budget variation, which is a budget variation that, for 95% of the financial resources put into question, corresponds to needs resulting from the flood phenomenon that hit us on June 29th and 30th... it is a budget variation that leads to the ratification of all those variations, including 21 million euros, that were activated immediately to provide answers to the population, through specific interventions carried out on the territory, thanks to the activity of the regional structures and the activities carried out on site by the Municipalities most affected by this phenomenon. Of those 21 million and some that were the object of these budget variations that we are ratifying today - and which was a path foreseen within the law that we approved a few months ago - these will be reimbursed, these yes in a manner already declared by the National Civil Protection, for approximately 20.6 million euros. The other 35 million total that are made available are resources that are made available by the Regional Administration and, for a part of these (relating to the interventions mainly to be identified in the 13.8 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Cogne, 4.4 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Valtournenche and 500 thousand euros mainly made available to the other Municipalities) a request will be made to the National Civil Protection which however does not yet have any type of coverage and for which there is still no type of certainty that the same will be refunded to the Regional Administration. Therefore this is, if we want to say, a provision of resources that, if they were to be included in the compensation and reimbursement account by the central Administration to the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, will be reused and reallocated in new and future interventions; if this were not the case, the Regional Administration would find itself next year having to implement those resources already assigned to local authorities to complete the work, to find additional resources that will have to be used to complete the initiatives to support the functional recovery of all activities - from roads to the technological networks affected - and it will be the subject of the next financial programming to develop and find this type of resources. This is one phase. The other phase is instead that of attention to the resources necessary to cover the material damage. In this sense, I also anticipate an assessment that, in my opinion, has escaped most people, and that is why I appreciated, in some ways, the analysis made by the minority colleague together with the illustration by colleague Malacrinò who punctually reported the resources allocated, chapter by chapter, on this type of intervention. The 3,900,000 euros allocated in Article 1 are essentially resources intended to reimburse the damages suffered, the material damages, by all the activities that were involved in the flood management and which are, as already underlined in other circumstances, intended for this by Law 5 (although improvable, although dated in some ways, a little more cumbersome) which we have even tried to streamline, accelerating the classic times of the end of the emergency, as classically set, and accelerating the possibility of making requests for financing and requests for support for the damages suffered - with a procedure that provides for the definition, through the appraisals, through the necessary procedures to then go to the disbursement - which will lead to a compensation, where those resources are sufficient, of up to 70%. Where instead, in the face of a situation more important than these 3.9 million - and I'm also going to respond to some exceptions from the Forza Italia group - net of what will be the compensations that will be evaluated based on the resources made available by the State Administration... they will complete that range of attention that the Regional Administration rightly must have for those who have suffered significant damage. On the other hand, the discussion of sharing is a discussion where the main lines of intervention were made available on what should have been the attention to be paid to the structures, to the activities, that had not had the opportunity to work, due to the flood, in the month of July. The choice was careful, fought and also shared and brought to the table of the associations, where there were different requests, but where it was deemed (in a very transparent manner, and also very seriously, in my opinion) to share a path where these resources were made available for a relaunch of the activities from a liquidity point of view. In some cases, the situations that had occurred could lead to compensations - as we defined them - of a few thousand euros, which as a whole would not have moved the ranking of companies that perhaps have to plan the next winter activity, the next seasons and relaunch investments, and we decided to significantly support the possibility of self-financing, both to restart the activity and to create the conditions for having functional liquidity for the acquisition of stocks and so on. At the same time, and I am referring to the article on the Ski World Cup, we believed that we had to include in this bill some propulsive initiatives, initiatives that, starting from a critical situation, could give an envergure, a relaunch, to this ski resort: we did this by supporting, from a political point of view, the possibility of having the Ski World Cup in Cogne in the month of January, and to support it with a very pragmatic approach from the point of view of the use of financial resources, identifying, as the beneficiary body of this contribution, the Municipality of Cogne, not so much to diminish the importance of a World Cup in Cogne or to make it separate from the sporting world, but precisely to make immediately effective the need to intervene and to plan an event of this importance in a relatively short time, which is what separates us from today to the end of January. Other initiatives have then been introduced on the sidelines of natural disasters, which we all know well, and have gone to support the business world across the board, within which there is certainly a large part of the businesses also affected by the flood, with support for initiatives in favor of the Confidi, going to implement - and it has been underlined, and I thank those who have done so - the goodness of this path which, in recent years, in the last two years especially, has seen an increase in interest rates for those who have gotten into debt and this reimbursement in interest of the expenses incurred by our companies will in this way be compensated almost entirely compared to the law, which provides for reaching up to 75% reimbursement of the interests paid, and therefore 1,600,000 which brings the contribution in interest to the companies guaranteed by the Confidi to 4 and a half million euros. And again, the possibility - as I was saying - of having particular attention to the territory through the Land Improvement Consortia in some situations that are worrying, from the point of view of urgency, for the areas involved but also for the seriousness of what the situations could be if they are not normalized and on which we do not intervene with a certain speed. To this, which is the universe of initiatives that, overall, count about 55 million euros of resources made available for the flood, some particularities have been added that are part, in a final part of the year, of those budget variations that serve to give the most urgent answers to the needs expressed by the structures and the territory, in a way to be able to close those interventions that are urgent regardless of whether there has been a flood or not; here we are talking about the Convitto Chabod or the swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier, where we can make comments and evaluations of a broader nature and on which we may or may not agree, but which require a closing of the circle and an in-depth study has been done, the Councilor has brought it to the attention of the Council Commission and I believe that this type of attention can then be partially exploited where one wants to do so, but I also believe that it is a timely response to a territory that for too long has not been served by a structure that has a very important specific weight. I am only entering into the merits, again, of an evaluation, which is the one relating to the Municipal Secretaries. If I were the one who raised this request in the past months, I would be satisfied with the inclusion of this clarification, let's call it that; it was debated from a technical point of view, the competent Council Commission had wanted and also heard the General Secretary regarding a comprehensive examination of the uncertainties that the Agency of Secretaries had also expressed regarding the new formulations and the situation had been clarified in some ways. I believe that this type of intervention provides greater interpretative guarantees and greater clarity - just as the opposition Councilors who had expressed this uncertainty over time requested - and I think that credit should also be given to these requests, to go and close a circle today. In that regard, I would like to anticipate what will also be the illustration, if we want to do it in more detail, of the amendment that we presented this morning and which goes, as shared in the Council Committee, to a principle with which a reservation is indicated, not so much to further complicate an article that has already been the subject of many changes in these weeks and months, but to support an intention - I seemed to have accepted it in those terms - of the Chamber and of the competent Commission at a time when there were two options on the table and we had proposed, within the norm, a path that was - if you like - more respectful and relevant to what were already national regulations in progress, but with the idea, where shared by the local authorities and by this Chamber, of inserting something more specific to the experience gained by the municipal secretaries in the last 5 years, and, in particular: ""Whoever had worked more than three years within the Municipalities, already acquiring a sort of familiarity with the activities to be carried out, could be considered a candidate for the post of secretary. carry out within our local authorities"". It is a path that, in my opinion, aims to clarify and also provide answers regarding what the effectiveness of the Secretaries (who are a focal point within our municipal administrations) could be and to provide 360-degree coverage of the needs to move forward with this call. I would stop here, thanking everyone for the discussion, also thanking for wanting to share the information, because in the path of sharing that has taken place in these months - net of doing it once a week, as someone said, or less - it is always very complex to be able to transmit, in a comprehensive and complete manner, every activity that is carried out on a daily basis. We tried to do it in compliance with a commitment made, but to work for the good of the activities that were to be done, and that are still to be done now, in wanting to signify shared visions within the Government, within the majority, and make them available as information and as a reason for evaluation by the opposition, who where they wanted to demonstrate their opposition or their agreement on this type of initiative were able to do so. Today is the time to have to give answers anyway, to close a circle, and this is a proposal that seems very balanced to us, which goes to give three answers, one to those who have suffered damage (and there will be a certification of these, there will be substantial coverage thanks to law 5), one to the municipal administrations, and, indirectly, one to the companies and communities that have been involved who will have the opportunity to work right away, from December, using the resources at their disposal to plan both the planning part and the work part that will obviously be carried out in due time, as well as the activities to relaunch the activities on the territory, through the Ski World Cup but also through all those interventions dedicated to the territory with these 55 million made available mainly for the post-flood but not forgetting the other things that, as I was saying, had to be brought with more urgency than other topics."

I believe that our vision and our will have already been abundantly highlighted and I must tell you, President, that in your reply you made a passage that is a somewhat cryptic passage and perhaps you can clarify it, if you want, because you said that there was a round table discussion with the associations and that there were different opinions. I did not understand whether the round table discussion with the associations, which reported different opinions, was precisely on the nature of the support that the Region had to provide to businesses. This is why this agenda is here, but above all this agenda highlights a topic that you have not addressed - and I regret this, and I hope that, before the end of the discussion and the vote, you will also have the opportunity to clarify it - namely the issue of the failure to hear the associations that we have indicated, because, objectively, it has been raised by all the opposition colleagues, and I found it incomprehensible. If in your speech - I am trying to summarize, to extract something that can go in that direction - you wanted to subtly say that there were indeed different opinions on the nature of this support provided to businesses, then you knew it and you culpably avoided businesses coming to tell us what they thought, because you did not want them to leave on the record, on the record, an opinion that was contrary, perhaps negative, or more critical, otherwise it cannot be explained. The sentence with which the request for a hearing was dismissed, namely ""They are not relevant to the law"" cannot be explained; this is an objectively embarrassing thing, so it is evident that it is not acceptable. However, coming to the commitment and the agenda, as we have highlighted and as we have reported, with this agenda we ask - and even more so if you say that there is the possibility that the funds that have been put to cover, in advance of potential support and assistance from the national side... - if there will therefore be coverage from the national Government of these funds, if the resources will be freed up with which a measure can then be established. Even more so, with this agenda we ask and commit the regional Government to prepare a measure, with relative financial coverage, that recognizes adequate compensation to businesses and economic operators affected by the flood events of 29 and 30 June."

First of all, I would like to point out that within the discussion that took place - and in which I feel he has always participated - perhaps it is also my fault, that I did not express myself in the best way, but evaluations that arose from a discussion mainly with Adava, who has been the most active interlocutor in this process during these months, have been highlighted and made available, also to colleagues. The options that had been highlighted and brought to the table, where she was also sitting, offered two types of opportunities: one to intervene with compensation, as classically understood, with a percentage of compensation of around 20% compared to the lost revenue declared by the categories, which had been identified, broadly, at around 4 million, which would have led - and I mentioned it in my reply - to compensation (which would have in some cases contributed significantly and in some cases for a few thousand euros) for many companies that had had revenues lower than 40% compared to the average of previous years. Everything still had to be certified, everything had to be lined up and everything had to be put into a context that took into account on the one hand what could be the limitations dictated by state aid, and on the other the actual reporting and bureaucracy that had to be developed in order to arrive at these reimbursements. The evaluation that had been proposed, and was proposed at the table, to which then no one said yes or no, rightly so, because then it becomes easier to perhaps go and criticize a choice that must somehow be made and say: ""No, but I preferred the other one"" ... very well, in the meantime we put one on the table and we think we can do it in the best way to provide answers, therefore we evaluated going towards a choice that could be more coherent and more positive also for those who suffered damages and for those who needed to relaunch their business, going to support them with an amount (in some ways even higher than what the individual reimbursements would have been) that however could have given all companies the possibility of supplying themselves in an appropriate manner to relaunch their season, to relaunch their work over time, making most of the resources available for a restructuring of the services that are part of the possibility of hosting new people, for initiatives such as the World Cup to relaunch the territory. I would also like to underline the commitment that there was on the part of the competent Councilor in a negotiation - that's what I call it - in a very close comparison also with the competent Ministry, which we will then talk about in the second of the two proposals on the agenda, where the Councilor and the Piedmontese Councilor have evaluated the possibility of including, where possible, also compensation in addition to reimbursements for material damage suffered, because in the Piedmontese territory, there were no structures with damage, so we collaborated to find a path that could give the two opportunities also to our territory, and I think that - net of the fact that someone is not happy and would have perhaps preferred something different - we have done a careful job and with the will to give the answer that we believe is best for this type of intervention. We did it in concert and also by comparing ourselves with the associations during the process, as we had also anticipated to you; on this aspect I think that the willingness, also on the part of Finaosta, to make available a product that can be appreciated, very streamlined and very quick to set up and activate for those who need it is an important example. Therefore, with regard to your agenda, we will abstain for the reasons we have expressed."

47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,8,5334,"Thank you, Mr President, for your kind reply, I also thank you for your opinion on my abilities, I appreciate it in a particular way, I am sure that instead you, accustomed to covering all roles, have developed exceptional capacities of understanding on all the themes of human knowledge and you demonstrate it daily, and we thank you for this and we thank Providence for having placed you in that position because otherwise we would have unfortunately had a serious shortage in the Aosta Valley, instead we certainly have a person who understands everything in the right place, at the right time, and for this we thank you. Net of this, you were very clever to say something like this: the choice is this because the way it was designed, that is, the way you had thought of it, therefore the percentage of lost revenue, the percentage of compensation, what came in, what was given, that is, the model that you had created was not good, and since the compensation model that you had created was not good, then that is not a viable path. President, but it doesn't work like that, it doesn't work like that at all! There are two ways, at least we said it and she admitted it too: there is the way you have taken of loans, and we will see - we have expressed an opinion - we will see how many people will resort to these loans, especially since, as we also underlined in the text, the winter season has already begun and there is still no possibility of adhering to these loans, so we will see how many will adhere to them, but above all we will see what the effect will be and what the draw will be on the measure, especially for those who have been in particular difficulty, because I put myself in the shoes of a structure that has suffered damage and clearly has to deal with it and does not have the liquidity to do so, takes loans that will then have to be returned and therefore will worsen its hole. This is a method that we will verify. He said, however, and I am happy, that there are two paths: there is the path of loans that you have taken, on which I also want to reiterate that it is not that we were given the opportunity to choose in the meetings, because we said so, we were simply informed, we arrived there and were told: ""We thought of doing this, we thought of doing that, things are like this, things are like that"", not ""Which path do you want to take? But do you think it is like this or that?"", we asked it several times, if you remember: ""Are there alternatives to this proposal, to this model, to this article?"", ""No, it is like this, we are giving it to you so you can read it"". It is not the fact of being seated at the table and being informed of what was happening that makes us in some way complicit; we have taken note of it and we have told him clearly, I think that transparency is absolutely impeccable on our part. She said she was happy to answer but in reality she didn't answer, or rather, she answered as she usually does, in her omniscience, that is, not to say: ""Well, yes, we prevented the debate because we were afraid that someone would come to the Commission to say: we don't want this measure, we don't want this proposal"", it would have been more honest instead of giving the President of the Second Commission the mandate to interrupt the hearings, it would have been more honest. ""We don't want criticism, we know everything, we have infused science, we don't want criticism"". Instead, no, but as she usually does, she says in her answer that ""Net of someone's dissatisfaction"", so one could read that someone is not satisfied, but what percentage of the activities does this ""Someone"" add up to? Because she spoke mainly of Adava, but we listed two other categories, Confcommercio and Confesercenti. Were these categories asked what they thought? Because we did, we asked them, and these categories didn't even see the text. We simply didn't want to have a biased opinion from one side to the other, someone preferred to say: ""You know what? No, we don't do hearings because ""it's like this and it's like that"" and they are not relevant to the law"". We take note, we will obviously communicate to the companies and trade associations that they are no longer companies, they must not be defined as such, because the article that establishes this possibility obviously does not include them. I'll tell you the truth, we had an idea for a moment, that is, to present an amendment that removed the word ""Companies"" from the article, because it is not relevant and therefore it was fine as it is. It would have been a provocation and perhaps it would have added something to the debate, but we believe that this is in itself evident, in reality, even in your response. It is therefore clear that you have made a choice, we legitimately propose another, then we will vote as is done in a democracy and we will see the result at the end and everyone, inside and outside this Chamber, will be able to know what one thinks and what the other thinks in a democratic way. It would have been nicer to also have the ideas of the people, but you are a bit allergic to criticism. All right, agreed, we will see how many you will collect between now and the end of the legislature."

47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,10,7267,"We too, as a Forza Italia group, illustrate the agenda that we presented regarding compensation following the damage suffered by the flood of 29 and 30 June. It is essentially a re-proposal of the agenda that we presented in the context of the discussion of the DEFR 2025-2027, in relation to the support for economic operators who are not affected by the compensation provided by the State. We believe that, in a perspective of collaboration between the State and the Region, it is necessary to address the issue within the context of complementarity of action and at an integrative level, as is done by the Region in many situations, I am referring, for example, to what we have already seen in the past in the context of initiatives in the world of work, training, where the State makes funds available in one sector and the Region makes funds available in the other, to provide complete coverage of the needs that exist in the territory. In this case, we must underline the constructive collaborative relationship with the center-right central government that has shown, in this circumstance and in others, to have a great consideration for our region. I would like to begin, in the introduction, from the first inspection that took place in Aosta, the meeting of July 2, with the Minister of Tourism, where the availability of a series of support aids for compensation was announced for economic operators, who are the responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism: 10 million had been announced, today 15 million were decreed together with Piedmont but I believe that the given word was kept, with the decree that was approved on November 11. After that there was the inspection in the Valley and the great attention that was shown by the Minister of Public Administration and the Minister of Civil Protection who came to realize: the Ministry of Civil Protection has made available, following the decree of the State of Emergency, 20.6 million euros to deal with the difficulties. The Region has done its part and I believe that the opening of the road after 27 days of isolation has been noted with satisfaction, an important job has been done to which all the regional structures have given their contribution. In terms of the approach that there has been to this budget variation, we had said in the illustration in the intervention of the general discussion, my colleague who spoke after me repeated it, that we would have shared articles 1 to 7 and instead, as regards the attitude on the overall vote of the provision, it would also have been in consideration of what would have been the behavior on this agenda by the regional Government. We have not made any confusion, we are very clear and we believe that the Region, for our way of seeing and solving this problem, should intervene to complement what the State has done, in the context of the activities that are excluded from the benefits that are financed by the Ministry of the Interior, because in recent days we have also seen in the press that someone says that it is a shame that bars are not included, so it means that they were a need, because, if the State had made money available, they would have been useful for these categories, not as is being said now that perhaps there was no need, because someone perhaps gets 1,000 euros rather than 1,500, rather than 500 euros and that it is an evaluation of an insignificant benefit. For us it is significant, therefore we believe that it would have been correct for all economic operators to have had the same approach from the public administration, but an integrative approach to the one that the State has set up, because we cannot always think of delegating everything to the State, we also have management responsibilities and therefore I believe that, like in a family, everyone must do their part: everyone makes available what they can make at the moment to deal with the difficult situation. I believe that the allocation that we have received from the State is important but if the State has provided for it within the categories included by the Ministry of Tourism, I believe that it would have been up to us to go and see which categories are excluded and intervene with the same methods on that type of activity. This is what we are asking for with this motion, nothing more; it seems very simple to us but also very reasonable as a proposal. We cannot understand the reason, the ratio why it cannot be accepted. By the way, it seems to me that on the issue of compensation for indirect damages, the categories have claimed it and requested it, so either the categories do not have a clear picture of the situation, or there is something wrong with the approach. We will support the measure in Article 5, but it is a completely different measure, which provides an answer not to the need for compensation, it gives the possibility of opening loans, but they are two completely separate things. We will vote on Article 5, but we ask to be able to go in this direction. To the colleagues in the opposition who said that perhaps this is the presentation of the agenda, it was also an opportunity to clarify to eliminate their own confusion, in the sense of approaching this initiative; I say that perhaps we are the ones who have some confusion lately because we no longer know what the positions are in this Chamber. We are increasingly grasping it and it would be important to understand what the real positions are between now and the budget because we will not find ourselves dealing with a partial matter like this, but we will have to manage, in about ten or fifteen days, the budget of the Valle d'Aosta Region. Our spirit is a very clear spirit, everyone knows what our position is, a central position of Forza Italia in the center-right, we do not understand instead what the self-definitions are of placing ourselves geometrically somewhere. We believe that the center corresponds to a representation that is not geographical, but of values, so we wait for the evolutions that will have to happen, but we believe we should send back to the sender observations that are purely instrumental and that also try to fuel political discord within the center-right. The center-right is a project, which is at an advanced stage because we are working together, it is nice that the League has also had a path of maturation because at the time of the DEFR the initiative we presented on compensation had not been supported, today instead it has shared this spirit, therefore it will no longer be only us of Forza Italia to represent this need of the Aosta Valley people but the number of sharing in the chamber will grow. For our part, the construction site is an advanced construction site, it is not a construction site still in the planning or design phase, therefore, to those who allow themselves to make evaluations inside the house of others, we wish to have the same success, to be able to put together the energies and forces that presuppose being able to put together."

47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,12,2940,"I will answer in this first line, and then leave room for my colleague Grosjacques regarding the more technical aspects relating to compensation from the State. I will answer you in a very simple way. Perhaps, driven by this political positioning, some aspect of the Legislative Decree has been lost that should have been analyzed in a more in-depth manner, as other colleagues have done and have tried to bring back to the Chamber. The first article, which is an article that goes to finance law 5, is an article that will guarantee compensation to those who have suffered damage in the territory. The procedure of law 5, the 3,900,000 euros of resources; it seems to me that article 1 will finance what will be the requests that have been put forward, moreover without the indication of an Ateco code or anything else, because law 5 does not provide for this type of development. Precisely in the context of what you say, these resources are made available to cover companies that will not be affected by the national decree, since, just to add one element, those who will join the national contribution will not have to have other subsidies, from other bodies or other public resources, to complete it. It goes without saying that the answer to your question is already within the Legislative Decree, that is, those resources there - which then are not sufficient or there are too many and which will have to be remodeled, increased, evaluated in a possible future bill... -, are already present and are there specifically to provide a response of reimbursement of up to 70% for those companies that have suffered material damage; those that will clearly be excluded and will not be contemplated within the national path that provides for the 15 million in reimbursements for the material damage suffered (therefore all those situations that will need to be reimbursed for the interventions that they had to do) will find an answer within law 5 with this first allocation that, if it is not sufficient, will be implemented, but which will guarantee a 70% reimbursement. This is the path that had already been adopted in 2000 with the flood, which provided coverage for the damages transversally suffered on the territory and which, also in this circumstance, with a speeding up, if we want, also of the law, because the law itself - I said it before but perhaps it escaped - should see, before being able to draw up the beneficiaries, the closure of the emergency path, which instead in this case is bypassed and, downstream of what will be the resources made available by the State, will see the formalization of who will be able to access the regional benefits; these are resources that are already available right away and will be made available to those people who have not had compensation at a national level. From this point of view, therefore, I feel authorized to say that the availability is already there and is already acknowledged within this bill."

47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,14,1214,"Mr President, perhaps we have a misunderstanding, Article 1 covers direct material damage, the decree of the Ministry of Tourism also covers indirect damage and we are talking about this, so I don't know if we can't understand. It's very simple, you tell us something to divert the reasoning. The discussion is only and exclusively on indirect damages which are called lost profits, because material damages are one thing and Article 1 does not include indirect damages. So I am telling you that there is unfair behavior on the part of the public administration in its relations with economic operators, because there are economic operators who will receive compensation for direct and indirect damages and there are economic operators who, because the Region does not put money into indirect damages, will only receive recognition for direct damages. We must not sit here and kid ourselves, because this is the truth, because misunderstanding this means kidding ourselves, because the order of the day, to put it very clearly, has this objective, to recognize the indirect damages, what the associations to which you did not want to give answers are asking. Everything else is nonsense."

In the meantime, as a premise, you will not lead us to say that the Ministry and the Government have not done their part, also because I would like to thank the structures of the Ministry for what they have done and above all for the discussions we have had, which have been continuous and constant; however, I believe it is important to summarize some passages, because you conclude the agenda by saying to prepare a compensation measure to cover the Ateco codes not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. Then I will get to, making the excursus, telling you that those who were kept out were not kept out because they were not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, but were kept out for a choice related to resources, as stated by the general director. In your questions, you ask if the perimeter of the Ateco codes of the decree was known. We began our discussions, starting from the day after the visit of Minister Santanchè on July 2; the minister (and this is worth underlining, even if the President has already made a point on this) following the commitment of the 10 million - which then became 10 for two Regions and then became 15 due to the discussions between the Valle d'Aosta Region and the Piedmont Region and the Minister himself - had categorically excluded compensation for lost profits. The decree should have only and exclusively concerned material damages and this emerges from a whole series of correspondence between the structures of the Department and the Ministry. The Ministry, following the video conference of September 10, where the issues related to the contents of the decree were explored in depth, had sent a list of Ateco codes to identify the economic activities to which the ministerial resources could be allocated. In this email, for example, other sports activities were included: at our express request we had reported some structures and infrastructures, first and foremost the Breuil Golf Club, which had been seriously damaged by the flood and which were initially included in the email from the Ministry. We had not found the Ateco code 56.30 which concerned bars and we, as for other categories, wrote on several occasions asking to include these categories too because they had been damaged, and they are not outside the jurisdiction, because outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Tourism were commercial activities on which we did work that did not lead to the same results, unfortunately, with the Ministry of Made in Italy businesses. The Ministry had included, contrary to the first draft, also a series of activities expressly requested by us, such as the rental of sports equipment, which we know has suffered considerable damage in Breuil Cervinia, and ski schools; the decree was not submitted to us in draft form because - the explanation, I believe legitimate, of the Ministry was this - since it had been sent to the Ministry of Economy and the Court of Auditors for the relevant approval, it could have been subject to comments that would have subsequently given rise to changes - therefore the Region never saw the draft of the decree, except after its definitive publication on November 11, as you recalled. As regards the nature of the compensation, in the video conference held on October 16 in the presence of the Minister and Councilor Chiarelli (my counterpart, for the Piedmont Region), the Minister expressly asked to allow the allocation of resources for compensation for lost profits, since the Municipalities included in the Civil Protection ordinance of the Piedmont Region would have practically not had any type of compensation since no material damage had occurred, except in some specific situations. We therefore agreed and gave our consent so that the Minister could, on the basis of the agreement between the two Regions, follow up on the signing and subsequent publication of the decree. English: As regards the competence of the Ministry's matters, here some assessments were made saying: ""You asked for things that were not within the competence""; it is not true, because, if you read - as I imagine you did - carefully the Ateco codes, you found canteens or itinerant pastry shops or in any case restaurants, therefore catering activities, activities that are usually managed by the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, therefore this decree could have easily included bars as well. I say this because in the video conference of November 15, therefore last Friday, in the presence - I want to underline this - of all the business categories included in the decree, the general director of productive activities of the Ministry, at the express request - and I add that at the request of the Ministry the video conference that lasted an hour and a half was recorded, therefore you will certainly be able to obtain it through your channels - said that bars were excluded due to a ministerial choice linked to the available resources, so I believe that from this point of view all the work that needed to be done has been done. The traders were absolutely taken into consideration, because the undersigned had several discussions with the Chief of Cabinet of Minister Urso, but the only measure available to the Ministry of Enterprise was the one related to the reduction of rates for those who wanted a measure similar to the one that was set up in the budget variation: the Mediocredito centrale would have reduced the rates, but there was no type of compensation provided by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy. This is to say that we also carefully followed those who we knew would be excluded from this decree. I am closing because I have no more time but I would like to say, colleague, that you have highlighted a whole series of passages, but it seems to me that your activity, despite being government forces at a national level, is a bit like chasing after things that have already come out rather than having - and you have - the possibility of interacting, because I have heard you say on several occasions that you have telephone contacts with all the Ministers of this Government, you have said it on several occasions, so what I want to underline is that you could have intervened heavily on this decree, instead we did everything that had to be done and to hear today from national government forces that the decree is lacking and above all to hear that there are activities that have not been included..."

From what we understand, everything possible has been done by the Ministry to make the group of beneficiaries as broad as possible, so we have a different result than what you announced, that is, that it was possible, in your opinion, to extend the benefit to some categories that are excluded in the category of economic operators; as far as we are concerned, we believe we are satisfied with the work that has been done at central level, we recognise it, we were pleased that you also recognised that there has been good collaboration, but it is precisely for this reason that we believed and believe, as I said earlier, that, in the context of a collaboration between bodies, between different institutional levels, when an approach is established, the measures at our regional level are integrated and made complementary.

Probably some piece was lost when, in the discussion on the DEFR, all the opposition groups remembered that it had been somewhat agreed to wait for the articles, therefore to be able to examine the articles, to then be able to formulate their own position. So we did, as we had agreed, we waited to see what the articles were and obviously I will not hide the surprise of having seen the articles that should have been the emergency one loaded with a whole series of articles that concerned the universe of the world; so in something that we expected to be exclusively dedicated to the flood, instead, it is loaded with a bit of everything, but once we saw what was expected and once we also examined and listened to the opinion of the stakeholders, which we had highlighted we would have been happy to hear in the Commission, but it was not possible by virtue of the censorship applied by the President of the II Commission on the mandate obviously of the President of the Region, so in the face of this censorship, we have matured our position which was already rather clear, but we have had a confirmation.

I think that the debate we have heard has been useful, although the information at our disposal is certainly partial, it is not at the level of either the Assessor or colleague Marquis, so in spirit, as we wanted to give support to the agenda of our colleagues from the League, we will also vote on this agenda. However, I would like to make a clarification: I know that colleague Marquis is much more knowledgeable in geometry than I am, but politics is often algebra and not geometry. What I said this morning... actually, I also thank my colleague Baccega for having awarded me a title that I am not worthy of, but I thank him anyway, I tend to make a very simple consideration: I did not say that you were confused and I did not even say that the centre-right is confused, I said that I was the one who was confused, because finding myself with two orders of the day, however with a non-trivial peculiarity, because I have to tell you the truth, colleague Marquis, while the order of the day of my colleagues from the League keeps the meshes open for every possible eventual application to include those who have been forgotten, you make two passages that, in my opinion, have generated confusion. On the one hand, essentially, it asks to intervene where - and, I repeat, I agree with Councillor Grosjacques - the Ministry, or in any case the Government that you support at the Roman level, has not intervened and therefore I say to myself: ""Why don't you carry out an operation of moral suasion to try to find not so much the issue of money but the ways to be able to intervene anyway?"", because the choice in any case depends mainly on Rome rather than Aosta; on the other hand, objectively, I expected only one order of the day, given that this choice was made in this place, because - I'm referring to what my colleague Manfrin said - in the previous place I remember very well that under the DEFR, rightly, all the opposition forces, without the need to connect them with red, blue or green wires, were essentially a little taken aback by the presentation of your order of the day, for one reason: in that place there was still a communion of intent, and we know that the term communion is complex, because everyone has to agree, and there we found ourselves a little taken aback. In this place therefore - it's my confusion, I repeat, you will surely have clear ideas - like a battleship you are heading towards the Dardanelles and I am happy for you, but the confusion was mine, because if I had to choose who to support, in the end I have to understand if they are saying the same thing, if they are saying two different things. The support is a support on principle, on will, also on effort, but objectively, from what I heard from the Councilor, the commitment is perhaps not entirely... or in any case what happened, or rather, even some premise, perhaps it is not entirely consistent with the path but, I repeat, we have information that is certainly partial, so it is you who must then give an explanation of what happened, and I say ""You"" in a broad sense. I did not call others confused, I was the confused one, because when you find these orders of the day, you rightly say: ""Let me understand what the position is"", considering that à maintes reprises, as I said, it is said that you are united for better or for worse, and no one wants to divide you, for goodness sake, you already do enough on your own in some things. Having said that, I repeat, in principle we will vote for it even if, in light of what we have heard, there are many doubts."

I would also like to make some considerations in light of the President's reply, because when he highlights that he agrees with or appreciates the report by Councillor Aggravi... I would like to highlight that in that report there are all the points of agreement that have been expressed by all the other group leaders, therefore a lack of agreement on the measure, the hearings denied in the Commission, the resources covered by national funds, the inclusion of articles that had no relevance to the emergency and even, with respect to the question of the Secretaries, the Councillor himself also referred to the considerations that I brought up during the general discussion to say that he fully agreed with what I had said. This time too I don't understand if it is linked to the way in which the various thoughts are expressed or if it is linked to the variable geometries that we hear so much about these days. Honestly, from this point of view, as the President has announced to us, surely the document that we will vote on in the next Regional Council will perhaps define the framework even better, but I repeat that I will go back and review what was said, but having also shared his minority report with my colleague, I can say that in some way I shared his and he shared mine, because the things we said are the same. As I was saying, it's a shame, we could have had a unanimous vote, most likely on those articles that concerned the emergency. That was not what they wanted to do and therefore we will abstain."

From these discussions, some observations were born that we had the opportunity to present to the III Council Commission, heard by President Chatrian in the III Commission on 19 December 2023 and after this hearing, we proceeded with notification no. 4 to the European Commission. This notification was then approved by the European Community with its own decision on 30 September 2024 and therefore today we find ourselves having to actually ratify the modification of this CSR based on the discussions that we have already had throughout the year. In addition, with respect to the changes that we agreed upon and discussed in December with the Council Commission, we have a 1% reduction in the FEASR quota - established in agreement with the Ministry, to provide a response of solidarity with respect to the floods that have hit the agricultural sector in Emilia Romagna in particular - and an increase in organic premiums of 10 euros on meadows and 5 euros on pastures to also include certification costs. This was a request that the trade associations and representatives had made: ""Include certification costs in the costs""; it was decided, through all discussions, to increase the quotas by these euros (precisely to provide this type of response) and to actually include certification costs."

It is the new reference of the common agricultural policy, a set of rules to support the agricultural and forestry sectors for rural areas, it is the founding reference in Italy to the national strategic plan, shared with all the Regions, the resources are for us about 92 million for the 5 years, with State-Region and ERDF shares. It contains all the forms of support, in particular those related to disadvantaged areas, to the compensatory payment for Natura 2000 agricultural areas and for animal welfare, for us very important and necessary compared to other realities of the Po Valley. With today's approval, real support is implemented for the agricultural world - certainly not easy to apply, we are clearly convinced of this - but which requires a temporal application effort that requires understanding the system and changes to the management of companies, changes that are not always immediate and adaptable, but these new formulas indicate new paths for production and less impactful management, with choices aimed at organic, in particular with forage production. A great deal of work has been done by the trade association, by freelancers, by the offices of the Department and by the Aosta Valley Area, to make companies adopt the binding changes, thinking about the new systems of agricultural production and management. We once had privileged environmental conditions on our side and today, year after year, we must be able to grasp the changes and constantly shape the entrepreneurial management of the climate and the trend of the market, not only local. The future hope for the sector is a conscious adhesion, already started with the knowledge of the detailed conditions, but not impossible; they are opportunities proposed as in the past, with constant and punctual payments, hoping that the Aosta Valley is always among the first places and, if not in first place, as has happened in the past, for the advancement of the expenditure of regular and punctual payments, with the collection of the measures, the hope is for everyone by the end of the year. For the companies, who have earned it, a Christmas bonus, not indifferent for the payments of rent, staff and mortgages with installments due. Furthermore, it is worth remembering once again the commitment made by the primary actors, namely the Department, with its structures and offices, the Area and the Agea, the trade associations, the cooperative system and, finally, the individual business owners or entrepreneurs, ready and aware in seizing the opportunities of the complement to be approved today.

I hope that with this document we will meet all these requests that have been brought forward by the territory. We, as a group of Rassemblement Valdôtain, had already, reluctantly, abstained last March from approving this document, because in our opinion it did not provide concrete answers especially for these small realities, for many small realities that today maintain the territory without taking into account the economic aspect, but only for pure maintenance and tradition of the territory, with the aim of having a panorama not only agricultural, but also for the tourist aspect, that gives a different impression because, as we all know, having a well-kept territory is very important also for the tourist aspect, and I do not need to underline this. What can I say? We really learn and we hope with good luck, that this document provides an answer to the territory, to the small realities and so on. As we abstained with the other document, we will abstain, but we will work constructively to be able to provide greater resources in every sense, to be able to have a document and give answers to the territory that really go to see those small realities that today are often forgotten, but that give a very important contribution to the maintenance of the territory, to combat fires, floods and everything else that unfortunately today the European directives - they are very good, they are very important and they are basic - perhaps, with a territory like ours, when it comes to agriculture, do not affect enough with regards to the aspects of our territory. I hope that with law 17 and with other measures we will intervene in favor of these to ensure that we give more detailed and more targeted answers possibly to all these particularities, so that they continue to maintain our territory as it has always been maintained, as we inherited it from our ancestors."

47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,16752,"This bill deals with urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities. The Aosta Valley is considered a mountain region in its entirety; on the maps we study at school the percentage of mountains is 100%. We, if we are objective, and above all grown up compared to when we went to school, do not consider this aspect true, or at least not in its entirety. There are municipalities, or at least parts of them, that to define as mountainous is a real insult to those who really know what the mountains are and live there all year round. We must be the first to stop defining ourselves entirely as mountainous if we want to give justice to those who really live in the mountains. Depopulation affects almost everyone in the Aosta Valley, except the municipalities of the Plaine, where instead there is a general increase in population. But the difference, and this is the meaning of the law, is that the depopulation that affects small municipalities puts their existence at risk. Losing 100 people in Châtillon is certainly serious, losing 10 in Rhêmes-Notre-Dame is much more serious. Social and economic life is at stake, volunteering is at stake - just think of the Pro Loco, the volunteer firefighters, the Alpini - and politics is at stake, now we always see the same people running for office, if indeed these people are still found. And I want to emphasize this: Municipalities that today no longer have a sufficient critical mass of population to guarantee a life for the community are Municipalities destined to have no future, they are destined to die, because that is what it is about, and how can even a young person invest in a Municipality that has no future? We often make the mistake of looking at the increase and decrease in population in the last ten years alone, obviously these data must be taken into account, but above all we must analyze the trend in recent decades. Emile Chanoux already said in the 1920s: ""I am originally from a country in the Aosta Valley where the depopulation is the most devastating. I can see the powerful sadness of this old country"". In fact, it is from the Unification of Italy that the depopulation of many of our small municipalities and of many upper hamlets of large municipalities began, the data from the various censuses demonstrate this and these are easily found on the Istat website. If we analyze this trend in recent decades, the numbers are merciless, let's take some examples, precisely, starting from the Unification of Italy. In 1861 Allein had 770 inhabitants, now 207; Chamois 322, now 107; Emarèse 495, now 217; Etroubles 1,032, now 478; La Magdeleine 386, now 100; Pontboset 708, now 174; Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 777, now 164; Valsavarenche 639, now 161. These are just a few examples. A phenomenon, as I said, that has distant roots; not simple solutions, but those proposed in the law could be some of these. This proposal in fact addresses one of the aspects that could reverse the phenomenon of depopulation: the fact that living in the mountains costs more and therefore contributions are necessary, and above all tax relief. A proposal that has never claimed to be the solution to the problem, but a proposal that must be, together with others, one of the pieces of the puzzle, a proposal that can allow those who live in the mountains to stay there and those who want to return. Someone might argue that rather than benefits for individuals and families, we need to guarantee services - and I totally agree - but guaranteeing services must go hand in hand with direct economic aid to families and those who want to invest in these small territories. Without people, services cannot be guaranteed, without services, the presence of people cannot be guaranteed. These two issues must go hand in hand. The current results of depopulation demonstrate two aspects: either that the measures adopted to date are not sufficient or that these measures are wrong, because otherwise we would not be here talking about a law against depopulation. At the heart of this proposal is also the cultural aspect, an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is in fact an Aosta Valley in which autonomy no longer makes sense, because this land would become, like many other territories, without specificity; an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is an ""Italian Aosta Valley in all respects"" and we must resist this in any way, in the name of those who wanted the specificity we enjoy today. And here is the linguistic, cultural aspect, of symbiosis with the high lands to be reinvigorated: it is in fact foreseen, for those who decide to return to live in the mountain municipalities, the need to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language and culture, Titsch and Töitschu and Walser culture in the Walser municipalities, as well as a communication campaign of the measures of the law in the French-speaking states and in the German-speaking states only for the Walser communities, because the objective would be to attract new inhabitants from other states, with the aim of changing their lives. And, if you will notice, in the financial coverage of article 4, for the contribution for new residents, the Chéque Montagnard, the amount is absolutely prudential and in perspective, as it is truly a lifestyle choice that requires time in the decision. A real, concrete, improvable proposal, as I have said from day one. A non-trivial articulated that I will now explore in greater depth. Article 1, paragraph 1, states the purpose and object of this proposed law, recalls Articles 31, 37, first paragraph, and 44, second paragraph, of the Constitution. In order to counteract the demographic decline of small mountain municipalities, a measure for the birth rate and a contribution for the inclusion of new residents in small mountain municipalities is promoted, enhancing the linguistic and cultural particularism of local communities. Paragraph 2 guarantees an exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge in order to provide support to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. Article 2, paragraph 1, defines which are small mountain municipalities, i.e. those that on 31 December 2023 have a population of less than 800 inhabitants and where the seat of their municipality is above 650 meters above sea level. Paragraph 2 establishes that the Regional Council, within thirty days of the entry into force of the law, approves the list of municipalities that present the characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 and updates it every three years. Some clarifications are necessary: ​​it is quite clear that finding an objective classification is practically impossible, because there are truly so many aspects that define what a mountain is and what a small municipality is. However, the two indicators identified seemed to be the best for including small, mountainous and not strictly tourist municipalities. In the initial reasoning for the law, the objective was also to include the mountain villages of large municipalities, which must absolutely not be second-rate and which, in many cases, are in the same conditions as small municipalities identified by the law. However, after a passage from Dr. Ceccarelli, head of the Economic and Social Observatory, it emerged that to date there are no disaggregated data on residents by fraction in the hands of the Region, so to date it is impossible to quantify any possible burden deriving from the application of the measures of the law in parts of municipalities, but it is obvious that, in perspective, this data will have to be there and, if there were a law, there will have to be this implementation. Article 3, paragraph 1, establishes the Chèque Valdôtain birth allowance, as a measure aimed at encouraging an increase in births and the valorization of parenthood in small mountain municipalities. Paragraph 2 highlights that the allowance is paid for twelve months, up to a maximum of 5 thousand euros per year in favor of families at the time of the birth of a child and until the child reaches the age of three, or the entry into the family of a minor, through adoption or foster care, up to the age of three. It is then expected that the beneficiaries of the birth allowance are parents residing in a small mountain municipality of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, or who transfer their residence to one of the said municipalities and who receive a total income determined for the purposes of personal income tax of up to 50 thousand euros. A sum that is certainly not trivial, but which serves to provide assistance to the middle class, not only to the less well-off. Paragraph 4 emphasizes that residence in the small mountain municipality must be maintained for at least ten years, under penalty of forfeiture of the birth allowance and the return of the sums received. Ten years is not a trivial number at all, but it is precisely because it is necessary in the basic seriousness to undertake this type of life choice that this number was chosen. Article 4, paragraph 1, establishes an incentive for new residents in small mountain municipalities, the Chèque Montagnard. A financial contribution for three years equal to 5 thousand euros per year is provided for families who transfer their residence to a small mountain municipality in the Region and maintain it for at least 10 years. Paragraph 2 includes the requirements that the members of the family unit must possess: be Italian citizens or citizens of a member state of the European Union, or stateless or foreigners with a regular residence permit; earn a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and at least two members of the family unit must be under 70 years of age on the date of requesting the contribution, because in any case it would not make sense to encourage the arrival of pensioners who could certainly give less value to small municipalities in the future. Paragraph 3 states that, for those who already reside in the regional territory, in order to move and have access to the contribution, the municipality of origin must have a population of no less than 3 thousand inhabitants on 31 December 2023, because obviously residents must not be stolen from each other between small municipalities or municipalities of not so large dimensions within the Valley. Paragraph 4 establishes that in order to access the contribution, the requesting family unit must declare and demonstrate that the property located in the municipality of new residence (whether owned or deriving from a loan for use rental agreement or other equivalent title) is intended to be the habitual residence for the entire period of enjoyment of the benefit. Paragraph 5 emphasizes that the amount of the contribution referred to in Paragraph 1 is doubled if the requesting family units start a business activity in the small mountain municipality of their new residence, including through the recovery of real estate assets of the historical and artistic heritage, while paragraph 6 emphasizes that the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 can be combined with the birth allowance referred to in Article 3. The cultural and linguistic aspect, with a view to integration into the local community, is central in paragraph 7, in fact, for the purposes of obtaining the contribution, all members of the family unit aged between 7 and 69 years of age, who are not affected by disabilities, pursuant to the provisions in force, must attend, within the first two years of transferring their residence to a small mountain municipality, a course in Franco-Provençal and Franco-Provençal culture, in Töitschu and Titsch of Walser culture in the Municipality of Issime/Eischeme and Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. Paragraph 8 specifies that the Regional Council, within 60 days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, identifies the methods of organizing the course of that paragraph 7, including the bodies and associations authorized to teach. It is essential on the one hand to integrate and on the other to strongly stimulate the population that already resides in a small municipality of the importance of their languages ​​and cultures. Article 5, paragraph 1, establishes that the Regional Council, within sixty days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, regulates the criteria and methods of assigning the birth allowance with article 3 and the contribution referred to in article 4, as well as in agreement with the CPEL, the competences regarding the related controls. Paragraph 2 emphasizes how local authorities have the possibility of integrating with their own resources the amount of the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article four, while paragraph 3 highlights that the CPEL and the small mountain municipalities ensure the support activity to promote the dissemination of information regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4. Paragraph 4 deals with the communication aspect, in fact the Region, also through its instrumental bodies, must promote a communication campaign regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4 in the French- and German-speaking states of the European Union. The communication campaign in the German-speaking states is aimed at encouraging the settlement of new German-speaking families only in the Walser municipalities of Issime/Eischeme, Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. All this is absolutely fundamental to always maintain a living identity from a cultural point of view and above all a specificity, in particular, towards the Walser Municipalities. Article 6 deals with a measure conceived to give help to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. A first step towards a great objective, a greater tax relief for those who live in the mountains and who evidently have additional costs that must be counterbalanced. In paragraph 1, in fact, for the tax period 2024/2025/2026, even if the measure would then become structural, subjects with a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and who live in small mountain municipalities, are exempt from paying the regional IRPEF surcharge. For the first time, I believe, the issue of tax relief in some areas, only in some areas, which have higher costs, is addressed in a systematic way. A path, I believe, that should be followed. Article 7 inserts the evaluation clause, while article 8 defines the financial provisions. Here, I will dwell for a moment on the financial provisions, because those who have studied the law in depth will have wondered why they are so long. Based on the data received by Dr. Nuvolari at the end of February 2024, relating to the money allocated but not yet committed to the various missions and programs, in-depth work has been carried out to find the coverage. A law concerning local authorities - someone suggested to me - should have been based on the resources of current transfers to local authorities. Well, I was totally opposed to this, because local authorities are not rolling in gold and because, if the law were approved, in perspective a whole series of services would have to continue to be maintained or services would have to be implemented, so cutting funds from current transfers to local authorities would have been wrong. An attempt was then made to find funds by touching various missions in the least impactful way possible, with the aim of avoiding people saying: ""With this law, however, funds for health, education, public works are being cut"" and so on. I hope this effort was appreciated, the effort of not making banal, simplistic arguments about finding resources, in order only to make the numbers add up, but an in-depth study that would allow an attempt to find funds that were as fair and as little impactful as possible. Then, indeed, there was the political will to move forward... the resources could easily have been found in other missions and other programs. The opinion on the financial coverage of the law, given on October 7, was negative but then again what could one expect after the law was discussed seven months after the appointment of the rapporteur on April 11? It is therefore obvious that the resources had already been spent. This was, in short, the proposed law. I thank my colleagues from the League for their support, the offices that have done a truly important job and also the majority Councilors who, by voting against this law in the Commission, allowed its discussion in the Chamber."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,3,318,"The bill has been explained. Before opening the general discussion, I would like to inform you that today Councilor Ganis has communicated the withdrawal of his signature from the bill. Let's open the general discussion, the general discussion is open. Councilor Restano has booked, he has the right to do so."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,4,4696,"I speak on behalf of the Rassemblement Valdôtain group. We waited with a certain curiosity for the debate in the Commission on the text of the law proposed by our colleagues from the League to understand what the majority's position was and above all to understand if there were any developments regarding the proposed rule and its articulation. Why do I say this? Because we have worked on the subject, so much so that we had also presented an inspection initiative and we expressed doubts in the Commission that led to abstention, doubts regarding the possibility of applying this rule and above all the opportunity to coordinate it with a text of state law that was presented precisely by Rassemblement Valdôtain and amended in the first Commission, producing a Commission text. We learned today of the absence of amendments, perhaps in light of how the majority positioned itself in the Commission, which expressed a negative vote. From our point of view, this rule - which we appreciate, because we appreciate the effort and the will of our colleagues from the League - could have been more ambitious, much more ambitious, it could have foreseen a connection, as we said, with the rule that provides for the establishment of mountain free zones, it could also in light of what the rapporteur said in a correct and honest manner ... it did not have the ambition of being a solution to the problem and it addresses one of the aspects that could, together with many others, produce a reversal or facilitate a reversal of depopulation. It is clear that, compared to the data that our colleague has proposed to us, depopulation in recent decades and even much more has been significant, we limit ourselves to looking at the trend of recent years, as he said, and this is already significant. The habits of the people of the Aosta Valley have changed, their lifestyles, their ambitions, the way of undertaking the mountains have changed, but we have doubts about the definitions, the proposed definition and it is difficult to apply, ""Above 650 meters, with a certain population below"", however, as has already been said, the entire Aosta Valley is considered a mountain area. There are differences, but can we say that a municipality below 600 meters, which however experiences a phenomenon of significant hydrogeological instability, a marked economic backwardness, is not worthy of using this rule? Can we say that a municipality at 500 meters - with objective difficulties regarding tourist flows, the promotion of the territory - is not worthy of using this rule? It is very difficult. It is very difficult to say who may be inside, included in the rule or not, but above all what we believe is appropriate to verify and do is to coordinate the new text, such as the one proposed by colleagues, with the existing texts, with what is already being implemented in the mountains, and this is an important thing. We mainly value the productive aspect, how can we say that agriculture is not important in the mountains? This text does not talk about agriculture, perhaps because it is already included in other texts, but, in certain mountain areas, it is important to value agriculture, it is important to exempt from taxes as proposed by colleagues, but the rule on the mountain free zone that we proposed also concerns other types of taxes, it concerns IRAP, it would be important to coordinate it with this rule. We see, in this proposal, an interesting proposal, but one that must necessarily evolve. Our group is working on measures to propose, we have also worked on a text to propose, we were waiting for today's discussion, we are waiting for the budget, we are checking what may be cooking in the pot, we are maintaining a high level of attention on this rule, on this topic, as I think colleagues from all political forces do, including the Government. We believe a rule is necessary, there are other Regions that have already done so, I am talking about at least six Regions: Veneto, Trentino, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Piedmont and Lombardy. We believe that the Aosta Valley must produce an important text on the topic, it must not leave anyone behind, but above all it must allow us to highlight, to bring to the attention of the Regional Council all the particularities of our region, which do not depend on population density and quota, but must consider other problems, other particularities. The colleague will express his opinion regarding the group's vote, I leave these considerations to the Council, believing that I have given the opportunity to reason, especially with a view to the future, on what we can perhaps do together."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,5,33,Councilor Jordan has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Jordan,Corrado,1973.0,M,UV,6,4762,"In addition to what has been said, we believe that it is necessary for the Regional Council to work on these measures, to promote living in the mountains, to promote our Municipalities, the Municipalities of the region that can be considered, as has already been said, marginal. The demographic crisis, depopulation and the closure of businesses are all elements that unfortunately involve many Municipalities, therefore situations that must be addressed, as far as possible, with the tools at our disposal, in a strategic vision, with so-called structural policies of longer duration and not with spot or limited interventions. Fighting depopulation in small mountain Municipalities necessarily requires an overall integrated approach, which therefore integrates regional policies with state policies and which considers the needs of local communities and the potential of the territory. I do not believe that there is a miracle recipe to resolve a trend that has multiple causes and that is objectively much more complex than can be highlighted today in this debate. English: I find and we find the proposal presented by colleague Lavy interesting, if only for having made some operational proposals available to everyone, proposals that however must be part of a virtuous process of actions, including bonuses, as foreseen, can be useful, but cannot be considered as structural and systematic actions. Actions that, although complex, can certainly prove more effective. I believe that it is necessary and appropriate that this comparison be in-depth and integrated with the proposals that were illustrated here in the Commission, on the occasion of the discussion on the application of the free zone, but also, and I add, all the initiatives that, in the institutional sphere, but also external to the institutions, I refer to the University, to the system of trade union organizations, must be put into common factor: all initiatives that in some way can contribute to helping us find the right recipe. And I also add that it is necessary to inevitably refer to the law on the mountains, currently under discussion in Parliament, and to the interesting initiatives that this law could also introduce for our territory. Only in this way, only later, now it is premature, could we have a complete picture of the opportunities that could be put in place and that should, as I said before, be integrated with the many actions already present in our region, we must not forget it, actions that favor small municipalities. I am thinking of education, the reality of subsidized schools, but also of the policies on the facilities of small ski resorts, the great equalization in a federalist perspective of regional transfers that see important resources to the smallest municipalities and, again, social policies, which beyond the difficulties that are evident, are important and if we look at the other regions we do not find them so active. As a contribution to the discussion, I indicate some actions that could be the object of an overall analysis that, in part, are already implemented and are effective, but in some cases could be further developed. It is clear that it would be important to be able to include tax breaks for individuals and legal entities, we talked about it in previous interventions - and the regional surtax is not enough, it would be necessary to do more, but the matter is a state competence, as my colleague Lavy said, and it needs to be explored - or with actions related to taxes and duties on housing, but here there is a significant problem of financial coverage. We must promote coworking spaces and improved connections, internet connectivity in marginal areas must be distributed, this is to promote smart working, support remote working for residents or for owners of second homes. We must further promote the improvement of the quality of life in relation to essential services in healthcare, with territorial structures and with telemedicine, I might add. We must further incentivize policies for the renovation of unused properties, as well as imagine policies to support housing in these areas, or even territorial marketing campaigns, to attract new residents and new tourists, focusing on an image of quality of life linked to the mountains and nature. Finally, and I am aware that I have not made an exhaustive analysis, collaborations between local authorities are useful, indeed necessary, in order to define inter-municipal networks of services to share resources and develop common projects."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,7,35,"Councilor Minelli, you have the authority."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,8,4731,"We have already read the proposal of our colleagues from the League some time ago and we have also listened with interest to the report by our colleague Lavy, a report in which, even in the text accompanying the law, we appreciated the in-depth analysis that was made of the situation that concerns many Municipalities in our region. It is an in-depth, timely analysis, we can see that there is work behind it, even serious work of in-depth analysis, and we recognize that there has been an effort on your part in presenting this proposed law, in which we see, however, some elements of weakness that raise, also on our part, doubts. The first concerns precisely the identification of the Municipalities that are included in the list of those that would benefit from the proposed measures, and - as our colleague Lavy also explained - a synthesis has been found between the parameters relating to the number of inhabitants less than 800 units and the location of the town hall above 650 meters. This leads to having, in this list, Municipalities that are extremely different and that can hardly even be considered with regard to the critical issues, the risks, the economic situation. I'll give you an example: the situation between Pontboset and Torgnon is certainly different, because we know very well - and the population data that my colleague Lavy cited also say so - that it is not so much a question of inhabitants, but of the development or non-development situation that leads these two realities - I'll give you just this example - to be very different. I live in one of the Municipalities that would be included in the list and I must say that there are some other doubts: my colleague Lavy also said that a system had to be found also with regard to concrete aid, therefore contributions, or the system of services. We believe that a bill that really intervenes and helps the realities of these Municipalities should focus, rather than a series of contributions, on the introduction or implementation, because it is not that there are no services, but the implementation of services. Then there is an aspect that we do not think is so easy to apply, for example the condition that must be respected to maintain what you have called Chèque Valdôtain and the other related to births, the Chèque Montagnard. It is said that the sine qua non condition is that the residence in the municipality where this contribution was obtained must be maintained for ten years. Now we know that there is a dynamic of population movements that is very strong; I am talking about the municipality where I live, which I know well: we have very fast population movements, people who come, children who attend school for a period and then move, and I do not believe that the possibility of having these 5 thousand euros for the birth of the child or for residence in the municipality, can constitute a strong attraction and a motivation to remain in that territory over time. As for Chèque Montagnard and Chèque Valdôtain, it is then said that it would be necessary for each new family unit that decides to move to one of the small mountain towns to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language or culture or Titsch or Töitschu language. I believe that it is already very difficult - I am thinking above all of people who come from distant countries, but not only - to create the conditions for there to be a possibility of daily communication, therefore of knowledge of the Italian or French language, and I think that learning our languages ​​and dialects must also be something linked to a desire for integration that some people have. I am referring to my reality, we have people who are of Romanian or Moroccan origin who speak patois very well, but it was not an imposition, they learned it by being with the population, creating bonds and also having a personal desire for integration, for knowledge of the territory. A course imposed on each family unit that would come to reside in these towns seems a bit forced to us. Same issue for the birth allowance, which is like the other. While appreciating the effort that has been made and sharing some of the assessments that have been made, because it is certainly a problem, the one we have of the depopulation of the mid-mountain, we think that perhaps the reflection should be broader, more articulated and focus on a range of services that must be guaranteed to those who have decided, voluntarily or involuntarily, to continue living in the mountains or to come and live in the mid-mountain, for which our vote will be a vote of abstention."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,9,38,"Councilor Chatrian, it's your turn."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Chatrian,Albert,1975.0,M,UV,10,7725,"I join in thanking you, colleague Lavy, for the work that has been done and allow me to reason a little on this bill, but above all on the architectural system proposed by the colleague. We must look at ourselves honestly, around this hall there is a completely different Valle d'Aosta compared to the numbers and steps that have been taken also in relation, so we absolutely must know our history, we absolutely must know our potential, and there is a lot of it, but we must also have the ability to accompany the process on our legislative level: what has been done, what is being done but above all what can or must still be done. There is certainly room, if today we are addressing this issue in this way it is because with regard to a whole series of measures, laws, support, with regard to identity and also culture, despite everything, we can say it - it is not a nice word perhaps - but we have held firm. If we look at our neighbor Piedmont, if we look at our neighbor Lombardy, their lateral valleys, I think we have been quite good, but probably we absolutely must have that ability to find other solutions. To find other supports - but I don't put the economic issue at the center, not the financial issue - I put the quality of life at the center. The proposed law is ""Urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities"", whether they are small, medium or somewhere in between doesn't matter. I think the most important challenge is to guarantee services 365 days a year, because then the risk - and I'm talking about where I live, where I absolutely know more - is that the high tourist lands are guaranteed all the services for nine months, but that in those other three months they are practically ghost towns. The medium tourist lands perhaps manage to guarantee a whole series of public or private services for 12 months, but with many difficulties, but then we have a medium mountain that perhaps - I remember the passage my colleague made before - suffers more than the others, because it doesn't have that tourist potential and, therefore, doesn't have, either in season or out of season, a whole series of services that the other two elements I highlighted have. In all of this, undoubtedly, I think the most delicate part is that linked to work-family balance. What is the goal to create those conditions so that families, new or not, decide to live and not survive in the high or medium mountains? It is to be able to reconcile work... I open a parenthesis: in the high lands there is a lot of it in the two seasons, I close the parenthesis. In the intermediate lands, therefore in the medium mountains, it is more delicate, but there we can work in a different way with transport and on this I open another parenthesis: it seems to me that the efforts that are being made as a public are truly important efforts, I highlight this knowing very well the efforts that the public is making but, despite everything, today, for a family that lives in a medium mountain, or in the high lands, and does not have a private means, I assure you that it is not easy, if the work is not on site, to reconcile family and work. I have given examples that we all know, but perhaps every now and then it is also important to repeat them and highlight them. Returning to the issue, I repeat, some ideas are interesting within this system, but they must then be accompanied... one has already been said by other colleagues: by the law of the mountain, which we hope will find at a political mountain level, by those who at least know these territories and these needs... and, on the other hand, by the implementing rule that will give us the possibility of going, why not, to regulate further with measures and with tools that are also innovative, also of an economic-financial nature, but I put them as a last resort, because perhaps the most important challenge on our more political level is to succeed in getting that message across related to the fact that it becomes an important lifestyle choice but different from the central axis of the main valley which is the one that goes from Pont-Saint-Martin to Courmayeur. In all this we cannot hide, colleague Lavy, perhaps you are a lover of numbers like me, but then, when you know the numbers, you have to find solutions to the critical issues. We have a declining demographics that is very strong, in 2012-2013-2014 the births in Valle d'Aosta were about 1,300, today the births in Valle d'Aosta in the last two years are about 700; it is a further element: despite all the efforts that we are making as an Autonomous Region, these are undoubtedly raw data, but that not only must make us reflect, but that must spur us to find further solutions. I end by saying that on this basis, on the fact - hopefully in the short term - that the law on mountains can be approved at a national level, that we can put together, in any case, all those measures that are currently included in various regional laws. We will be approving the 2025-2026 budget in a few weeks... the dignity that this majority, and I hope that other political forces will also approve those articles... we give certainties again to the system of local authorities; local authorities, municipalities, which guarantee a good part of the services in the territories, local authorities that provide those services above all you mentioned the small, medium or slightly larger municipalities of medium and high mountains. Without these tools, I think that today our lateral valleys would be similar to those of Piedmont and, alas, similar to those of Lombardy. You have reported very well within the report, taking us back to 1860-1870, when Magdeleine and Chamois had X inhabitants; I live in Torgnon and La Magdeleine has less than 100 inhabitants, Chamois does not reach 100 inhabitants, and Torgnon and Antey together barely reach 1,000 inhabitants. to give some examples. English: Earlier, my colleague Minelli, rightly, highlighted the difference between a Pontboset and a Torgnon, but I would not wage war on the poor and would try to find solutions to prevent people from surviving in the middle or high mountains, but to be able, instead, to succeed together in guaranteeing that quality of life - which in the end is our role, that of creating the best laws, legislating to achieve those specific objectives - so that people, families decide to make drastic choices, because, I assure you, by just putting together the main ones - services, transport, school, health, sport, aggregation policies, local authorities, work and work-life balance (I've listed eight) - if one stops only at the economic-financial issue, if there were all the measures that we as a Region put in place, I think that our valleys would be completely different. Despite this, we can probably make a further effort, a further push, it would be nice to be able to do it together, this can also be an interesting starting point, intertwining proposals that are also innovative, but, if I can give you some advice, colleague Lavy, let's put aside the exclusively fiscal, economic, financial issue, I assure you that the most important part is - in my opinion, our point of view also as a group - to be able to improve the quality of life of the people who choose to stay anyway, because many, often, love the mountains, Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, but living there 365 days is a lifestyle choice."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,11,33,Councilor Perron has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,12,2822,"I will intervene briefly, also taking up the last cue from colleague Chatrian. I will abstract myself from the fiscal issues, the more economic issues, because I think that this law, with the work that colleague Lavy has done, is a bit of an attempt - which I would also define as original and fully in line with a true autonomist spirit - to also create something new, that is, if we are here, in the end the highest role that we can have as Councilors is precisely that of legislators, therefore an attempt that, I repeat, I consider commendable precisely for this sense of novelty, of originality that is put on the table; also pioneering as an attempt, certainly - all pioneering attempts have their defects, that is, they can certainly have them, and here the colleagues who make notes on some particularities of the law, clearly have their reasons - but, I repeat, it is a pioneering attempt and in this way it should be evaluated. In my opinion, this bill demonstrates considerable interest, also because, in the background, in addition to economic and fiscal issues - on which colleagues are much more knowledgeable than I am, who am a terrifying accountant from that point of view - there are other underlying issues: for example, that of identity, which is a fundamental issue, and which in some way this law touches upon. If we ask ourselves today who the people of the Aosta Valley are, today, in 2024, how can we define the people of the Aosta Valley in 2024, when already starting from the last century, starting from fascism, we had the first waves of migration? Let's think of the Venetians, then let's think of the post-war period with Calabrian immigration, and today immigration from various parts of the world. In this law, therefore, there is an attempt - in my opinion, strong and intelligent - to propose solutions that can favor those who can and want to integrate in the Aosta Valley territory and be part of a community, a community that uses in this case the linguistic medium as a system to make participants, but that is put on the table. I understand the colleague who says: ""Making it mandatory becomes something of..."", but it is an attempt to create cohesion, create a community, on the basis that are our identity characteristics, because French, and perhaps even more Franco-Provençal, is something that we must not lose. In conclusion, practically everything has already been said in the colleague's report, I would like to point out that, with this attempt, our party demonstrates in a certain sense a vitality and a pioneering spirit to present laws that are also new and that, despite some defects, certainly go to signify, on our part, a desire to look beyond the horizons that have been used so far by those who have governed the region in recent years."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,13,31,Councilor Lavy has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,11486,"I thank my colleagues for the debate. I will proceed in order, to try to answer the various questions that have been put on the table, because I knew very well that in the end the tone of the answers would be this, a sort of whataboutism, the need to make a global provision, the need to reflect and that's fine, we go on for years, years and years reflecting, but we see the phenomenon, but, precisely, I will proceed in order, starting with the words of my colleague Restano, who asked if, in some way, this text could not be related to the one on mountain free zones, which we absolutely supported, because it is something interesting, but it has a limit: temporariness, so that if a mountain free zone is applied in a certain territory, it lasts a certain number of years and then the condition remains, it returns to the previous one, because the structural deficits of the territory remain. If you are half an hour away from Aosta, it's not that with the mountain free zone that time is reduced, it still leaves half an hour away, that's how it is; it's certainly very interesting, but the free zone has a temporary nature, so after a certain number of years those measures end. If you wanted to have collaboration, it was possible to do so, because the text on mountain free zones was promoted, I think, in July, if I remember correctly, and this law has been tabled since April, so if there had been the will to talk to each other, this was there. I noticed, and I already said it in the discussion of that law, that you took inspiration from this law, from article 6, the one on the exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge: you put it a little more generally, but this doesn't seem so much like collaboration to me but, more than anything else, and here for the proposed state law - it's certainly an interesting proposal - at least one article was copied a little. On the criteria, it is obvious and I said it first: the criteria are absolutely debatable, that is, who can define what is a mountain and what is not a mountain today? We made an attempt, but where is yours? Because it is easy to say: ""Well, these criteria, 800 inhabitants, 650 meters, are not good, we need to find others"", and what are these others? What are they? It is easy to say, right? Try to write down some and then let's think about it. The first day I arrived at the Commission I said: ""If you have any proposals, make them""; zero proposals, not even one, so don't say that the criteria are wrong, they are not entirely convincing, I am the first to say it, but if you had a better proposal you should have made it. I have not seen any proposals. My colleague Jordan said that this would be a law that has spot and limited interventions: I don't know if the text is clear, it seems so, these measures are structural, therefore, if this law were approved, the measures would last as long as one wants, both contributions and also the additional IRPEF exemption. I included the three-year period because I was forced to include it, because it is necessary to base the tax period on the three-year period, but that measure would also have been structural. Then I agree that the additional regional IRPEF exemption is not enough, I agree, but in the meantime let's start doing this if it is possible and if there is the will, given that there is so much talk about the mountains. As for the question of life choices, the 10 years, the fact of the Titsch and Töitschu Franco-Provençal course: a measure like that, bringing people to live in a context like the mountains, which is absolutely not simple, indeed, it is a serious life choice, very serious... so one knows that, if one decides to come and live in that territory and accesses the contributions, one must stay there for ten years. If one has doubts about not staying, one does not come, period, one does not come, one does not make that choice, one goes somewhere else, one goes to the city and does not make that choice or knows where it is, if one is happy. Same thing for the language course, one knows that one must do it, if one does not want to do it, that's it, one does not come, it is not a problem. This serves to integrate those who come, but also to give us a wake-up call, because we are the first ones not to speak our patois to our children, it is a dramatic thing, and then it is obvious that everything is lost. If the Valdostano is told: ""Look, there's that guy who arrived yesterday, who's taking a course in patois, do you speak it?"", ""No"", perhaps a little bit of pride can arise and they can say: ""No, we have to speak our languages ​​too, it's not like the guy who arrived yesterday has to speak them. Talking about services: the talk about services is absolutely central, but the two things have to go hand in hand. In the 80s (let's put it that way) did we have more or less services than today in the mountain areas? Probably more. We have bank branches - I will make a question regarding banking desertification and so on - but how many more schools did we have? Lots. If 40 years ago we had more services and today there are fewer, it means that services are not the condition for which people remain in the mountains at all costs - it is a very important condition but it is not the only one - so we must act on an aspect that is often not considered here: living in the mountains costs more, just think of the cost of heating, so if we do not meet the needs of those who live in certain areas and have higher costs, it is obvious that someone can decide to leave. Then, again, my colleague Chatrian, you said: ""If we are addressing this issue today, it is because we have held (you used this ugly term, you said it) compared to other regions"", and I totally agree, if we go and look at Piedmont, certain valleys are dramatically empty, there is no one left or almost no one. We are perhaps 20-30 years behind those valleys, if, in some way, today we do not take measures that can reverse the situation, that is the objective we will reach, because - you always said it, colleague Chatrian - demography is an exact science. Today we have so many births, in perspective we could have so many inhabitants, without considering those who then leave, and that is another matter. Surely the issue of services must be brought forward and surely this is a text that cannot be comprehensive, but if we want to wait for a comprehensive text, good luck, it will take us two centuries to put everything in. Let's start with a text... then the interesting thing, and President Testolin also said it in the Commission, when he came, he said: ""Do you have any doubts? On some issues, I am the first to have doubts""; and that is fine, but let's try experimentally to bring forward a law of that kind. Let's choose two-three Municipalities, which perhaps can also have different characteristics, and let's try in some way to experiment with these measures. After five years we will see the results, if there are no results, I am the first to say: ""No, this is the wrong path"", but if we don't even try, let's not come and say that this is something that maybe is useless. Let's try it experimentally, then we'll see, but here there is never the courage to do anything, so we sit on what we are already doing and in the meantime everything falls apart. Because here, talking about mountains, talking about high lands, talking about villages, there are not many, or rather, there are some who are mostly those who still live in these territories and, if we count those who come from more mountainous municipalities, we are no longer many, indeed, we are very, very few. Here, also in terms of future representation, it is obvious that in perspective those who come from the city, those who come from the Plaine, have an increasingly greater electoral and representative weight, therefore those who come from the mountains in the chamber will be fewer and fewer, because, I see, of my generation, there are very few people who live there and who then deal with politics, so in perspective we risk handing over the Aosta Valley - which some say is an entirely mountainous territory - to people who know nothing about mountains. This is an important aspect, therefore, either we do something now, even with strong, experimental measures, otherwise we raise the white flag, consider Piazza Chanoux a mountain, because someone will end up saying this, by now in certain parameters Aosta is considered entirely mountainous. For goodness sake, some hamlets yes, they are, but Aosta is not mountainous, I'm sorry. I will still reserve some considerations in the declaration of vote, perhaps, because we have many paradoxes. For example, we have a deputy from the Union Valdôtaine who proposes a motion in Parliament for the internal areas and the mountainous areas. All right, we are all capable of proposing motions, but then I would like to understand what he thinks of this proposed law, to understand if it could be interesting or not. The fact that I noticed, because obviously it is not that once I presented the proposed law I was there sleeping, I went around and went to 23 Municipalities, to 23 Mayors, who were in fact protagonists of this proposed law. Some of these, who then surprised me, were surprised by the fact that for the first time, in the span of their government of the Municipality, there was a Regional Councilor who went to visit them - something that sincerely left me amazed - and all these Mayors have nevertheless expressed great attention towards this law, really great attention, some more than others, for goodness sake, knowing full well that it was not decisive, but then we know that politics acts in certain systems and the CPEL above all acts, we see it: many mayors are the first to complain about depopulation, but then they do not vote for this law. Many mayors are there complaining about the fact that they have deserted centers and then vote against the moratorium that would block the birth of new commercial businesses, so zero coherence on the part of many mayors. But honor to those who instead with pride - because I was told that some did not flatten out, as many do - to an opinion of the CPEL proposed by some Mayors, in a very strong way, expressed themselves against that opinion of abstention of the CPEL, saying that this law could be a tool to combat the phenomenon of depopulation. Honor to these mayors who truly have courage, because we all know very well that not falling into line in certain circles, when there are certain proposals, is not at all simple. This was a complex bill, which touches on one of the aspects of the depopulation of the mountains, which I called a puzzle; this is a piece of the puzzle, and everyone said that it is made up of interesting measures. So I say to myself: but why not try it? Because either you tell a lie, saying that they are interesting measures and you do not consider them as such, or you fill your mouth with words and then, in practice, when there is something different, parallel to the discussion of services and so on, you do nothing. The doubt is that if this proposal had been made by a majority Councilor, probably all these doubts, all these conspiracy theories, all these ""Eh, but a general evaluation is needed"", these reasonings would not have been made. This is a doubt, for goodness sake, I know very well that it does not work that way. I have finished, I will save myself for the declaration of vote."

If there are no other interventions in the discussion, I close the general discussion. The general discussion is closed. For the Government, Councilor Caveri replies."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,16,5844,"The President will also speak, I will limit myself to a few observations, starting of course from what has already been said, that is, the difficulties, we all know what happens, but fortunately we are not at year zero, because, thanks to autonomy, our territory, despite all its limitations, remains inhabited, remains alive, especially - as has already been done - if we compare it only with the nearby Piedmont valleys: also from a political and administrative point of view, as we well know, they even depend on the metropolitan area of ​​Turin and, if we had not had autonomy, it is very probable that today we would find ourselves in the same and identical situation. The topic that has been raised is interesting and the proposal is also interesting, but it has a whole series of weaknesses, so the reasoning of councilor Lavy is: ""Better a little something than nothing"". I believe instead that, when a line has to be decided, it must be done in a complete manner, and in this regard, in a few minutes, I will try to make some reasoning. I am returning from a meeting on the Alpine macro-region in Slovenia: it is an assembly that certainly needs to be strengthened, it has weaknesses, it was officially born at the beginning of the 2010s and I took the liberty of drawing the attention of my colleagues to ask for greater political commitment and less technocratic vision within the Alpine macro-region, because I believe that the issues that we must address today are four plus one: the first is climate change, which will profoundly modify our territory; the second topic is the energy transition, also considering the ambitious prospects that the Valle d'Aosta Council itself has given itself; the digital revolution, someone mentioned the fact that repopulation also involves techniques such as co-working, and, again, the demographic crisis that, in the Aosta Valley, is actually added to depopulation, that is, the choice that many Aosta Valley residents, since the post-war period, have made to move down, some to the larger municipalities of the valley floor, some instead to the city of Aosta which in the meantime has spread out across what we call the Plaine. Another argument is added that is central to believing that the Aosta Valley is all mountains, which of course does not mean that there can be classifications by area within us; I am not convinced by the altimetry, because someone pointed out that today - as Bernard Janin, the famous geographer, said - those who are most in crisis are those of the medium mountains, if we use the altimetry, we will somehow also facilitate tourist locations where well-being is completely evident. The extra costs are striking, what the University of the Aosta Valley is doing is important, taking up a theme from a few years ago: understanding what the impact of schools, transport, healthcare means; all expenses that weigh heavily on our regional budget and that demonstrate the particularity of the mountain areas that will have to be highlighted, especially when they arrive alongside, or perhaps no longer alongside, differentiated autonomy, the famous LEP. Another scenario: there is a European scenario that we must follow, because we have the same problems: President Kompatscher himself, in a dialogue also with President Testolin, reminded us that they have a high demographic but that has fallen below that percentage of the fertility rate that guarantees a replacement for the population. We are graveyard-like from this point of view. The study by Professor Rosina of the Catholic University of Milan has shown that in 2034 we will have 10 thousand fewer Aosta Valley residents in the intermediate age, that is, the most productive. I would add, because it is very important, that any regional law, which in some way better regulates the particularity of territories higher than the average, must take into account the law on mountains which, with its 28 articles, was approved by the Senate, not because we have to copy it - I am always for original legislation - but because this law allows on the one hand to have a whole series of particularities that can be demonstrated in the legislation of the Regions and autonomous Provinces and, on the other, there are interventions in the matter that are not our competence. I believe it would be interesting to imagine reopening a discussion when we find ourselves faced with a complete text that, among other things, touches on one of the main issues for the Italian mountains, which is the delimitation of mountain areas, because, if there is too much mountain (as happens today in the old delimitations, even from the 1950s) it is very difficult to imagine specific interventions, which are also valid - I remind you in conclusion - for the European Union. With the new President of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, right in Slovenia, we have imagined a European mountain pact, starting with the Alpine mountains, because it is very clear that today in article 174 of the treaties we talk about mountain areas, but that necessary directive that should say what the mountain is, which is then different in the Massif Central rather than in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Apennines, has remained suspended, however a regulation is needed taking into account that many of the matters that we have in article 2 of our Statute of autonomy - I am thinking of agriculture - are basically now linked to decisions that are taken by European politics. It is therefore right to give recognition to the intellectual effort, the legal effort, to arrive at something, however, in all frankness, I believe that the picture is more complex and it can be said that if this was the beginning of a discussion it is good, but it cannot be considered a conclusive phase."

47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,18,6328,"I believe that following the last intervention of colleague Caveri there is little left to add. I would like to make some considerations of a more strictly related nature to the framework on which this legislative initiative was intended to be inserted; a regulatory framework already quite broad, which we had the opportunity to share also during an inspection activity (recalled by colleague Restano) which underlined how within the evolutionary path and attention to the mountain territory and the difficulties of living there... because one thing is to look for prerequisites and indications to support - even on an ongoing basis, assuming that it is the best way - the population that lives in the mountains to be able to do so at lower costs, another thing is to make it usable in an adequate manner and also in step with the times... also so to speak ""infrastructured"" and also generous with opportunities, especially work and support for one's family in the mountains with adequate services; they are two slightly different concepts and the main aspect is to go and observe how a whole series of initiatives that we had already shared there have tried over time to enhance the characteristics of our mountain, with road safety and with the infrastructure, which started in the 90s, of that backbone that should have brought the optical fiber - and brought it, up to our highest villages. Even yesterday, in an interesting meeting developed within the Department of colleague Caveri, with Infratel some opportunities were outlined that can actually create new potential for those who want to move to the mountains. This is a job that is daily accompanied by specific laws to try to enhance the job offers of our territory. : Colleague Jordan mentioned it, also taking up a track that we had already presented a few weeks ago: from support for ski resorts to mountain schools, transport concessions, special attention also to the size and accessibility of the same, initiatives on neighborhood businesses - to talk about situations that are developed within the Regional Council - but, still, in a broader context, among the opportunities that can be made available to the mountains, there are European resources that, first of all, through the rural development plan and activities related to the agricultural world, have tried to enhance a whole series of historical and traditional activities that maintain opportunities for settlement in our territory even in small municipalities and especially in small municipalities where rightly a company, one, two, five people, a family make the difference, despite what may happen in the valley floor. A situation that is also very complex at a national level, I remember that in the years 2015-2016, when there were the first activities to support marginal areas, paradoxically the case occurred where, for example, Cogne, which is a tourist resort of primary importance for our region, was included in the marginal areas when - now I don't want to be wrong - Avise or Saint-Nicolas, which had slightly different altimetric characteristics and not such a significant percentage drop in population as that of Cogne, was not included. Two paradoxes that, if we go to see the two locations, give you a feeling of mountains that is not exactly the same. This is to arrive at the fact that there is a network, a series of initiatives and activities that continue to be developed, such as the investments that are advocated in our territory also at the level of ski lifts, but also all those activities that try to bring safety also for those who live in the mountains: we have already mentioned it a couple of times, but I will never tire of saying it: the helicopter rescue rather than the valorization of those ski-mountaineering activities linked to the world of randonnées, which can and must also bring young people - just as you said - to our territory. This must be accompanied - as my predecessor rightly said - by more structured, more structural indications, which on the one hand certainly pass through the law of the mountain, which has been questioned, which provides a guideline on which a regional mechanism of study and adaptation can then be grafted, also to the characteristics and peculiarities of our territory; on the other hand, a law on the free zone that has as its objective not so much to stabilize over time and over the years, over the decades, a support and a contribution, but to create the conditions to relaunch above all an activity in our marginal areas, which is proclaimed and guaranteed, to which the Region will probably have to contribute, in a significant way, with its resources, because let's say that the feeling is rather that we need to clear the principle of being able to identify autonomously, or in any case agreed upon, the areas in which we want to intervene, because evidently - you teach me - Courmayeur rather than Valtournenche perhaps have less need than Rhêmes-Saint-Georges, rather than Lillianes, Gaby or Champorcher, of initiatives that can be developed on their territory with significant help, limited perhaps in time but which can allow the activation of initiatives in these territories that can then give legs to a virtuous circle that can bring interest back to our territory. This is what we had already said a bit in the Commission, net of other technicalities relating to what is coverage, not coverage. However, it remains, not out of respectability, the fact of recognizing the initiative as having a transversal consensus, which I think was also demonstrated by the colleagues who spoke; I also appreciated the fact that he underlined the negative vote that nevertheless allowed this bill to be brought to the floor and discussed and I believe that the interest is transversal, as has been underlined, and that there will still be time and a way to work carefully especially on those two elements that can really make a difference in this context."

47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,20,3096,"I thank the speakers and proponents of this bill, the 138 of the League. Bill 138 represents an attempt to address one of the most pressing challenges of mountain communities, which is that of depopulation. The Aosta Valley, like many other mountain regions, is experiencing a progressive exodus of the population from smaller centers to the cities; this phenomenon has significant repercussions on the local economy, on culture and on the valorization of our territories. The proposal aims to reverse this trend through a series of concrete measures, mainly focused on economic incentives, therefore the birth allowance or Chèque Valdôtain, an economic contribution to families who choose to have children in small mountain municipalities, incentives for new residents, the Chèque Montagnard, tax breaks and contributions for those who ask or decide to settle in these territories and the enhancement of the territory through the promotion of local culture, therefore support for traditions and minority languages, the development of sustainable tourism, investments and environmentally friendly tourism activities and the guarantee of basic services such as healthcare, school and transport, we talked about it before. From an initial analysis, the League's proposal presents several strong points, a concrete approach, therefore the proposed measures are specific and targeted to solve the problems, attention to families, therefore: incentives for births, for families with children and an enhancement of the territory. In our opinion, even if the proposal represents a step forward in the direction of a regional policy more attentive to the needs of mountain municipalities, some problems emerge; one of these is economic sustainability: putting these measures into practice requires significant economic resources and long-term effectiveness. Economic incentives can be a first step, but a more structural approach is needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of mountain municipalities; collaboration with local authorities: the success of these measures also depends on collaboration with municipalities, as my colleague Chatrian pointed out. To reach a conclusion, the Lega's bill 138 represents an important contribution to the debate on the enhancement of mountain areas, raising a topic of great importance and future for our region, however it is important to underline that the problem linked to the phenomenon of depopulation cannot be solved only with economic incentives, we have said and reiterated several times that a series of long-term territorial development political actions are needed, which take into account all the actors involved in order to achieve concrete and lasting results. Assuming that this bill could also be amended in order to improve it and make it more suitable to the needs of our community, we as a group appreciate the work and for this reason we will vote for it."

I don't know if Councillor Caveri has actually read ""Tradition et renouveau"" by Janin because otherwise, I don't know, he probably wouldn't have made certain arguments... (Interruption off microphone by Councillor Caveri.) ...It is absolutely not offensive, far from it. The issue of altimetry, for goodness sake, is debatable, but I would perhaps invite you one day, indeed, to live a little, to go to Marine di Perloz: I would like to see if that isn't a mountain. It's not a high mountain, for goodness sake, but it is a mountain. Then the issue of climate change is fine, it is obvious that we are facing epochal challenges, as there have always been throughout history, for goodness sake, today we have new ones and therefore we must rightly adapt. The issue of additional costs, which you brought up - if you were offended before, now I give you credit for bringing up an issue that is essential - the issue of additional costs is central, I said it: living in the mountains costs more, and that is why I believe that there is a need for economic help, on the one hand with contributions, on the other with tax relief, things that are proposed by this law, so, for goodness sake, do you not understand 100% how? All right, but, as I said before, where is your proposal? The issue of demography, which was also touched upon earlier by my colleague Chatrian: ""Eh, but this law talks about a birth allowance"", more demography than that... so you can say anything, but not that this law does not touch on the issue of demography. Then President Testolin, as usual, glosses over it a bit... but the thing I'm thinking about - and in my notes I had the answer you gave to colleague Restano, when I mentioned law 17 and various laws - is that it doesn't seem to me that in these laws there is a specific part for mountain areas. There are laws that apply to all areas, so if we take law 17, those who have a farm in the valley bottom and those who have a farm at 1,500 meters benefit from it. It's obvious that it's a law that also helps those who live in the mountains, it's not a law that's only made for those who live in the mountains and that compensates for the extra costs of those who live in the mountains; that's the point. Our laws are not diversified, they are the same for everyone, on the one hand that's fine, on the other hand I think we also need to reflect, but then it's not that those laws only help those who live in the mountains. I really, to conclude, because I understood that there is none, I would really like you to go for a tour of many villages in our municipalities, around the Valley, all the municipalities have villages that are now abandoned, or almost, and there you will understand the roots of depopulation, really. Go to the valleys and talk to those who remain and who will explain to you that their son has decided to leave, maybe not even abroad, he has come down. You will understand from these people the reason why people leave: the extra costs - you said it, Councilor Caveri - and those villages there, if it goes well, will become second homes, if it goes badly, they will be ruined. It is this policy of saying ""We are already doing"" that kills those villages, that kills planning. Let's question ourselves for once, it is not possible to say ""We are already doing, everything is fine"", look at the valleys of Piedmont, we all see the valleys of Piedmont, but if we continue like this, we too will get to the valleys of Piedmont. Let's question ourselves, let's bring forward measures that can also be experimental, the free zone issue is absolutely positive but it's not enough, it's not enough! Do you know when we will no longer talk about depopulation? When the last elder of the last village has passed away, then there will no longer be the problem of depopulation, because there will no longer be anyone living in the Aosta Valley. The fact that there was no will to reason in a concrete way on a text of law and that this law has favorable, interesting principles, but that are not enough, is truly a stab in the back to those who live in the mountains."

If before I highlighted the side of the autonomist spirit that distinguishes this proposed law, on the other hand I simply want to underline, as I said before, beyond the economic factor, an element that strongly characterizes our political force, that is the League, because this is, from another point of view, the attempt to attract to our territory, in particular to the mountain area, an immigration that can be chosen, an immigration that can be sustainable, in contrast to those who instead claim or think that anyone can come to our territory, even when they have attitudes or cultures or mentalities that are difficult to integrate with our millenary culture. I repeat, a law perfectly in line with our party that sees and thinks that those who can come to our territory and feel and become fully-fledged Aosta Valley citizens must be people who have the tools to integrate; in this case it would be the regional body itself that provides tools from a linguistic point of view, which is fundamental. From this point of view, therefore, I believe that it is a bill that is a real shame to remain there, but I think that it will remain, in any case, in the archives and one day, when perhaps historians will look back and listen to the debates of this Council, they will be able to see who had at least the courage to propose something, even on an experimental basis, because my colleague said it very well: even on an experimental basis, rather than settle for and adapt to dynamics that we cannot control without making an effort, perhaps even wrong, perhaps that does not work, but an effort that represents a novelty towards phenomena of great importance and that unfortunately we are unable to govern. I believe that this is a real shame, but, I repeat, whoever proposed something new and had the courage to do so will remain in the annals, while, on the other hand, whoever perhaps made criticisms, had good intentions, then on the table, however, never put anything innovative."

However, it is difficult to answer the question I am asking: ""Whether economic aid can affect the life choices of the family and in particular of our children"". I believe that there are other values, for example the love of the mountains, of culture, of traditions, that cannot be monetized, even at the cost of sacrifices, then tomorrow everything will surely change.

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8009,"The upcoming introduction of fifth-generation mobile phone technology, hereinafter of course referred to as 5G, will give rise to new scenarios of population exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, which will be placed in frequency bands, 694-790 MHz, 3.6-3.8 GHz and 26.5-27.5 GHz, different from those currently used for mobile telephony, from 800 MHz to 2.6 GHz. One of the particularly novel aspects of 5G is that it will not only be aimed at communication between people, but also at the so-called Internet of Things, in which various wireless devices communicate directly with each other, using in particular electromagnetic waves of frequency belonging to the 26.5-27.5 GHz band, often referred to as millimetre waves, even if the latter correspond more precisely to frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz, wavelengths between 1 and 10 mm. Electromagnetic waves of such high frequency, during their propagation, they cannot penetrate buildings or overcome obstacles and are also easily absorbed by rain and leaves. For this reason, it will be necessary to use, to a greater extent than current mobile phone technologies, the so-called Small Cells, areas of land covered by the radio frequency signal whose dimensions, which can range from about ten meters indoors to a few hundred meters outdoors, are much smaller than those of macro cells, which can extend up to several kilometers. This will require the installation of numerous antennas and this proliferation of antennas is one of the main causes of concern among the population about possible health risks associated with 5G electromagnetic emissions. Following the 2013 IARC assessment, which defined radio frequency electromagnetic fields as possible carcinogens due to the effects on head tumors linked to prolonged use of cell phones, numerous studies have been conducted that have investigated the associations between long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields and various health problems, oncological and otherwise. Exposures not resulting from the use of mobile phones but from other sources, such as SRB radio base stations, are of a different nature, especially because the possible effects are not limited to the head and, as appears from monitoring studies, are of lesser intensity. To date, studies on the health effects of exposure to radio base stations provide conflicting results. Furthermore, due to emission limits, 62% of existing sites in urban areas would not be upgradeable to 5G and the extra costs, to create coverage, would amount to approximately 1.3 billion euros per operator. To maintain 6 Volts per meter, an expense of approximately 4 billion euros per year is estimated, a decidedly high cost for telephone companies. It should also be emphasized that 5G emissions combine with other forms of electromagnetic emissions, all with the consequences that such emissions can have on both health and the environment. A group of Swedish researchers have published the world's first study documenting the immediate effects of 5G radiation on human health. These are groups of people who, between 2023 and 2024, began to feel ill immediately after the installation of new 5G antennas near their homes, precisely at a distance of between 3 and 538 meters. In some cases, the symptoms were so severe that they forced people to move elsewhere. The research was conducted by oncologist Dr. Lennart Hardell of the Swedish Foundation for Environment and Cancer Research, known for epidemiological studies on tumors among cell phone users, in collaboration with Mona Nilsson of the Swedish Foundation for Radiation Protection. The researchers measured the electromagnetic field in the homes of those who complained of 5G-related health problems and documented that 5G involves a significant increase in pulsed radiofrequency radiation compared to previous generations of mobile telephony. The people studied had been living near cell phone towers for years, but had never complained of disturbances with the reactions of 2G, 3G and 4G, but they began to feel ill within 24 hours of activating 5G. The Swedish study is particularly innovative, because it documents the health effects of 5G radiation in real conditions of use, while until now there were only studies on the biological effects of the different frequencies of 5G. : The biological effects of radiation are not only related to the power density, which gives information about its intensity and is responsible for heating, but are also determined by the quality of radiation, namely its pulsation, polarization and remodulation. The most common symptoms that were found in the people in question were sleep disturbances, tiredness, headaches, irritability, concentration problems, short-term memory impairment and skin problems. These are the same symptoms described more than 50 years ago as microwave syndrome or radiofrequency sickness. In all the cases observed, the radiation levels were lower than the levels considered safe by international standards; these in fact protect only from the effects of immediate heating of radiation, namely thermal effects, and not from other biological effects that are due to the interference of the external electromagnetic field with that of living systems, and therefore non-thermal effects. Confirming the role of 5G radiation is also the observation that the irradiated subjects, once moved to another house with lower radiation levels, felt better; symptoms were reduced and in most cases disappeared completely after a short period. In Italy, exposure limits are measured over an average of 24 hours and not 6 minutes, as is the case throughout the world. The 6-minute interval is the biological time needed for cells to dissipate the heat produced by radiofrequency radiation through blood circulation. It is therefore a time necessary to protect cells from the effects of heating produced by the electromagnetic field. This choice was made in 2012 by the Monti Government, which increased the average measurement of radiofrequency radiation from 6 minutes to 24 hours, with the aim of diluting the measured values ​​and effectively increasing the limits of radiofrequency radiation. It is therefore clear that, with the growing use of these technologies, studies conducted by third-party bodies with respect to the Regional Administration are necessary, in the name of transparency and full accessibility of information to the community, in order to guarantee the population clear information, especially in the case of installing new antennas near schools, hospitals and residential areas. Moreover, the European Council itself, with a recommendation of 12 July 1999, in act 519 EC, provided at point 6 that Member States should promote research programmes in order to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendations and efforts of community and international research. With this motion, we therefore ask the Regional Government to activate, through funding to be explicitly provided for this purpose, a system of overall study and monitoring of the impact on human and environmental health of the entire system of infrastructures, networks and their emissions that will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, in order to guarantee and protect the health of the Aosta Valley people."

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,4159,"Our group shares the need for digitalization that exists for our country and obviously also for our region. The spread of ultra-wideband throughout the national territory, both with fiber and with 5G, where an alternative is not possible, can serve to fill a gap, that of the Digital Divide which is undoubtedly a gap in our territory. But this must happen, in our opinion - or rather, it had to happen - without changes to the limits of exposure and precautionary attention in the face of risks or potential health risks that, with the increase, can obviously manifest themselves. Currently the limit has been set at 15 Volts per meter, by the competition decree in 2023, and previously it was 6 Volts per meter, so we are talking about more than doubling, and it is a limit that has generated quite a few controversies, because there is no valid reason to raise the value of attention for electromagnetic fields generated by high frequencies, other than the economic one, obviously on the part of telecommunications operators, who intend to save on the costs of their infrastructures. It is a threshold that has been assumed without a real scientific basis and there are strong concerns that have been expressed from many sides, truly many; I will mention only one, because it is the one that, among the many that I have read, also seemed most convincing to me and that is that of Dr. Belpoggi who was for a long time the scientific director of the Ramazzini Institute in Bologna which, as we know, is an institute that deals with cancer prevention. She is currently the scientific director of ISDE, the Association of Doctors for the Environment. Dr. Belpoggi, in a recent publication, stated: ""What will change is the power density, that is, the energy absorbed by our body, which will increase sixfold. Today, Italy wanted to align itself with other European countries, raising its limit, but then why hasn't it also aligned itself with the measurement times? It's true that the limit considered safe is 61 Volts per meter, so we are at 15, which is much lower, so theoretically we should be calm, but the fact is that in other European countries, which also have higher limits than the Italian one, these values ​​were measured at the maximum peaks. In Italy, however, they are measured throughout the day, day and night, so the average is also taken into account during the night hours, where telecommunications traffic, as we know, is, if not zero, almost zero"". So what's happening? That the data, in some way, is distorted. From this it is clear that our body, or that of those who are exposed to these peaks, has a higher frequency, I think there is no doubt about this. At the moment, electromagnetic waves remain a topic that is still, in our opinion, too little investigated. Some in-depth studies have been done, but we believe that they are not - on a general level, I mean - sufficient, because being exposed 24 hours a day, especially for some categories of people, I am thinking of children, the elderly, pregnant women, can be dangerous; I use ""Can"" because we do not have very certain data, but it is something that a whole series of scientists tell us, and so why not replace, for example, the large antennas - which have a concentration - with a series of smaller antennas also to dilute this exposure? We could have maintained the 6 Volts that we had until before the change in the situation, but what was needed to maintain them? A very high expense was needed, which has been estimated between 3 and 4 billion a year, a cost that the operators do not want to sustain. So let's welcome the commitment of this motion, which essentially asks for what? It asks for an in-depth analysis and monitoring of the impact on health. We believe that it is right that an activity of this type be activated, even in our region, precisely because this impact of 5G technology is considered controversially by some and others, but having an in-depth analysis can still help to clarify. We will therefore vote on the motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966.0,M,Presidente,5,109,"Councilor Baccega has booked, followed by Councilor Lucianaz. Councilor Baccega, you have the power."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,6,1424,"English: We read with great attention the motion that was presented by the two opposition groups and that brought us back to the motion that we brought to the attention of the Council last May, identifying in Terna's paths the will and the need to carry out a verification and a series of in-depth studies. Even in the Municipality of Gignod, we had evaluated two different situations, one that crossed the Municipalities from Charvensod to Aymavilles and the other that concerned precisely the antenna that will have to be positioned in the Municipality of Gignod; in that motion we had actually asked for an in-depth study, identifying ARPA as the entity that could give us important information regarding a study that must, in our opinion, be done. The commitment therefore that the motion brings to the attention of the Council, that is to carry out an in-depth study on the health of the entire system of infrastructures and networks and their emissions, which will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, is certainly in line with what we think. It is certainly a matter of going deeper and it is above all a matter of giving a minimum of security also to the populations that in some way are close to these plants and that sometimes are solicited by information that can also be misleading. May science give us concrete answers regarding these paths. We will vote with conviction for this motion."

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,8,11501,"I appreciated the speeches of Councilors Manfrin and Minelli, a sign that they have carefully prepared themselves on this complicated topic, and it would be appropriate for many Councilors here in this chamber to deal with it at least a little. I would also like to thank Baccega for his speech. I supported this motion - it could not be otherwise - and in doing so I am addressing in particular the majority of the Council, which is so sensitive to the issues of health and the ecosystem, so resilient in fighting their battle in the name of a cleaner and healthier environment; in particular, responsible fathers who are concerned about the future of future generations. I wanted to tell you that electromagnetic fields are one of the most widespread environmental pollutants, rapidly increasing in the environment, and that they are capable of biological modifications on cells and living organisms, including humans. Magnetic fields are natural, as we know, they control all the vital processes of living beings, therefore molecular movements, cellular oscillations, ionic interactions. Electromagnetic fields are produced by nature, and I am talking about cosmic rays, light energy, geomagnetism of the earth and living beings themselves. The fact is that until 1940 the natural pulsed background was 0.0002 Volts/meter, but in the last century there has been a huge entry of artificial fields at low and high frequencies, so radio antennas, telephones, electric cables, lamps, household appliances, power lines etc. etc., at high frequency, at low frequency, at low frequency but high intensity, etc. etc., the subject is very complex. The level of radiofrequency radiation since 1940, or rather, let's make it shorter, from 1985 to 2005, in 20 years, the level of radiofrequency radiation in industrialized countries has increased 5 thousand times, so 5 thousand times more radiation than human beings, like all living beings, receive. Will it do well? The 5G system was born in the last century in the USA from a research of the military industry for the guidance of tanks, drones, missiles, 3D image visualizations, it works with elements emitting high frequency waves, in the 700 MHz and 27 GHz bands, but it will soon reach 86 GHz, impressive things, with Phased array antennas, which are phased array vectors, I won't make it more difficult, but here is the problem that we would have to deepen the fixed geometry of the currently existing 3G networks, while the 5G network requires a different geometry. All this to say that we are installing a 5G on the fixed geometry of the 3G, this is naturally underused, but these are topics that we hope to address on site with the technicians. In all this, the 5G will operate with much higher frequencies than those used so far and will add to the fields of the current 2G, 3G and 4G, making it difficult for the ARPA to measure the electromagnetic field. It will be necessary to install numerous micro repeaters in urban areas: 250 antennas per square mile are calculated, which corresponds to one antenna every 100 m² approximately, remember, there will be one antenna every 100 m². Today's news: in Milan, a thousand street lamps will see the installation of small cells, which colleague Manfrin was talking about, installed on public lighting poles, A2A will take care of it. What's happening? That the small cells on the street lamps will be at the beginning of a process that will lead to the network, naturally more powerful, more widespread to improve the connection, but residents are already collecting signatures, because this is the first step towards a Smart City model, naturally this to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. But what's happening elsewhere? In Arezzo on October 8, 2024, so I'm talking about a little over a month ago, the Municipality made an about-face. The Municipality of Arezzo has proceeded to draft an order of cancellation ex officio in self-protection regarding the installation of the new radio base station for cellular telephony. The act was consequently entrusted to the technical opinion that highlighted the prevalence of the protection of public health over the provision of mobile telephony services, moreover the area was already covered. ""The antenna must be dismantled"", these are the words of the Municipality, the lack of urgency and urgency were highlighted, as prerequisites for the release of the authorization and the unavailability of the company to find a different solution forced them to this decision. It is therefore decided to proceed with the cancellation ex officio of the authorization act previously granted and, consequently, to order the restoration of the state of the places. The antenna was taken and taken away. Following the example of the Mayor of Cassano Ionio, it is worth remembering: he issued an order requesting a halt to the work, pending the completion of all checks to ensure the protection of the population's health. In Tuscany, you know, on September 22nd, so not even two months ago, the resolution of the Regional Council, signed by the Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, I repeat: the Regional Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, certainly more attentive to the health of their fellow citizens than other mountain areas that we know well, allocated a sum of 222 thousand euros to conduct what is perhaps the first scientific research conducted at a public level, at least in Italy. Tuscany has decided to conduct a study on 5G, six provincial capitals of about 100 thousand inhabitants, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Florence, Prato and Arezzo, or rather, some of much more than 100 thousand, will try to understand what the link is between the tumors suffered by the population, especially children, and the electromagnetic fields generated by the base stations that are springing up everywhere in Tuscany. Up to now the scientific community, as my colleagues who preceded me claimed, has only investigated the aspect of electromagnetic fields, that is, the thermal aspect. The aspect on biological tissues is very different. There will be the two regional agencies that are involved. ARPA Toscana is responsible for measuring exposure to pollution from superfast broadband; among its tasks: analyzing the limits and development scenarios of the 5G network; developing a mathematical model that allows the prediction on an urban scale of the levels of exposure present in the provincial capitals; measuring exposure with the control units already in place and purchasing others; carry out checks on existing 5G systems, possibly from different operators, and on those under construction that are being installed; apply special broadband dosimeters to the systems to measure exposure and evaluate exposure levels where it is highest and where the population density is highest, especially in areas where there are schools, with the presence of children. The ARS, the Regional Health Agency, will instead be responsible for: health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance in cities where slightly higher levels of electromagnetic fields are recorded, the estimates can also be refined within homes and schools; estimate the possible associations between exposure to electromagnetic fields and diseases. ""Based on the limited scientific literature available,"" says the ARS, ""it is planned to focus attention on the child population, as they are more susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic pollution."" What happens to children? It happens that EMFs, that is, electromagnetic fields, have no problem crossing the human body, as demonstrated by the images obtained from magnetic resonance radiology equipment, which show the entry of the field into the human skull upon contact, for example, with a cell phone. This dynamic is at the basis of the pathogenesis of acoustic nerve tumors and areas of brain tissue exposed to the side of contact with the mobile phone. The impressive thing is that in adults, the penetration is a few centimeters, while in a child it passes almost completely through the brain, naturally having a more fragile, lighter base. Doctor Gandus, who was connected recently with Aosta, on the occasion of an evening dedicated precisely to the subject, maintained that the increase in childhood brain tumors is being found in the 2000s and probably one of the causes could be precisely electromagnetic waves. The studies - they were cited by the colleague - are endless, we are talking about more than 10 thousand studies, and we cite the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the study by Prof. Hardell, the National Toxicology Program, the Ramazzini Institute was also cited, etc. etc., but we also have the sentences in court: the TAR of Lazio in 2019 and the TAR of Monza in March 2019 attested the link between electromagnetic fields and cancer beyond any reasonable doubt. What is happening here in Valle d'Aosta, instead? Twice, the Councilor for the Environment replied to me that the data correspond to what the literature and recent studies have documented, but the problem is that there is this institute that carried out these surveys, the ICNIRP, International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection, and it established 61 Volts/meter as the non-worrying level, and it is the measure adopted at European level. The problem is that this institute is considered an authority only by the European Commission, which has given the task to this small private association from Bavaria to draw up the guidelines for limiting exposure. The task was assigned in 1997 and in 1998 these measures were already issued, that is 61 Volts/meter, but the studies - I spoke of more than 10 thousand studies worldwide - support something very different, and that is that already at 0.2 Volts/meter there is interaction with human tissue, so there is certainly a lot to do, there is a lot to investigate. The result is that, in addition to this disaster on land, the 5G project will also arrive from space. A launch into orbit of at least 20 thousand satellites is planned that will cover the earth with adjustable bands from the stratosphere, each one will emit 5 million watts on the ground that will connect to the billions of objects of the Internet of Things, we are talking about cars, televisions, sensors, computers and tablets, it is estimated that already in 2020 there were over 20 billion of these objects connected, making the environment where we live a real microwave oven 24 hours a day, with no escape, without the possibility of turning it off or hiding somewhere else. So let's welcome, let's hope for a little, a little - it doesn't require much - common sense from this Government, let's welcome an in-depth analysis: I must admit that the President of the Third Commission, to whom I asked for the possibility of obtaining hearings by the scientific world in this chamber, has taken action and we should soon agree on these meetings. The request is that the scientific world be listened to and not only the highly respected technicians of ARPA, for whom we have all the due respect, but here we have scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to this research. We have scientists, we have doctors, who daily confront this problem. I would really like to understand what could be the impediment to seriously delve into this topic."

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,10,4011,"This time it's my turn because we're talking about pylons, as well as talking about 5G technology. I've heard the well-known theories of those who are against 5G, it's an interesting, anti-modernist movement, which is connected to other anti-modernist theories. I remember the one that said that those who got the vaccine would die, now, making horns, I don't want to die at the end of my speech, but it's quite clear that there are contradictions that I would like to say right away. I understand the position of Councilor Lucianaz, who has always fought, and we must also acknowledge the technical competence that would make the physics degree of colleague Lavevaz envious, but I find that there is a contradiction in the colleagues of the League and in the colleagues of Forza Italia, because it was your Governments, and in particular the Meloni Government, that increased the rate of electromagnetism - as my colleague Minelli recalled with the date of 2023 - just as it is your Government that went back on a legislative decree that would have given some chance to the Municipalities to at least move those pylons that will also be placed in the Aosta Valley. I only have to correct Councilor Minelli: 5G are small systems, the technology is very different. There will be more small pylons compared to the large pylons we have today. So it is difficult today, Councilor Manfrin, to hear the Aosta Valley League - I imagine in a logic of federalism, which I appreciate - saying things that are contrary to what the Government says. The Government has, in fact, liberalized the positioning of pylons, today no one can do anything, neither the Region, nor the municipal master plans, and we will see how the Arezzo issue ends, because it is in the hands of the administrative justice. With the latest regulations that on the one hand have increased the limits of electromagnetic fields in Italy, which remain - I also say this to Councilor Minelli - lower than the European average, but above all with the law converting a recent decree law, there is this provision: in order to allow the timely achievement of digital transformation objectives for the interventions of the 5G Italy Plan for the creation of new suitable network infrastructures, practically nothing can be done anymore. We do not have Municipalities that today say: ""Instead of putting the pylon there, we put it there"", they have no power. This was a political clarity. I repeat, those who are against 5G, do so legitimately, I am surprised that those who today with a State law have favored a massive movement of these pylons, today in this chamber say the opposite. Then, for goodness sake, I repeat, I imagine that there is a local respect and I would not want it to be just a wink to those who are against 5G. Because there is no need for a specific study to be done, I am not the one saying this, I obviously have studied it in depth with the technicians of the Department, but above all with the ARPA, which is the one that must take the measurements, which must correspond to those limits that, as I said before, have increased. According to the ARPA it is useless, because it itself is part of an Italian ARPA system that continues to have a constant exchange of information regarding the scientific research that is done and as you know there is also a central body called ISPRA, also in connection with all the institutes that are doing the research and that largely deny some of the things that you said today, because to date the official results are those that regulate national legislation and we do not have, as autonomy, a possibility of changing technical standards that even have a European value. According to ARPA, it is more than enough to be part of this system, today it would be specific studies in Valle d'Aosta and money wasted, because all the institutes of which it is part, with very broad collaborations, our ARPA, are doing it with great effectiveness, therefore we will abstain."

You tell me that nothing more can be done, we take note of that, but in our opinion, an in-depth study with respect to the populations that have the Superphénix passing over their roofs... something will have to be seen and done because, in my opinion, there will be some problems. We will also carry out in-depth studies.

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,6464,"Thank you, Councilor Caveri, for your answer that, for once, honestly, I expected to be different, precisely because I know that you are a person who prepares and who delves into the issues; instead you objectively fell into an answer that is more obvious than Mickey Mouse jokes, and I regret this for two reasons. The first is that you tried to try to paint the people who raise a request, which is not to return to the Stone Age, to live like the Mormons, but is a request - as was correctly said by colleagues from Forza Italia, as well as by other colleagues who preceded me during the illustration of this initiative, during the general discussion - to have protections and to do in-depth studies from the point of view of health. English: I am not known for being one of those who want to plant daisies on the highway, so I cannot be accused of being someone who hates modernity, I certainly hate impositions, you know that you and I think differently about mandatory vaccinations for example, I am for freedom, you are for forcing people, under penalty of social and work-related death, they are questions of choice: he was very happy that there were obligations for people who did or did not do a certain health treatment and this marks the difference between us which is absolutely legitimate, as you have highlighted. However, if you had had a less ideological and more substantive approach - because you are capable of doing this type of analysis, absolutely, certainly much more than the undersigned who has done less politics than you - and had limited yourself to reading the text, you would have seen that there is no conspiracy theory here, no flat-eartherism, no hypothesis of erasing any technological network in our region, but a very simple request, that is, to do studies and delve into the issue of the potential risks of the network. You raised the political issue and I am happy that you did, I will obviously answer you in two parts. The first is that if you go and look, despite the increase that you mentioned, which is absolutely correct, Italy remains one of the European countries with the lowest emissions, with the lowest limits, so evidently this increase was made, but keeping in mind that it was necessary to remain within certain standards, obviously receiving criticism, which you rightly recalled - and I think I don't have to explain to you, especially since you had a cohabitation in the Council with political movements, with ideas that you did not share - but sometimes, when you govern, you also have to find a compromise and sometimes you share things that perhaps you do not share, I am not saying that this has happened but I am speaking in general. I must tell you another thing, however, Councilor Caveri, that on the political issue you are forgetting a small passage, that is that this same commitment and this same study was decided by the Tuscany Region and not with a motion, but with a Council resolution. The last time I checked, and I check every morning, the Tuscany Region also had its own regional agency for control. The moment you tell us that the ARPA controls are sufficient, you tell us that the Tuscany Region is a Region of reckless madmen - who have a regional agency that doesn't work, flat-earthers, who probably even walk around with tinfoil over their heads so as not to be psychologically manipulated... - or we can accept the fact that perhaps, having a further study and further investigation, can only do good, because maybe it also supports what you say, maybe it confirms that there is no problem, that everything is fine, or maybe not. This reminds me a little of what happened this morning and what happened last week during the Commission: we asked to have a hearing with the business categories to get their opinion, but no, they said no, because they prefer to avoid the risk that someone might deny what you say or question it, and here I feel like I'm in exactly the same situation. They are afraid to do an in-depth study because maybe the results are not what they expected. Now you see, Councillor, we have approached the debate with the utmost openness, I think you can give me credit for that, I have not raised political issues, I have not raised issues, flat-earther crusades, I have simply raised a question which is what you see, there is raised somewhere an evident possibility that this could be harmful to health, because either we imagine that everything is always fine, or, if we want to put, as you have rightly done several times on several issues, science first, we can imagine that science often questions itself and has doubts - it is the essence of a demonstration - so having had this technology for a short time, even the long-term effects of this technology are not known. If what you say is actually true, then the recommendation of the European Council of 12 July 1999, which calls for promoting research programmes to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, would make no sense, taking into account the recommendation of international community research efforts, it will probably have been a flat-earth Europe that does not believe in progress and that wants to reduce us all to bring back the stone age or perhaps there are legitimate concerns. Perhaps, at this point, the Region, which is governed by the Democratic Party, will actually be a reckless Region, and then I advise you to perhaps communicate this to your colleagues, saying that your colleagues in Tuscany are all crazy and do not understand anything or perhaps perhaps raise doubts. Raising doubts, having doubts probably also leads to having results that can confirm or deny what we hypothesize, on one side and the other. I believe that this is a doubt that can come to everyone. You think you have the science infused and say: ""No, it is not like that"", we are sorry for you, but for us it is not like that. We obviously will not withdraw this motion, we are clearly anxious to see how the vote will be distributed, we have expressed our position and I think it is clear."

You are, in my opinion of course, and I agree with what I say, the disappointment of a people, because asking to delve into a topic like that of electromagnetic waves, on which all the communities... I mentioned last time the communities of the Ligurian Levant, where the Ligurian ANCI took action to ask for further information, and, among other things, the President of the Liguria Region had difficulties precisely on these aspects. We ask you to at least discuss it in the Commission, which among other things are classified, so the data cannot even be released, not even that... I mentioned Article 191 of the European Treaty, so dear to Councilor Caveri, which puts the protection of health before economic interests; we all know this, there are large, enormous economic interests, well, let's try to protect them, some are more convinced than others, perhaps no one is against progress. Then if I participate in demonstrations with the No Vax I do so willingly, I don't go to see who you hang out with, and in any case I don't care at all. The point is that I support the freedom of every citizen of the Aosta Valley to express themselves and I also go to listen to them, look at that. The fact that recent studies, certified, etc. continue to be cited... I continue to reiterate that the Institute of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Protection from Non-Ionizing Radiation that I told you about before, is a private agency, with limited activity, made up of a non-institutional Commission of twelve members, Bavarian, in which, moreover, no doctor was present - and I address my colleague Councilor Barmasse, who told me that there is no doctor in this hearing. There is not a doctor here in this Commission either, look at that, and yet ARPA, like all other political governments, relies on this study. You may not know, I'll tell you this too: in 2020 the Court of Appeal of Turin denounced the conflict of interest of the Bavarian ICNIRP that I told you about before, defining it as ""a private organization, whose guidelines have great economic and strategic importance for the telecommunications industry"", with which several members of the ICNIRP have ties through consultancy relationships. The Court of Appeal of Turin also says, ruling from 2020: ""It is evident that these subjects should refrain from evaluating the effect on health, which ICNIRP itself has declared safe and not harmful to health"". These are rulings of Italian courts. You smile, as usual continue in this spirit. You are a real disappointment."

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,18,3819,"To declare my vote and to confirm what I said previously, that is, that we will support this motion, but also to make a consideration more than anything else on the response given by Councilor Caveri, that is, the very heart of the motion, that is, the need or not to do a specific study. The Councilor says: ""There is no need to do a specific study, I'm not saying it, ARPA says it, it is completely useless because ARPA is within a national system of which ISPRA is also a part and therefore there are already studies that speak, that document a series of things"". I think we all know that ARPA is within the SNPA system, that is, the federal system that includes twenty-one environmental agencies, because there are the two autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, and which rightly also includes ISPRA, but what does this system do? It is a system that collects the studies that the individual agencies do, and then obviously also elaborates some guidelines, gives indications to the other agencies, but I don't really understand why our ARPA couldn't, in our territory, do a small study with the characteristics that we have highlighted and then obviously share it, within the system, reason with the others, because normally this is what they do, with the supervision of ISPRA, with the relationships that exist between the various agencies. The motivation leaves me a little perplexed, that we can't change things is fine, it can absolutely be accepted, but contributing to a scientific study on a territory that is limited (which perhaps could also lend itself to making assessments to share and perhaps to validate or not validate through the other agencies that can do the same action in their own territory) seems to me to be a fairly sensible thing. Honestly, it is something that has left me a little perplexed as a motivation. I would also like to make a clarification, but I think that the Councilor, when he spoke, was not referring to us so much, then it seems to me that he also made it quite explicit regarding the issue that there are people who are against 5G. I specified, intervening, that from our point of view this is a technology that should not be demonized, that both fiber and 5G can be useful to fill the gap that exists, that is, the fact that our country is still poorly digitalized, but this should not be done at the expense of what could be the protection of citizens' health. I do not pretend to say that it is absolutely negative, I reported opinions that are the opinions of scientists, and I believe that they also have a very respectable curriculum, but then, precisely to arrive at a definition and a closing of the circle, all the studies that can be done, in my opinion, are useful and can also be used for a broader debate that obviously does not only involve our region. It is obvious that we are within a very complex country system, but I certainly agree with what the Councilor said about the fact that, at the level of government decisions, moving the limits from 6 Volts/meter to 15 is a decision that was taken at a central level, so it is obvious that choices were made on this. Then everyone can have concerns, which are absolutely legitimate, and want to go into more detail, I think it has been explained, this does not take away the fact that our country was in a better situation compared to other European countries - certainly from my point of view - because those 6 Volts per meter were, from the point of view of health protection, better than 15, but this was not the case, it was decided differently and there are obviously responsibilities on this."
