On 18 October, the Government approved an agreement with the geopolitical study group Fondation Grand Continent for the organisation of the 2024-2025 editions of the Grand Continent Summit, which also includes the partial use of the Maison du Val d'Aoste. In short, part of the Maison du Val d'Aoste will host the operational core of the geopolitical study group that organises the Summit and which will help the Region to carry out activities and events of interest to the Aosta Valley in Paris, in the premises of the Maison or in other locations. We have decided to experiment with this new form of use of the structure that intends to bring the Maison du Val d'Aoste back to the original idea for which it was created in 1999, namely not an information office on the Aosta Valley, but a place where we can imagine and carry out initiatives aimed at presenting the Aosta Valley in its various historical, cultural, linguistic and economic facets in Paris - or perhaps in other places in France too -, where we can create institutional relations between the Aosta Valley, France and the French-speaking world; where we can welcome the Aosta Valley emigration, both historical and current. The final details are being defined in order to be operational before the end of 2024."

And yet there is a certain point of view that is not included in the studio of Finaosta, it will be announced and repeated, it will be shown in some modo tracciato of this new route that has been presented to the President. Naturally, you should learn everything you need to pass if you think about a kind of experiment and use a variety of things that allow you to stay up to date. Keep track of this topic, and deepen it by resuming all the details that have been written at the end to understand that this was the road that was followed by the owner of the studio."

First of all, I thank Councillor Lucianaz for this question, which has the merit of shedding light on an event, the 1966 plane crash in which Corrado Gex lost his life along with seven other people, which is still under investigation. On the other hand, the question provides information on the results of the examinations carried out by the University of Milan, of which the Regional Administration is not aware. We are therefore unable to answer your question, except to communicate that we will try to ask the Cuneo Public Prosecutor's Office for an update on the status of the investigations."
47915,XVI,06/11/2024,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,1875,"Well, so the Regional Administration, the Government have no news. As you well know, this body, what is left of this body (the coffin, if you like), was removed 4 years ago and analyses were carried out on this body, for two main reasons and that is to say: if this corpse that remains actually belongs to Corrado Gex, since there are doubts expressed by various people; secondly, it is the question of the presence of neurotoxic gas that could be at the origin of this accident. So, as the University of Milan has not been able to give answers - at least we are still waiting for answers - after 4 years, something that is extremely rare, it really does not happen often, to keep a body in an analysis laboratory for 4 years; the question is that this body is now in Finland, from what I have learned, in an institute that is deepening its studies, but I believe that a character, to leave the chronicle, such as Corrado Gex, deserves that the Aosta Valley Government and the entire Aosta Valley community take care of him, take care of the truth of what happened that day. This accident has not yet had definitive answers to this day and it is because of this that I personally and the group to which I belonged, my colleague Robert Luboz, had presented, on May 22, 2019, a motion committing the President of the Region to try to obtain all the official documents and the results on this body; and now the President, at the time Mr. Antonio Fosson, had made the commitment and, unanimously, the Council had expressed itself to know this truth. So, I ask this Government to make an effort so that the memory of Corrado Gex, as we are rapidly approaching the 60th anniversary of the accident... that it at least tries to look into the matter in more depth."

48019,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,3873,"First of all, I would like to thank the Councillor for giving us the opportunity to take stock of the situation on the Palafent. There is currently no situation concerning the Palafent structure that prevents its full use from a sporting point of view, moreover, on Monday 18 November the deadline for submitting bids to participate in the public auction, launched by the Fédérachon, for the management of the bar-restaurant closed, as we know, following the dispute with the managing president, expired. As for the work requested by the Fédérachon Esport de Nohtra Téra, I inform you that the following work has been carried out: energy efficiency for the entire structure for a total amount of 350,000 euros; intervention of the water meter users division; the replacement of the drain pump of the wastewater collection tanks and the remote control of its operation, on this point the Public Works Department reports that the problem concerned exclusively the caretaker's accommodation and not the toilet drains of the establishment; the overall intervention to fit out these drains, which is not essential to the use of the infrastructure, will however be scheduled soon after the analysis of the possible intervention alternatives. In addition, the real estate and sports infrastructure structure of the Public Works Department, following the identification of the new manager, will carry out a joint inspection with the Fédérachon to check the functionality of the electrical heating systems, the catering and caretaker's accommodation areas and, possibly, carry out the necessary development and restoration interventions taking into account the priority of our uses, which has lasted more than a year. Finally, the Department of Natural Resources recently entrusted our services for the adaptation of the automated irrigation system of the green space, to optimize the creation of a lawn for their sports activities, for a total of approximately 50,000 euros, work that will be completed we hope very, very soon, between the end of the year, by the end of the year. As for the third point, we therefore confirm the attention of the Regional Government to popular sports, both with regard to the Fédérachon and the sports associations that compose it, as well as with regard to the structure in question; proof of this is that during the year 2024, at the request of Fédérachon, the budgetary allocation of 95,000 euros for traditional sports was increased to 150,000 euros, the additional sum of 55,000 euros was granted as an expense account necessary for the realization of the vast activity carried out for the promotion of traditional sports in schools, given that the amount of the association had remained unchanged for several years, as well as for new activities. The FENT plans in particular to proceed, among other things, with a multilingual reprint of the brochure on traditional sports to be distributed in schools of all levels, as well as at the extra-regional level and for promotional purposes, to participate in international activities organized by the European federations, to create a short video presenting the traditional games of the Aosta Valley, highlighting their social, cultural and geographical context to be distributed on the social networks and websites of the Fédérachon, but also of the international associations of traditional sports, as well as to provide for the digitization of its documentary photographic archives. In this regard, I wanted to emphasize that a meeting is planned very soon with the President of the Fédérachon, with the competent Assessorates to establish a program of initiatives to achieve what still remains to be done."

Well, thank you for the answer, which is quite, quite complete and even elements in addition to what I had asked, so here we can only be satisfied with the answer, we hope that the new manager of the area is someone serious at least, because this structure surely needs good management and, if everything you have just told us is going to be achieved, well, we are surely going in the right direction and we wish the popular sports of the Aosta Valley great success."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,9265,"This motion has been on the agenda of the Regional Council for a long time now, but it is still relevant, indeed, most likely we could have added something else in the introduction, so it is a motion that once again wants to report and draw attention to the need for updates and clarity regarding the expansion of the Parini hospital complex, a project that - we said it in 2021, when we resigned for this very reason - is of fundamental importance for the Aosta Valley community, so let's go back to 2021, because it is useful to remember all the steps. English: We recall that in 2021, during the discussion of the petition of the Vallée Santé Committee, not our resolution was voted on, despite having been voted on in the Commission, after which the five colleagues who left our group decided to follow another path, a resolution was voted on that requested, urged the activation of a working table between the Institutions, therefore between the Region, the Municipality of Aosta and the designers, with the aim of verifying the technical, economic and temporal feasibility of the project, especially in light of the new challenges that emerged with the pandemic. This resolution, we recall, committed to proceed with the variant of the executive project of the east wing of the Hospital, to simultaneously continue the design phases of the renovation of the current Hospital and complete the definition and identification of the hospital services that would also be activated taking into account the pandemic, to start a discussion on the destination of the Beauregard Hospital and the former Maternity, to present the project to the Aosta Valley population through the most appropriate tools. Since then, a small room has appeared right next to the Hospital, an Info Point, right next to the construction site, which I believe does not find much participation, I often pass in front of the Hospital and I have never seen anyone inside that small room and above all, seeing the slides that pass, if we are interested in the archaeological excavations, what is inside that video is certainly of great interest, but, if we are interested instead in what concerns the Aosta Valley health system, we find very little. English: Many initiatives have been made mainly by our group and by the Rassemblement Valdôtain group to ask that, following that hearing on April 10, there be updates, this is because I went to watch that hearing again, to take back the various passages and, apart from the fact that the planners were not present, so this alone would have deserved a hearing, but on the other hand I also went to take that hearing and to check which documents then arrived precisely following that hearing and I can say that many of the questions we asked in that hearing have not found any answer to date: an example - naturally I take the passages referred to in my speech - I asked to have an analysis on the appropriateness of the operational beds and the consequences of the articulation of the hospital structures, this is because at a certain point, during the hearing, there was talk of double radiology, so one radiology in the old Parini, one in the expansion, it was not clear, also in light of the questions asked by councilor Manfrin, what was the fate, for example, the pharmacy, so on this point we absolutely had no answers. After that we also focused on the issue of limitations related to the helipad where we know well it will be placed above the hospital, but we know equally well, with limitations, to one flight per day with respect to the possibility of landing on that structure. Then there were also questions from councilor Lucianaz to which you had not been given an answer and which perhaps he will then present. I imagine that the Councilor will tell us: ""I have already come to the hearing on April 10"", if you think that the hearing of April 10... moreover there was also a speech by Councilor Marquis, who said: ""But holding a hearing without the plans, without having an awareness of what is being done makes little sense"", so, even from a planning point of view, very probably... but this is the Councilor's field and certainly not mine, so perhaps he will also be the one to explain the reasons with respect to those steps that had taken place on April 10 and which, in essence, gave space to new hearings, this is what we seemed to have understood, or in any case also to the sending of new documentation that we requested right there. English: We must also remember that, after that hearing on April 10, thanks to the various initiatives, we learned from Councilor Marzi, on February 9, 2024 we were told that the validation of the executive project was close to completion. On July 11, 2024, so a few months later - ""close"" is perhaps subjective depending on who is speaking -, again it was said: ""No, but it is a matter of very little"". From that February 9 to October 15, eight months have passed and from 2021 to today, more than three years have passed. Furthermore, as I remembered, during the discussion of that petition it was also said: ""No, but we must continue with the project, in the meantime with the design phases of phase 4 and 5, because in this way we have an idea of ​​the overall costs for the entire hospital facility"", because, in my opinion, it is good to remember that the expansion will only be for the acute hospital, so it is not everything we need. Nothing more has been said about the fate of the Beauregard, we have not had any updates on this either, and also about the fate of the former Maternity Hospital, all things put in that petition. With this motion we therefore ask the Health Councillor again to come to the V Commission, perhaps even with all the documentation, within 15 days - because it seems to us that, given that more than 8 months have passed, even if we put a rather short time, we can do it -, to come and present us with the verification of the technical-design and economic compatibility, as well as the feasibility in adequate chronological terms of the expansion project of the Parini Hospital. This is essentially what was envisaged in the resolution and naturally to also present all the design variations and the state of the art of the works in the various hospital facilities, because the only certainty we have is that the Aosta Valley will never have a single facility, this is the only thing that the Aosta Valley health workers were asking for and it is the only thing we know we will never have. We also saw the resolution of November 4 that tells us about 178 million and here too we repeat that it is only about the expansion and the projects, therefore not about everything that is needed, therefore it would also be interesting to understand what the total costs are, if we have an idea, what the expansion costs, the demolition of the superfetations, the entire renovation of the old Parini, the construction of the maternal and child center, the relocation of the Psychiatry and so on and so forth and also when they think of finishing all this, because one of the things we had highlighted and continue to say is that we absolutely needed the Hospital and it had to be decentralized, it had to be unique, it had to be ready soon. At the moment, however, we know very little. As I was saying, we certainly know that it will not be a unique facility, but we know nothing about everything else. Maybe the Councilor knows, maybe he can tell us today, but what we want is to go back to the hearing first to provide the documentation requested on April 10th that we are still waiting for, but then to ask questions, because it is enough to go and see that hearing to understand that, having no idea of ​​what was inside that Hospital, very few questions could be asked, therefore also have an idea of ​​the beds. English: I also read - however, since it was downloaded only today, I read the resolution quickly this morning - that in essence the Municipality of Aosta was raising problems with respect to traffic and on the other hand was asking that the planned parking spaces also be used for other needs, therefore not only for those going to the hospital, but for those who also want to visit the city of Aosta, therefore also understanding with respect not only to traffic, but to the spaces that we know have also been reduced where we are going and what the priorities will be that have been set in the project, because there was talk of two parking spaces for every bed, it is normal that, if anyone can park there, those two parking spaces will most likely no longer exist. These are all questions that cannot be narrowed down in a debate on a motion and that is why we ask, for the umpteenth time, to come to the Commission to present this project and the whole vision that this majority has with respect to this work, which, as I said, is extremely necessary and which is becoming, in our opinion, the biggest flop of this majority, but this is our vision. Let's see what the Councilor will answer us and then we will also evaluate the next steps."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,11015,"Bondzor a tcheutte. [Literal translation from the patois: Good morning everyone]. The requests of my colleague Guichardaz are sacrosanct, clarifications are being requested in the Committee. Unfortunately, this is a record that is heard too often on this subject, but with the permission of my Group Leader, taking the floor, I must nevertheless give a small explanation for what happened yesterday. Yesterday I did not respond to a colleague who called me ""that's disgusting, you should be ashamed"", etc., because I thought it was decidedly absurd, instead, seeing today the unleashing of press articles, at least to the Chamber and to those listening I owe two explanations, starting from the fact that yesterday I was commenting with a colleague of mine, certainly out loud, on the issue of the manner in which the floor was granted and I did not address absolutely any epithets to those who had the floor... but like this Padovani... (intervention by Councillor Padovani, off microphone) go ahead and be sarcastic, colleague, but I don't listen to the stupid things you say, so don't worry. For this fact I have been condemned by several press outlets, in particular the Aosta Valley agencies, sounding boards of the PD and, patience, it is not the first time that these press agencies report untrue facts, such as the constant reference to the ""great farce"" that I would have pronounced in 2022, I have never said a ""great farce"", however it continues to be reported with a quote. With my colleague, however, yesterday we cleared things up, I believe in a peaceful and reasonable way, I also told him that, if he feels offended, I apologize, I say it publicly, I was not addressing him, so I think for me that the matter can end here. If I then have to justify myself further, I have no problem supporting it. However, I believe that, chatting with a colleague, I can at least have the right to use the words I want. I repeat: with the colleague there was nothing and the epithet was not addressed to him, then everyone can consider the fact as they like. I will take the time to reread the article by Piero Minuzzo because it seems quite worrying to me. I am talking about the Hospital and I come to the motion because on December 4, 2023, in a hearing at the Municipality of Aosta, we heard several municipal councilors complain about the fact that the technicians do not give answers, they asked for certain times and precise data that were not provided on that occasion either, fortunately, the hearings of the Municipality of Aosta are public, so we can quote them, right, President? Another opposition councilor expressed in front of the engineer who was reporting: ""It is difficult to have a political debate without the presence of the other party, given that the technicians act on the mandate, I would have been very pleased to see regional politics here"", other interventions by the Renaissance group, etc., so even the Municipality of Aosta was not given the answers that are continued to be asked for in this Council. Let's move forward, in the sense that, remembering that the executive design of the Hospital of the new wing of the expansion was from 2013, I repeat: the executive design was then stopped in 2014 by the Regional Council, then the archaeological findings, etc. ... we have a statement from the engineer that the Hospital was expected to be delivered in December 2019, you all know this, even the newspapers know it. The fact is that they continue to ask for data that is not provided. This week we learn that the expansion of the Parini Hospital is planned for the modest sum of 178.5 million, so, in addition to documentation that we hope will be provided, otherwise we will try to get it in a different way, in addition to the 31-page report - and then I will take up some passages of this report -, we ask whether these 178.5 million euros are concentrated on the expansion, on the part of block K and Hospital Street alone, possibly, excavation work still to be scheduled for the archaeological aspect permitting and here I would like to know from the Councilor what he intends to do in that area that has not yet been excavated. We therefore normally ask, and we will also ask in the Commission, how much the total amount of the works for the entire Parini complex will be, including phases 4 and 5 of which we have absolutely no documentation. To return to Block K, I remember that in the Commission, that famous 10th April, several questions were asked, not all of which received an answer, I will summarize a few to refresh the Councilor's memory, that is, if on the top floor of Hospital Street, which houses a conference room, refreshment services and other things, if he means the floor below the connecting gallery between the two buildings and here no answer was given; where would the bus stop, if it narrows the roadway, indeed, the roadway will often, for the works, be narrowed to a single lane and they wondered where the bus stop was, where pedestrians crossed, if sidewalks were not planned, they are not indicated on the rendering, how will it be possible to cross Viale Ginevra at ground level and for how long will the use of the second lane of Viale Ginevra be planned. Here we did not receive any answers. Hospital Street already has separate routes in the pandemic perspective that was so much talked about during the Covid phase and the same thing for the Emergency Room, we did not get any guarantees during that hearing. You were still asking about vehicular access inside Parini, will it undergo changes during the construction of Hospital Street? We know, at least that's what the engineer told us, that Hospital Street will be built in three sections, moving the current entrance to the Hospital from time to time. It would be good to have some clearer ideas. What do we know about 118 and their headquarters which is currently located near the concierge? English: He still wondered, without receiving any answers, where the underground excavation will be carried out for the passage of the pipes, which will connect the technological center to block K, whether excavations are planned in that area for the discovery of the stone circle, as indicated by the International Scientific Commission, whether the construction of another archaeological area is planned in that area, to be clear, near the sampling center, in case, as seems evident, there is an archaeological discovery. No answer was given to this and I am talking about April, so more than six months have passed. He still wondered whether the hospital complex, depicted as designed to position itself at the top of the parameters of energy and environmental sustainability, I ask whether at the renovated Parini, therefore phases 4 and 5, a photovoltaic system is also planned there, very high-performance machines and systems, advanced sensor supervision systems, efficient envelope systems integrated with bioclimatic solutions, we have not received an answer to this as on phases 4 and 5 there is total darkness on the Government's decisions. English: Since we are talking about a new hospital, we would like to have answers on these sectors too, but they have never been provided. Then the trees, the green area around this hospital, but where do you plan it? The only green thing on the rendering is the roof of the buildings colored green, but I wonder: does this seem like a serious hospital to you? Again: from the images of the preliminary design of the old Mauriziano, that is, the building that should be renovated and made integral as it was originally... I remember that the Aosta hospital is a fascist work par excellence, in the images, those few and very rare images that we have seen, its original identity has not been provided, so will the Mauriziano be put back as it was originally or will there be superfluities? Also on this, Councilor, it would be the case, six months after that scanty 31-page report, even with several typos, as we pointed out during that hearing, that you provide us with some answers. I still have a few minutes and I'll take this opportunity to talk about the parking lots, which have been reduced by 50%, I repeat, the parking lots are, from what I understand, 4.20 meters, know that a Mercedes Compass is 4.95 meters long, a pickup 5.20 meters, I would like to see how we manage to park them in that underground parking lot and we still haven't figured out where we'll get all the other spaces. A parking lot was planned in the south-west area of ​​the current hospital, now the technology center will be built, I would really like to understand, and we've never been given an answer, where these spaces are planned to be built. I'll end with the construction site, there's little talk about the construction site and it will be the big problem if the work on this site ever starts. Here we have a series of regulations to comply with, the regulations on prevention, on compliance with safety, decree of 2008, the protection of hygiene on the construction site is fundamental and I am talking about law 300, we have the law that regulates quality public works: 109/1994, which requires control by the Administration at an inspection level, for evaluation of the projects by the contracting station. The combination of the two regulations cited requires a preventive check to prevent the company entrusted with the work from blocking the work, rightly claiming the impossibility of accessing construction site areas for supplies needed to carry out the work. The engineer told us that the area designated for parking will be used initially, but I would like to point out to you, Councillor, you should know, that there is a regulation that regulates accidents and hygiene of workers, which, to be in compliance, will have to provide the construction site with a series of prefabricated containers used as bathrooms, changing rooms, warehouses, offices, meeting room for the management of the work, canteen, which in total involves the occupation of a considerable part of the construction site area of ​​the parking that was indicated to us for the first phase of the work. Then there is the quality control during the work, where there is an obligation, in order not to be excluded from subsequent contracts, to comply with the control and differentiated storage of all the material used on the construction site. This therefore forces the company to prepare adequate areas separate from each other, where to store everything, that are perfectly indicated breakages and defects of the material, etc. There is internal circulation, interference areas, loading and unloading, an impressive thing in that hole. You want to continue to build it there, you are stubborn, it is your choice, the people of Aosta and all the people of the Aosta Valley will pay for this disservice, starting with the same bikes that cannot even be brought inside the Hospital, imagine the circulation, with trucks that have to unload, construction vehicles, material storage areas that you will have to identify in some area of ​​Aosta, etc. The criticality is enormous, at least come and report to the Commission as requested by this motion."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,6,7471,"Before making an analysis from genesis to apocalypse, reasoning about issues that are not the subject of the initiative, in my humble opinion, and that is why I intervene in the general discussion, it is important to give credit and respect to a motion, no. 19, which has premises and commitments. As you rightly recalled, colleague Guichardaz, it is not your fault if the motion arrives now, but it is not my fault either, so I respond today sic stantibus rebus. On Monday 4 November 2024, a date that has also brought peace in history, the Regional Council expressed a positive assessment of the variant of the executive project of the fourth lot, phase 3, of the new single regional hospital Umberto Parini. With the approval of the variant of the executive project we effectively completely close the third project phase that goes to create what in the imagination of every Val d'Aosta is in reality the new regional hospital. : The fourth lot of the third phase in fact includes the construction of bodies K, L and P, therefore respectively the helical cylinder - which I understand some people mock, but which is in fact the acute hospital, with the conservation and enhancement of archaeological finds -, Hospital Street, therefore body L, that is the new entrance to the new hospital which corresponds to the current Viale Ginevra and the extension of the underground car park, therefore body P. The approval of the variant of the executive project in the anticipated timeframe allows the issuing of the decree of the President of the Region as the building permit, which will then be followed by the start by SIV of the public tender procedure for the construction of the work for a total amount of charges and VAT of €178,515,453.96, of which €143,944,169.18 are for works and correspond, after 7-8 months, to the update of the amount of €178,515,453.96. 139,663,000, reported during the Commission last April and included in the documentation on which we actually worked hard; then I understand that someone might think that it is a level written at random, but it was not. English: The variant to the preliminary definitive design, coming to the story, which you rightly start from the spring of 2021 when a resolution was voted in this Council and, among other things, was also voted by many colleagues who are not part of this majority today, but who at the time both the majority and the minority believed and gave rise to a series of absolutely coherent actions on this issue... The variant to the preliminary definitive design to the executive design was prepared during 2023, while the variant to the executive design - and this, colleague Guichardaz, I have already told you in response to an initiative by colleague Lucianaz a short time ago - was validated by the RUP on 8 July 2024, after what you rightly recalled had been concluded, that is, the verification report by the verifiers that had arrived on 5 July 2024. Consequently, the variant to the executive design of the fourth lot of phase 3 of the new SIV was approved by the sole shareholder meeting on 15 October last. Parini Hospital. The variation to the executive project therefore confirms the coherence with respect to what was declared during the hearing in the V Council Commission of 10 April 2024, during which the main functional and performance characteristics of the building complex were illustrated, therefore the fourth lot as regards phase 3, therefore the bodies K, P and L, the construction site aspects, the summary timetable of the main milestones of the intervention, which then, as just mentioned, and I wanted to do it on purpose, have undergone some variations, but in fact we are now talking about something that was concluded on 4 November, the costs of the intervention and the timetable in progress. We are therefore closing the phase 3 process in accordance with both the Council resolution of 12 May 2021 that you referred to, which committed to proceeding with the variant of the executive project to adapt it to the protection and enhancement of archaeological finds through SIV, and with respect to what has been reported several times in this chamber regarding the theme of the new Hospital. We have therefore declined what was foreseen in the Council resolution 1180/2021, proceeding with the preparation of the variant of the definitive and executive project of the phase 3 intervention. Once the new Hospital for acute patients has been built, the activities and functions carried out in the current Parini can be transferred, thus freeing up the current Hospital and allowing the renovations of the subsequent phases to begin. It is quite clear how the new Hospital plays a central role in the overall reorganization of healthcare, as foreseen in the regional DEFR programming, in the health and social welfare plan, in resolution 1609/2022 concerning the new territorial programming and in the new company act. I understand that in the game of parts, politics says that we move randomly, without a compass, but in reality these are actions, politics and the Administration reason in actions, these actions are consequential to each other and are fully consistent with each other. All these actions will therefore progressively reorganize healthcare, the networks of social-health, social-assistance and social services, making the models for taking charge of the health and social welfare needs of citizens and our Aosta Valley community more effective. English: As of today and until the publication of the relevant tender notice, as required by the procurement code, it is not possible to disclose further material as these are confidential documents that will form an integral part of the tender documents for the works, as we have also declared, therefore the project is the one presented in the aforementioned session of the V Commission. This aspect is not a secondary aspect, which, among other things, has very important technical connotations and which, in fact, also means that some of the things that were requested could not be given. This motion, for which we therefore ask for withdrawal otherwise we will abstain, has never been votable before, but even less so today. In fact, ideological positions may remain different, different from a political and administrative point of view: this council, however, has collected a vital practice for our community and for the part of our competence we have all abhorred the inertia that brought the closure of phase 3 home in three and a half years. We are not finished yet, there will be a competition, a construction site, the next phases to analyze and conclude, but to date we have behaved with common sense, seriousness, working hard and seriously, so ad maiora and certainly up with hearts. The point of contention is that all the things that have been said in the presentation of this motion are part of a recent past: from today there is a future for which this majority hopes that everything will go in the best possible way in a world that changes, full of risks and pitfalls. Those who still want to talk about things must realize that with November 4th we have moved on to another era and another phase."

I reiterate and repeat: that will be the acute hospital, it is not the hospital that the Aosta Valley community needs, which is also made up of all the other parts, because honestly, unless we think that from now on only acute patients exist, everything else must be there, unless we delegate to private clinics, I think you saw, for example, a broadcast a few days ago on La7 that was very worrying also with respect to this topic, but we will certainly talk about it in the next Councils, but, from this point of view, I ask you if, in your opinion, what you told us today is an answer, because I did not understand the chronological terms, for example, with respect to this project, after your answer, that is, did you give us times? Did you tell us: ""The Aosta Valley community will have the acute part in 2030""? And I repeat: the acute part, not the Hospital, I don't think you told us and, when we have the maternal and child unit placed there, when we have the psychiatry, what will happen to those parking lots? You have absolutely not given an answer to all this and I repeat: none of us is asking to have projects or things to disclose externally, but we ask for clarity, because you know better than me that having a radiology or two radiology units certainly has an impact not only with regard to the operators who you tell us every day that they are not available, this thing is said every time, so we even double the radiology units, then, by doubling the radiology units, we will also need, I imagine, machinery on both sides, which does not seem to me to be even of little importance compared to the costs that we have to imagine. Reading that resolution - but, as I say, I did not read it carefully because it was downloaded only today -, the same general director, Dr. Uberti, clarifies at the same time his primary interest in the solution of the residual interferences that may arise between the Viale Ginevra construction site and to the west of it with respect to the operation of the current hospital. He briefly illustrates the contents of a technical examination report that contains several points that, in his opinion, require further investigation: for example, very probably, in a hearing we will ask for it with access to the documents but having this report can certainly be of great interest, because Dr. Uberti's concerns are concerns that we have reported since day one and I am pleased that you continue to remember that the turning point came in 2021, because we, from this point of view, are absolutely convinced that the choice made in 2021 turns out to be the right one the further we go. Maybe in your reply you could also announce to the people of the Aosta Valley when the piece of the acute hospital is planned, in the motion it was also mentioned to have knowledge of the chronological terms not only of the money, so we know, and we have read it everywhere, that we are talking about 178 million for that piece, now we ask you: then tell us also the chronological terms in which this piece will be done and I repeat: a piece, because then everything else is missing. I thank you, of course we are maintaining the motion and we will listen carefully to the other colleagues as well."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Barmasse,Roberto Alessandro,1959.0,M,UV,10,4841,"I am speaking from a technical-administrative procedural point of view, obviously the Councilor has already expressed himself. I am only expressing my opinion, now Councilor Guichardaz at the beginning of her first speech always spoke by saying: ""But we will not have a single facility"". I think that the facility will be single, because there will be the Acute Hospital and the part that remains in phases 4 and 5 will be the Maternal and Child Department and Psychiatry. Once the project is completed in its entirety and complexity, we will have a single facility. This is obviously a good thing, but the other statement you made, Councilor, is: ""All health workers are asking for a single facility"", I worked for many years in the Hospital and no one has ever asked me for anything. Maybe Covid has taught us something, in the sense that centering all the services in a single place - I repeat that I am expressing a personal opinion - can sometimes create problems and maybe we should have learned something from Covid. There was also talk of a double radiology, I think that a double radiology - I don't know if it is still planned - but it would certainly be very useful because we could separate the services for in-patients and the services for out-patients, this could certainly bring advantages from the point of view of not having two paths cross that could create problems for patients. Which does not necessarily mean having the same machines in two radiology services with very high costs, but perhaps services and equipment that are a little more basic using the staff based on needs. The Hospital for acute cases for me is the Hospital, because in the future... but already now we should not plan for hospitals where patients remain hospitalized for months, so much so that the Hospital for acute cases, which I would not even call it for acute cases anymore, but I would say the Hospital, is related - and this is also taken up in the plan for health and social well-being - to all the health services in the area. When the whole system is up and running, the acute hospital will be a hospital where people will have to stay for as little time as possible, because we know very well that there are a whole series of hospitalization pathologies for which patients who do not require an intensive service should not be in a hospital structure, but should be in intermediate care structures and perhaps these structures should be in the territory for the discussion I was having before decentralizing the services. On the issue of having a hospital in the city, I think that each of us has his or her own opinions and they are all right and correct, there is no scientific publication in the world that says where a hospital should be built, whether it should be built inside a city or outside, these are subjective choices in relation to the needs also linked to logistics, the conformation of the territory, the available spaces, the occupation of green areas, so the methods and problems are multiple. I think it is difficult to say: ""I am 100% right and someone else is wrong"". These were choices, as I said before, I know very well that you, Councilor Guichardaz, do not approve of them, you have said this several times, of course, but to say that someone is right and someone is wrong I think is very difficult. This Government has made a choice, it is carrying it forward, on one thing I completely agree with you, the hospital facility is an emergency and on this I would say that this is what the health personnel are asking of us, at least these are the questions I am asked, in the sense that people want the work to start on a Hospital because they can no longer stand seeing this eternal excavation in front of the Hospital that we have had there for I think 15 years now if not longer. Another little thing I wanted to say to Councilor Lucianaz, who I saw has already booked again, is that you have reported a whole series of data and I congratulate you because you complain about not having information, but you also manage to find out the size of the parking lots. Before criticizing the lack of storage facilities for materials or medicines, of having parking lots that are too small where we should see how we can park the cars, maybe first we acquire the information, then we will make the necessary criticisms. I think that the spaces also for further services in the old Parini structure are large spaces, where we can imagine a whole series of support services for the Aosta Valley health system and support for the Hospital, this is my idea, but I think that we should always speak perhaps with numbers and not only with suppositions. If you also managed to have the size of the parking lots, tell me how you did it, because I don't know."

In the meantime, there was someone who said a motion or an agenda is not denied to anyone, especially when it is referred to the Commission, because it is in the Commission that the real issues emerge, can be debated, can be explored in depth. Of course, perhaps the motion's demanding nature could be toned down, probably with a minimum of amendment one could say: ""Yes, okay, we will go to the Commission and do the in-depth analysis"", which inevitably everyone asks for, because I just read a Commission report yesterday when there was the SIV hearing and the contract was supposed to start in 2024, but in February, so there is evidently a delay and these delays will inevitably accumulate and will continue. Phase 3 has finally ended, here too with a significant delay, which is certainly attributable to what has been found, to the archaeological excavations, to everything that has occurred and we will have to start phases 4 and 5 which complete the entire context of the Hospital, from the acute hospital to the hospital where there is the Maternal and Child unit and where there will be Psychiatry. Here, however, we need to give times, we need to give answers, we have asked in the past as a political force and also as a united Centre-Right, we had strongly asked to understand the times and resources that were necessary to complete phases 4 and 5 as well. The 175 million are needed to complete the first three phases, but we also need to understand the continuation, what it will be, what it will include, etc. Another reflection on the issue of the single facility: yes, they asked for it in the Commission, the medical unions asked for it here, they came here to say: ""We want the single facility"". I remember that when I was a Councillor and I tried to move the clinics away from the Hospital, there was a popular uprising among doctors: ""No, everything must be concentrated there"". So that's how things are. I believe that a minimum of amendment on this verification of technical-design compatibility, which no longer has any reason to exist in our opinion, but there is a need to have a general picture of the investments that will be necessary to reach the conclusion... colleagues, please..."

This is what the opposition is asking and this is what the Aosta Valley community is asking, because that is how it is, in every area, in every context, in every public appearance that we make, these are the fundamental questions that are asked of us. Councilor, President, review the commitment, let's go to the Commission and do the right in-depth studies, which seems to me to be a normal thing for a Regional Council that wants to move in the direction of building the future."

The way you are dealing with this topic is worrying, goodness you, we will talk about it in the coming months, especially the many Aosta Valley residents who will be called to vote soon, including those of Aosta, Municipality, will talk about it, and this will become a topic of sure public interest, as it has always been, but I would never have imagined such draconian responses from you. Goodness you, keep it up. There are delays, I repeat, the executive project was from 2013 and engineer Felli had planned to deliver the Hospital by 2019. This is the story and look at where we are. We will continue with this eternal construction site, with the poor services that many Aosta Valley residents know and especially those who work there. To colleague Barmasse I say: yes, the data, unfortunately I did not hear a single piece of data in the Councilor's response. I asked 27 questions, I also asked what the 178 million were referring to, you rightly gloss over it, keep going, it's your style, you don't give answers, not only to the opposition, you don't give answers to the Val d'Aosta community. It's your way of behaving, you spoke for over ten minutes without giving a single answer to all the questions we asked you today. On the fact that there are large spaces in the old Parini structure, I ask my colleague Barmasse to accompany me, let's go and visit to understand what the large spaces are inside the Parini, I only see that there are some very serious critical issues. You don't want to talk about it anymore, November 4th seems to be this definitive date, a crucial date, for you it will be an important date, it will be the beginning of many big worries for the regional administration I fear. You haven't given us answers, you don't give us satisfaction, you don't want us to talk about it, you talk about it to the newspapers and then we will have to do the job that an opposition councilor does. It's a really unedifying way of dealing with the problem."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,18,4130,"A clarification: as I said in the introduction, the choice was made in 2021, so in 2021 I said that I did not agree, I reiterate today that I absolutely do not agree, but rightly there is a majority that has decided to go in another direction. What I ask is to have answers and to have them in the Commission, where we can discuss. The same intervention by former councilor Barmasse allows me to raise some of the critical issues that I already highlighted in the introduction, the fact that not even those in the majority know how it will be structured, that is, the fact of having two radiology departments or having one, in any case affects the organizational model. We have just approved, and Councilor Marzi said so, a company act, it is normal - but we were also told in the Commission - that also with respect to what the structure will be, what the human resources will have to be, what the choice of machinery will have to be... they will certainly be choices that in some way... and we know this well because any building is designed and thought out also with respect to the organizational model that we want and with respect to the services that we want to provide, so in some way the fact that at this moment we do not know how many beds there are in the acute care hospital... then I agree, of course long-term care is a problem, but you also know the data of the Aosta Valley health system, and you know very well how long patients are stuck inside that hospital. We cannot say: the moment we build the acute care hospital, this will no longer exist, because then honestly do it as soon as possible, because it means that long-term care will no longer exist, it cannot be this even from this point of view. And also with respect to the definition of spaces, there is ample literature that tells us how a modern hospital should be made, that it should be within areas that are in some way not frequented by traffic, but this is quite obvious, just pass by there at six in the evening and ask yourself the question of how the ambulances - but we see it every time we pass by - should get to that hospital. Also from this point of view, if we want to get informed, there is ample literature that also tells us where the hospitals should be placed. What also emerged from today's debate, and certainly the commitment has been overcome, but honestly we are maintaining it anyway, since it seems to me that the will is to absolutely not come to the Commission, whatever the commitment is, there is no such will... the questions we ask here, what Dr. Uberti underlined in that report attached to the resolution are all questions that naturally should have an answer, at least within this chamber, at least we should be able to know what is happening. After that the choice is made, you carry it forward, because you are the majority and therefore you carry it forward, and I say this for this reason, but I think it was also seen, for example, on other projects, which he absolutely did not agree with, but, when the planning started, naturally it is not that one starts fighting battles or putting himself on the barricades, after which time will tell us if the choice was right or wrong. On this too, I will pass it on to you, Mr Barmasse, because you were rightly not in the Commission... but, when the doctors' representatives came, the only request was the single facility. This is the request they made to us, so this is what I feel like telling you because there is a document that has been filed with the Commission. Then you rightly say: ""When all the buildings are done, this will happen"", who knows, I believe that neither I nor my children will see that single garrison, but also on the timing we honestly have not yet understood even the timing of the expansion piece, let alone if we were to ask for the timing of everything else. From this point of view, I believe that even today's debate shows that in some way in the Commission we must confront each other, indeed!"
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,20,3662,"As someone here often says: ""I wanted to avoid speaking"", but then, given that the debate has taken a fairly general turn, as was quite predictable, it is right that the voice of the Lega group also makes itself heard, because already over time we have naturally addressed this crucial issue for the Aosta Valley several times and we have expressed our opposition to the construction of the Hospital, or new Hospital, as you want to call it, in that location, the current one, precisely with the expansion. Well, naturally the same positions have always emerged, but there are some ideas and it is right that we take note of them and also express our conviction. We have always been convinced - and even more so today with the times that are getting longer and longer - of the fact that building a hospital there or, better, expanding it, making that place the fundamental center of Aosta Valley health is stupidity, it is madness. It was confirmed to us by some who design hospitals and then, with little satisfaction, I must say, because it is never satisfying to understand that those who govern you are doing stupid things, we also read it recently in an article in the local press, in the sense that there was a nice article about a gentleman who is an engineer and designs hospitals, who is from the Aosta Valley. Naturally, since nemo propheta in patria, as they say, he went to design abroad and then designed the City of Health in Piedmont. The journalist asks him: ""But how are modern hospitals built?"", ""Eh, modern hospitals are built where there is greenery, where there is space, where there is the possibility of making a modular hospital"", perfect, exactly the opposite of what we are doing. Beautiful, it was truly a great satisfaction, I say this with irony of course, because we really understood that what we were saying, simply using our common sense, was perfectly spot on. Building the hospital there, at the crossroads between the two main roads of the Aosta Valley, namely Mont Blanc and the Gran San Bernardo, is a gigantic stupidity, but by now you have decided, there was nothing to be done. Colleague Barmasse referred to Covid, which clearly did not teach us anything, because that was the project and that remained despite Covid and you instead had the possibility of making a different choice using the motivation of Covid and you did not do it, so it is clear that the will is that, who knows why I have an idea of ​​​​my own, but I do not express it here, which however has nothing to do with functionality, with utility, with the real reasons why we should plan the health of the Aosta Valley in the future. I also hear talk of two radiology departments, instead of one, thank you again that we can keep one open at this time and I don't know for how long, so let's really say that everything that has been said and reiterated clearly does nothing but confirm the two sides, but here on health we shouldn't make issues of political colors, we should really only make issues of common sense and think that the health of the people of the Aosta Valley is the priority, together, in my opinion, based on my beliefs, with education, but you really have made the wrong choice. I therefore believe that even, let's say, the assessor incitements are out of place, those ad maiora, etc. I actually respond with another way of saying that the Latins had: che mala tempora currunt and then very often we forget the other piece, sed peiora parantur. These are bad times, but, if we continue to govern like this, worse ones are being prepared."

This 31-page document - of course, Mr Baccega, I am not saying this to you, I am saying it for the sake of the discussion - analyzed in a timely and precise manner, as far as we are concerned and also as far as the SIV, the Department and the USL Company are concerned, the phase inherent precisely to the object of the resolution of Monday 4 April, so, regarding the fact that the Government absolutely shared the choices - and did so in an absolutely preventive manner, another aspect that, in my opinion, is important to recall -, certainly in the course of the coming year there will be a whole series of aspects on which we will find ourselves having to confront ourselves also on this very important step that ended on 4 November 2024 and which will now require that the President of the Region decree and that then, with the beginning of 2025, we go to tender. The bone of contention is linked to only one aspect, on which however, during the various debates and the various questions that have arrived on the executive of the new Hospital, there is a flaw, namely the fact that from April 10th we then had the control of the external verifiers on July 5th 2024, a date recalled in my speech during today's general discussion, but also recalled during some of the initiatives that have arrived since then and then it was validated by the RUP on July 8th 2024. This postponement from April 10th to July 2024, which then led SIV to approve in the Board of Directors on October 15th, and then us to go to the Council on November 4th, is the only thing that shifts from a temporal point of view the documentation that was distributed to all the fellow Councilors in April of this year. In my previous report, and I say this again for my colleague Lucianaz, the cost of the works, net of VAT and charges, was also highlighted, which in this presentation was almost 140 million euros. The fact that it then went to 143 with VAT and charges means that we arrive at the 178 million of the resolution of 4 November 2024. In fact, everything that this initiative, which is absolutely out of time - and, I repeat, not through the fault of the presenter, nor through the fault of the undersigned -, to all intents and purposes, envisaged in its commitment is not only now late with respect to the fact that the Council has already approved the variant of the executive design precisely in the Council, but also with respect to the fact that the entire part that is being asked to be shared had already been shared in a preventive phase that at this point is about seven months before the executive design variant that is the subject of this motion went to the Council."

I remember that, when I saw the first project proposal, I was in the City Council in Aosta, it had arrived there with a huge papyrus and there was already that will to go in that direction. I hope I don't have the tone of a mayor that you sometimes have, but I know you, so I know that you are like that, those who don't know you well can also get annoyed in some way. What I want to say is that we had a report in the Commission by Dr. Galotto, who explained a whole series of paths quite clearly, I must say, and those paths need to be explored again in our opinion, because Dr. Galotto has now retired, I believe, and has been given a specific assignment in the logic of following the work and the path to building the acute care hospital, and also phases 4 and 5, I believe, I don't remember exactly the resolution that was adopted. So there is a need to have a discussion in the Commission, where it is easier to work, it is easier to go into more detail, it is also easier to ask questions that can also be technical for those who are not technical in that sector. We will therefore certainly vote for the measure because we believe that it is necessary, beyond this commitment that is a bit too complex, to go to the Commission and do a further study on the path that will lead to building the new Parini acute care hospital in Aosta."

On the other hand, however, the debate has highlighted - but the debate in the Commission on 10 April had already highlighted it - the need to meet in the Commission to discuss the things that we have partly discussed today, but which certainly absolutely must be explored in depth, therefore, from this point of view, this closure continues from not wanting to come to the Commission... you spoke about the 31-page document, I present 1: the one on the numbers of the hospital complex, there is a page to put this data. Yes, of course, it is a page, and we have been told several times in the Commission: ""No, but that..."", ""The beds... Ah, but you can find it in that little diagram"". Yes, we are told how many beds there are, we are not told in relation to the analysis done, we are not told anything, but that's absolutely fine. ""If we don't want to explore the issues in depth, rightly so, we don't do it"". We have other tools, so don't worry, Councilor, that the questions we would have asked you in the Commission from now on we will ask you in interpellations upon interpellations, this is what we can do, so access to the documents and continuous interpellations to be able to better understand where you are going, because, I repeat, you are going there. I hope that you are not hitting a wall, not so much with regards to your choices, but precisely for the population of the Aosta Valley. Councillor, I really invite you to listen to what emerged in a short interview with a pensioner a few days ago on La7, because we will talk about that and it is certainly something that we have been denouncing for a long time within this Regional Council that worries us a lot, because then it is precisely the fragile people like that pensioner who have to turn to private healthcare and even negotiate the price of a simple operation, so very probably we will also return to this issue in the next Councils, because things of this kind did not happen in Valle d'Aosta and Valle d'Aosta was recognized, because, from the point of view of healthcare, in some way we had the same treatment both for those who were in one condition and for everyone else. Unfortunately what we are recording is no longer this and we are recording that for a long time there are precisely the most fragile people who have difficulty getting answers even with respect to treatments that are not of great importance, but which naturally also mean that the quality of a person's life can change."

The fact that in a few months the expansion of the new hospital will be put out to tender, the fact that in a few weeks the President of the Region will approve the decree, will sign the decree... the day before yesterday the regional government positively evaluated the project and a few weeks ago the SIV Assembly passed in assembly what is the executive, colleague, and a few weeks ago the RUP validated everything. To return to the initial reasoning, the verification of the external subjects was done in July 2024 and the document that was illustrated to us for several hours in the Commission is practically the same that was approved by the Regional Council two days ago. This is to say that it seems to me that the Councilor has highlighted not only the path, but the mandatory technical steps that have been done in these 5-6 months and that the news today is that the Government has positively evaluated the project and that in the next few weeks there will be the decree to go to tender in the next few months. I think that we are not all technicians, we are not all engineers, we are not doctors, we have another role, I think that the synthesis of the debate... thanks again for giving us the opportunity to highlight what has been done in these six months."

The topic of the Hospital is a topic that I believe has been widely discussed both in this room and in the debate of our community. Here on my right we have the world champions of referendums and it seems to me that there was a consultation that had a very intense debate, very important and I believe that the answer was quite clear. The answer was given by the community that largely deserted a consultation, among other things, many of those who went to vote also in some way expressed an opinion contrary to the will of the proponents of the referendum. Now a whole series of initiatives, I say it, I don't know if I'm misinterpreting, but basically they are to delay and block the work, to then say: ""You see, we're not moving forward here"", that is, a whole series of initiatives are initiatives, in my opinion, specious: that's why I believe that the exhortation that comes from these benches to the Government is to proceed, it is to let the technicians speak, because here, I have to tell the truth, I'm also a little envious of some colleagues who seem to me to have skills that are above average, they are engineers, they are architects, they are safety experts, so it would seem that the designers, the technicians who have been identified are at the very least incautious, unreliable people, while here in the Regional Council we have excellent minds. So, since I try to stick to the things that a person of common sense highlights, I urge Councilor Marzi and the Government to proceed as they are doing, in a tight manner to be able to give a new Hospital to the Aosta Valley as soon as possible, because, if we listen to this No Committee, we continue to have chimeras, because we don't know where the new Hospital wants to be built, we don't know with what money, we don't know anything, but they are phenomenal at saying no. So go ahead with common sense, with correctness and let's try to proceed with the work."

I make a small observation on the things I have heard, it was said that the population of the Aosta Valley expressed itself way back in 2007 or, better, that it did not express itself because it did not go to vote. I believe that all those who are here, perhaps the youngest not, but the others certainly yes, will remember that that was the referendum of the ""broken pencils"", I think you will remember it; it was done, by the main party that at that time was at a different level than the current ones in the Aosta Valley, a campaign was made precisely to ask people not to go to vote: pas de sens pas de vote. The people who went to the polls instead responded clearly, clearly, and here there are also people who sit on the Government bench and who had dedicated a lot of energy to that referendum, then in the meantime they changed their minds and that's another story, but I would like to point out that 17 years have passed since 2007 and in between there has been everything and more. The health situation has changed extremely, there are problems that are linked to a request for better health care, and they are not small things, there was a pandemic that should have required, should have provoked reflections, should have imposed to stop for a moment and make comparative evaluations, because, if you remember well, when we chose not to follow the path of the Parini Hospital to be redone, to be expanded, we asked... but really every now and then I wonder if it is easy to forget things here, it is convenient, or if there is a deficit of collective memory...! because we asked for a comparison to be made to understand which choice, given that from then until 2021 everything has happened, that comparison that could have told us: ""It is better to use the money in that way, it is better to build a hospital outside, it is better to leave it there"", that comparison was not wanted to be made, it was not wanted! Because we did not say, when we voted against that famous resolution that led to the resignation of both - because it was logical that, if you did not support something like that, you were outside a majority, it seems obvious to me... - we did not say: ""No, let's build the new hospital"". No, gentlemen, we did not say that, we said something else, and it is not a waste of time to delve into it, especially after everything that has happened. Please, then, let's leave the 2007 referendum alone, because you know very well who was responsible for the failure of that referendum and I believe that, if 17 years later something like this had been done again, we would perhaps have had some surprises, because in the meantime people have perhaps also matured and what happened has left in all the people - and they are all those who need health interventions - ideas that are perhaps different from those that existed before. You did not want to do the comparative study, you decided to move forward, this is the way, but, please, you cannot come and say that asking to do an in-depth study, a hearing with all the documentation that is requested in the special Commission of this Council is a way to slow down operations. But what slow down? They ask to see what is there, they ask to take stock, but are we joking? What do they want to slow down? You ask to see, then we know that the positions are different, ours - and I am talking about our positions, mine and that of my colleague Guichardaz - have been very clear from the beginning, we have not prevaricate and we have not voted first one way and then the other. That was and that is, but allow us to ask to be able to see the documents."

Personally, as far as I am concerned, if there is a referendum, even if a person goes to vote, that is, he decides, rightly so, because he is the only one who takes on a civic duty and, if he votes like that, the others will have to suffer the decision. Let us remember, for the record, that about 30% voted in that referendum and of this 30% well above 60, I went to look it up: 63.56% had said they wanted the new hospital, so somewhere else, just to be fair. Having said that, things are done now, that's how it went, but I wanted to reply because the reply is always the same, it's time to put an end to this issue, because probably, but no one will have proof, if the people of the Aosta Valley had gone to vote, they would have asked for a new hospital, but oh well, if anything this shows that at the time at least, I hope less today, the party with the absolute majority at the time had a great ability to influence the electorate and good for them obviously.

Just last week, the dossier on immigration in Valle d'Aosta was presented, a document that highlights very significant data on the presence of migrants in our region and on their difficulties in accessing basic services. The dossier also underlines how essential it is to guarantee this effective integration and structured support to avoid marginalization and vulnerability among migrants. In light of this data, it is clear how important it is to reactivate the service that is the subject of this motion, because this helpdesk has the task of offering assistance and guidance to those who live in already precarious conditions, it becomes an indispensable tool to promote social cohesion and facilitate real inclusion. Even in the DEFR, the importance of inclusion was outlined among the strategic objectives and priorities of intervention of the majority, but let's go back to the path of this motion, which originated on November 2, 2023, then there was a new initiative in May 2024, precisely to understand from the Government what was happening with respect to this service and it was declared that 600 thousand euros had been allocated in the budget with a forecast of 200 thousand euros per year and that the service would be reactivated shortly thanks to regional resources to provide continuity. It appears to us that this continuity is not there, so in the motion we ask that the Councilor clarify a little the times and intentions with respect to the activation of this tender, assuming that perhaps we have not seen it and instead it has already been published. We ask the Councilor again for answers because that continuity, taking into account that the service has been interrupted since December 2023, I would say that there was no."

You asked if there was a will to reverse it, then you did not wait for the Chamber to respond but this to leave it on record. To meet the needs expressed by colleagues regarding timing, I will say a few brief things announcing that the Lega group will vote against this motion and will not vote against the issue of the hearing in the Commission, which, as we know, is the cigarette of a man condemned to death: you never refuse, you don't refuse anyone, so it is not a big commitment. What we are generally against is the principle and spirit that this service unfortunately has and it is something that we have reiterated on several occasions, because this service that we want to support and finance with lots of public money is a counter that offers services that in reality already exist and are available to everyone, that is, today the services that this counter provides, should provide today are already provided to all citizens of the Aosta Valley who go to any type of counter. Specifically, the ""Vivere Valle d'Aosta"" service offers the service of orientation and accompaniment to territorial services and support for social and housing inclusion. There are already social help desks, there are already a series of services that are evidently provided for all citizens and, precisely because there are a series of appeals and actions, I remember one above all the association financed by our friend Soros, the ASGI association, which obviously only deals with defending the rights of immigrants, at every turn, every time there is a public tender, a law or something, if there is something that even minimally excludes someone who has landed tomorrow and requests the same rights as someone who was born in this region or in his municipality and has lived here all his life, then ASGI intervenes to ask for equal rights, but the equal rights that are asked for on one side are not wanted to be obtained on the other, because here they want a specific help desk that only supports immigrants for accompaniment, territorial services and support for social housing inclusion. Not only that, counseling and guidance in the school environment, with support for enrollment, where necessary, training and work, support for filling out online forms for citizenship requests. I mean... but there are offices that already do it, if I go to the counter at the Municipality, if I go to the counter at the Police Headquarters, if I go to any type of counter that is available to everyone today, I find the same service. We sincerely do not understand why a service should be activated and financed specifically and exclusively only for immigrants. Obviously, with respect to this spirit, we sincerely do not find ourselves sharing the need to build, structure and implement this service, so evidently we will vote against it."

We are talking about structuring a desk with a dedicated office and broader functions than the ""Living in Valle d'Aosta"" desk, which only provided for a significant but discontinuous and lacking presence with respect to opening to the public. We are therefore working with a broader vision, aimed at characterizing the new immigration desk with a more solid structure and with more activities than in the past, in order to finally guarantee a continuous and qualified presence of the service in the area. In addition to the creation of this desk, among other things, the offices have worked on three FAMI projects - namely Fund, Asylum, Migration and Integration -, filed between the 23rd and 24th, which represent an added and specialized value in the commitment to improving access and the quality of services. The FAMI projects focus on three crucial areas: strengthening language teaching to facilitate linguistic integration, which is a project already underway; the development of an advanced data management system through a computerized database, which allows those who access the services to obtain personalized and targeted support, which is a project in the start-up phase and the strengthening of training courses and the recognition..."

The ambitious goal, to which all these interventions contribute, is to create an immigration desk that does not limit its functions to a mere point of assistance, but can represent a real model of inclusion and innovation capable of responding in a complete and professional manner to the needs of new arrivals and residents. To this end, the competent structure has been working since last March to identify a strategic and suitable space to be used for the desk. The goal is to find an adequate location that can meet the needs as a point of reference for citizens. In this sense, the offices are evaluating various options for spaces to be found both in the public and private sectors, but to date they are not easily viable. The offices are therefore continuing to explore other possible solutions, taking into account that the search for an adequate location for this purpose is not simple, as it is characterized by processes that require complex assessments and procedures that cannot be solved immediately. For this reason, given that the objective remains to continue working to find a solution that in 2025 will allow the opening of the counter by identifying the solution to completely outsource the service, it is a solution that ensures the location of the office since a future complete outsourcing means that the manager, in addition to taking on the service, simultaneously identifies the location of the same. The tender specifications, among other things, in this sense, are being finalized in order to start the service at the beginning of 2025. With the outsourcing of the service we have therefore imagined a new model that guarantees efficiency, accessibility and continuity, entrusting the management to a specialized economic operator. This choice will allow us to build a structured, welcoming and proactive service, capable of facing current challenges in a timely and professional manner, through a more agile and flexible service unlike the past in which limited resources reduced its effectiveness. The selected manager will also have the task of providing complete and personalized assistance to anyone who turns to the desk, therefore dealing not only with orienting new residents and migrants in bureaucratic matters, but also with promoting integration and knowledge of the territory, facilitating their inclusion in the Aosta Valley community. This means support in the search for housing, assistance in understanding and dealing with administrative practices, as well as job orientation by territorial, social and health services. Ultimately, this choice to outsource not only accelerates the opening of the service, but enhances its effectiveness, transforming ""Living in the Aosta Valley"" into the most functional immigration desk as a model that will bring tangible benefits to the entire community. What has just been expressed therefore makes it clear that the commitment of this motion is outdated in facts and concepts and, for this reason, we ask for its withdrawal or we will abstain."

From May to today, however, there was evidently no idea of ​​continuity, because otherwise you would have used those 200 thousand euros that you put in the budget for this year, in the meantime that the broader vision that you spoke to us about could have been put into practice, instead we see that in essence this Government, which claims to be progressive, perhaps has very little of the progressive."
47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,14755,"Let's get back to the topic of the management of the dog kennel and cat shelter. I would like to point out that this morning, regarding the controversial issue of the hospital, Councilor Marzi had the opportunity to state that they, as a government, do not proceed randomly, as they say nowadays, a bit like that by trial and error, and that they are consistent in their actions. I fear, Councilor, today, that I will have to contradict you with documents in hand regarding this very topic, the management of the dog kennel and cat shelter; a question that we had already raised in unsuspecting times, because it was spring and we were asking for news, through an interpellation, of the Government's willingness to address the issue of the management of the dog kennel and cat shelter, knowing that at the end of this year the agreement in place with an animal rights association, the one currently in place, would expire. Well, the answer was not given to us by the Councilor, who unfortunately was not present at the time due to health problems, but by President Testolin, who told us that the offices were evaluating what to do. Then, in the summer, we understood what the result of this assessment of what to do was, because the Regional Council, with resolution 952 of 12 August 2024, which bears the title ""Approval of the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the Regional Administration for the three-year period 2024-2026, approved with DGR 276/2024, with the management service of the regional dog and cat shelter"", precisely, in fact acknowledged what the will was, what the technical-administrative, but also political, line was to follow. Then we had other initiatives, precisely after the summer, after this resolution of the Council, in which it was made clear to us that it had been decided to no longer entrust this service to animal rights associations, but to proceed with a tender, pursuant to the procurement code, and then this fact was further explained. Naturally this motion was launched and postponed several times, as we know, for various reasons, and then also in the DEFR it was made explicit by the Government, this desire to proceed not with direct assignment as had been done previously, but through a tender was made explicit. The response in this regard, which also came from the Assessor, was that ""it should be done this way"", ""it's better this way"", ""it's more transparent"", the concept of rotation etc., etc. In reality it is not like that at all. It is not like that, as we will try to demonstrate to you, with documents in hand, today. And a huge contradiction emerges in the actions of the current Government. So, the assignment of the management service of the regional dog and cat shelter is due to expire on 31 December of this year. There is a government press release announcing the intention to proceed with a tender pursuant to the public procurement code for the assignment of this service for the next three years, that is 2025-2027, and precisely, given resolution 952 that I just mentioned, with which we proceed with the integration of the purchase program of goods and services of the Regional Administration for the three-year period 2024-2026 with an allocation, allocating sums of one and a half million euros, therefore they are not even negligible sums, and considering that this motivation, this resolution, we had already raised this fact a bit like this, in the heat of the moment, at the time of the last intervention in... I think it was September, let's say that this resolution at a certain point like this, badly, as they say today, says: ""Considering that the competent offices of the prevention, public health, veterinary and food safety structure have assessed whether to proceed, for the next three years, with the assignment of the service in question pursuant to legislative decree 36/23, that is the procurement code; deemed - he continues - therefore necessary for the reasons given above... "". Here, there are no reasons, that is, having evaluated does not mean that it is a reason, this, in terms of administrative law, is a classic non-existent reason or, if we want, sometimes some judges call it apparent. There is a fake reason, because you cannot tell me that you evaluated and therefore you do this; you have to tell me what you evaluated and why you evaluated. But this becomes much more relevant if we put this resolution and another resolution of this same Government in the background, the one of December 6, 2021, where instead the agreement between the Region and the Association that currently manages it was approved; and here it is motivated, it is well motivated. Also because this resolution tells us many things: it tells us, first of all, for example, that the law clearly provides for it, but we recall it just for everyone's memory, that is, we recall ourselves, as they say, but also because I think that many of you will not have been very interested in this topic, but the management service, precisely, of kennels and catteries can be entrusted to zoophilic, animal rights and protectionist bodies and associations; moreover, we will see later, even the rules or circulars of the ministry, as a priority, say... there is the law, precisely the 281 that says it, then it says this, I am quoting precisely the passages of this resolution of this same Government of 2021: ""Considering that pursuant to article 24, paragraph four, of the regional law of 07/30/2010 - our law on pets - the activity carried out within the scope of the aforementioned agreements can only give rise to the reimbursement of expenses actually incurred for the non-health management of the kennel"", so for a non-health aspect only reimbursement of expenses eh, because there is a health part, a non-health part in the management of these organs, of these kennels and catteries. ""Considered therefore - he continues, cutting some parts - on the basis of these considerations, that the management of the kennel and cattery - attention, this is the key step, one of the key steps - by the Regional Administration should not be entrusted taking into account only the costs, but also the welfare of the animals, including not only their living conditions in the structures that host them, but all the various activities aimed at their entrustment and the relative control, as well as the dissemination of the culture of their respect"". Here, this is the fundamental aspect, because the laws that govern this matter, all the administrative provisions that govern these matters, are not based on a simple question of costs, of evaluations, as is done to sell goods or entrust services, it is not this; pets are something else, they are animals, in fact, and must be treated differently from any other product. And then this resolution says again, always a very interesting part: ""Recalling the circular of the Ministry of Health, dated May 14, 2005, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 - the national law on pets - which provides that agreements for the management of kennels and catteries must be granted as a priority to associations or entities with the purpose of protecting animals"". And then it continues, I'll explain it again, acknowledging another issue that is important for the purposes of our discussion, our treatment, that is, this resolution says again, something equally sacrosanct: ""Having taken note that, pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 7, of Regional Law 16/2005 - the one on voluntary associations etc. - voluntary organizations cannot participate in the public tender procedure relating to the awarding of public contracts for works, services or supplies"". Here, then, we close the circle: on the one hand, the rules on the matter tell us that when we deal with this matter, we must not only look at the appearance and the economic account and, therefore, things that can be clearly identified in a contract, it becomes difficult to identify in a contract how much you love animals, this is a bit difficult, I think, to be codified. So, here, putting all these pieces together, we arrive at the fact that we absolutely believe: that by choosing this path of making a tender, we evidently necessarily exclude the voluntary associations, which instead are those that have dealt with it up to now, and excellently I would say, also because (and here another contradiction arises) then that resolution, which we cited 2021, what does it still say about who is managing and is still managing today? In the spirit of giving continuity to the management, pursuing the priority objectives of protecting animal welfare and spreading the correct human-animal relationship, it signaled the need to review some points of the current convention. ""Considering that the Association Valdôtaine etc. etc. has managed the regional dog and cat shelter from 1989 to today, thus gaining considerable experience in this area; given that the competent public health and veterinary hygiene structure has analyzed the positive trend of the management of the regional dog and cat shelter entrusted to A.VA.P.A ONLUS etc., in the last two years of management from which the average number of animals hosted and the adoptions of the specimens returned to their owners are highlighted"". So this is the non-health part, and there is the whole table with the numbers: how many animals entered, how many animals were entrusted to, how many were placed, given up for adoption, etc., saying ""Ah, these did well, they are doing well"". Now we ask ourselves why the government has completely changed direction without saying why. This is where the critical issues arise, because if you don't tell me why two years ago everything was going very well, it was managed well, the service had to be based on issues that are not only economic, technical, etc., but precisely on those that are the correct principles, I would say, that are more than shareable, that is, those of treating animals well, of loving animals, of also doing additional and unpaid work, obviously, to try to place animals in need, puppies, etc., that need to find a family; now instead we move to a commercial criterion, we hold a tender and why do we hold a tender? Do you think there is some company, some LLC? or some cooperative, perhaps, that can do better? Not volunteers though, eh, people who do it to earn money, more or less, or maybe even to underpay those who then make you work. This is a problem, so something is not working. There are various problems in this decision, there are technical-administrative, legal problems, because we have seen that, by doing so, we go against principles that are in any case established by the law, that of entrusting priority to animal rights associations and, moreover, I open a parenthesis, it was also confirmed to us by the Councilor in his last speech in September, who told us that before there was only one, that one, now there are three; three are better, there is more competition, there will be the possibility of choosing who to entrust it to, right? Indeed... if by chance they all three say we are not in agreement, then another path will have to be chosen, but in reality the law in this regard also says that the management of dog and cat shelters should be direct, that is, done by the Municipalities; here we do it at the regional level, but by the Municipalities, therefore by the public body and alternatively, instead, therefore in second place, entrust to other subjects, primarily to voluntary associations. Here instead we are at the third solution: we make a tender as if it were any service, as if it were building a dog house, it is not this... the kennel and cattery are not that, it is something else much more important and much fuller. So this is the technical-legal aspect, then there is the one of merit: precisely, we have seen and I have listed for you now what the contradiction is, on the one hand in saying two years ago it is fine, it is fine managed like this, there is the health part, but there is the non-health part that is excluded and which among other things provides for the reimbursement only of costs and, now, without telling me why, it changes, the path is changed completely, that's it. And then there is clearly a political evaluation. Because this choice is clearly a political choice, one of two things, I think about this political topic: either, dear Councillor, you are letting someone else carry you - it is inevitable to think this, given that you have not given a reason - or, I don't know, someone has already thought of some cooperative; I don't know this, but you understand that it makes you think badly when there are so many elements put together. Many clues make a proof and therefore this scares me a lot. We therefore believe that, despite what you have said and written, despite what you have also established in the DEFR, perhaps it would be very appropriate to reflect again on this decision - which seems completely inappropriate to me - to proceed with a tender instead of referring, as always, to those who have done well; I am not saying that they are those who are already there now, anyone else, but an association of animal rights activists who do it with a vision, with purposes other than purely profit. So, the motion (I read the commitment, naturally reserving the right to intervene later): ""the Regional Council commits the Regional Government to revoke, even in self-regulation, the decision to proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023 to reach the identification - I say in self-regulation because in my opinion this choice is also illegitimate from an administrative point of view anyway - to reach the identification of the entity to which to entrust the management of the regional dog and cat shelter, excluding volunteer organizations from the possibility of becoming the trustees of such management; proceed to the identification of the entity to which to entrust the management of the regional dog and cat shelter, in compliance with the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Minister of Health dated 4 May 2000, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 and only secondarily, in the absence of interested volunteer associations, proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023"". Of course, it is evident, if you do not want to do it directly, if those questioned first say ""we are not interested"", then you should act directly, if you do not want to do it directly, you should then resort to outsourcing; but that should be, as I said before, the last residual choice: volunteers first."
47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6944,"Dear colleague Sammaritani, colleague Councilor, not a lawyer, because I cannot be a lawyer, I do not have the qualifications, the skills, the competences; however, as you often point out, here we are doing politics, so I am absolutely certain that, beyond the disquisitions in the style of foil, sabre, fencing, punches, you decide, on the current rules we are absolutely certain that both you and the Chamber cannot but share the ever-appropriate orientation that identifies in an open tender the most suitable administrative path to guarantee the continuity of the continuation of the service. It is mandatory to abstain from this initiative, especially because, as already highlighted, with respect to a situation that currently sees at least three animal rights associations in the regional territory, and no longer a single association, as recalled in the 2021 resolution that you recall, and therefore one must consider, in addition to the fact that there are three animal rights associations, also the significant economic amount of remuneration for the service, equal to 1.5 million euros over the three-year period, i.e. 500,000 euros per year, a figure that is well above the thresholds for direct assignment of services currently set at 140,000 euros, but you know this better than I do. However, it is not clear why and how the rumor spread that voluntary associations cannot participate in the tender, as recalled; in reality, they can participate indeed, as provided for by article 100 of decree 36 of 2023, which provides this possibility to subjects who have already had experiences, with a positive outcome, with public or private subjects, such as voluntary associations. We therefore confirm what has already been reported on the intention of this Administration to announce a European tender, with an open procedure with a single lot for the assignment of the management of the regional dog and cat shelter; also because this is the only viable path for an Administration that wants to survive and do the right thing for the community on this issue. The procedure will therefore be carried out by virtue of the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, naturally pursuant to the contract code, therefore evaluated on the basis of the best quality/price ratio, compared to the proposed cost for the management of the service, which will certainly take into consideration the proven previous experience in the management of public dog and cat shelters. In open procedures, voluntary associations are also considered economic operators, authorised by the law to provide services and carry out economic activities; therefore, they are part of the list of subjects to which public contracts can be awarded, as provided for in European law. In line with the aim of guaranteeing the highest quality of service, the Regional Administration will not proceed with the award if no offer is found to be convenient or suitable with respect to the service object of the contract, in the full interest of the well-being of the dogs and cats hosted within the regional kennel and cattery. It should also be specified that the tender notice will certainly respect the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Ministry of Health that you referred to; this criterion, if the management is entrusted to a subject other than an animal rights association that is not able to guarantee the animals with its own internal resources an adequate physical activity and socialization, as provided for by the regulations in force, establishes, in the principle of guarantee, the entry into the kennels to animal rights associations. This comparison perhaps also allows us to clarify that the European regulation surpasses the national law, allowing everyone to participate in public tenders; it therefore also surpasses regional law 16 of 2005 (regulation of volunteering and associations for social promotion) which, in article 8, provides that organizations cannot participate in public tender procedures relating to the awarding of public contracts for works, services and supplies. National legislation, especially European procurement legislation, has in fact legislated differently; it is possible that the associations involved have taken this regional law as their only reference, thus feeling excluded, but this is not the case and has never been the case. What has always been the case, however, is to distinguish the role of manager of a public space and public money from the role of volunteer organization, for the protection of the service provided, of the animals involved and also of the animal rights organizations involved. English: Colleague Sammaritani, of course I also said that we will ask to withdraw the initiative otherwise we will abstain; in my opinion it is absolutely important to make a distinction on this issue, because, in addition to aspects of an administrative nature, which are used to deal with the issue, behind all this there are more than legitimate but purely political motivations; those who are involved pro tempore in the management of this department, but also in the task of having to interact with the subjects who manage it, are perfectly aware that behind this world there is a world that, so to speak, moves, shouts, seeks contacts, confirmations, which at this moment should be absolutely serene. So we, as a Government, not only represent the fact that the choice that was made with the acts is correct, it is a transparent choice and it is the only possible one, because you understand well that there are absolutely legitimate motivations that led to the then act of 2021. Motivations that were fundamentally based on the presence in this region of a single voluntary association: a more than legitimate choice; as of today, this is no longer allowed. A figure of this kind, by the way, there is no need for a poor, chubby, bald idiot like me to come and represent it to a lawyer; it is also linked afterwards to the figure that in effect, how can I say, someone... can I do auto body shaming? I heard, it is called autoironia in Italian. However, objectively speaking, this thing here also allows for an intervention on the figure, because the figure is an important thing, in addition to the presence of several animal rights associations. The fact then, after it was decided with a resolution to give a mandate to the single procurement center to include the completion of this tender within the services was also represented by the CUC as the absolutely most normal way. As already represented by a colleague of its group yesterday, it is not the need of this Government to give indications beyond its own autonomy and the autonomy of others, and therefore, consequently, it is not even the need of this Government to ensure that someone harms ours."
47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,4549,"I hope that in a politically correct century, self-body shaming will not be abolished or condemned, also because it is nice to hear it every now and then, so self-irony is always appreciated. Returning to the subject, I must say that there are some gaps in the reasoning that you, or whoever represents you, have made, because in fact we have never been told what should have been the assumption. That is, we are told: this is the right path, we are not told why the other one is wrong, the one you pursued until two years ago is wrong and that it should no longer be pursued, because in fact it is still pursued, so it is an essentially political choice, evidently. This, well, is fine, you are in the Government, you can do what you think in this respect, but the contradictory nature of the arguments - or rather, of the arguments on one side and nothing on the other - that emerges right ictu oculi , that is, immediately. There is a discussion over there: we do it this way because there are these constraints, there is the possibility of directly entrusting, there are these possibilities, they did well... then, as I say, I have nothing to do with this association and it is not said that it should be her, but I am talking about associations in general because they are governed by principles other than those of commerce or purely economic ones. All these motivations on one side and on the other nothing. So, in weighing all the motivations and nothing, you understand that it is strange to understand why and how to accept this obvious contradiction. This is the real issue. The figure is important now, it was also before, because it is not that we are deviating from that, a little something more in this commitment of these sums (we said 500 thousand per year), but even before we were more or less there, therefore over 400 thousand, so that is not even the motivation. The problem is that you are trying to support, with non-existent motivations, a purely political choice. So let it be said, let it be said that the volunteer associations... that we hope will go and do what they have to do, because that's the problem: you're getting into trouble, because now you're going to give it to a company or a cooperative that does things because it has a certain return, because that's the most economically advantageous offer, and then you hope, as is already written in the regulations, that the volunteers will go and do the part that they were already doing now, because they managed everything, and they will go and do it for free, etc. Who knows if they'll go and do it? And if they don't go and do it? I mean, these cooperatives or this LLC (let's call it LLC), that goes there because it's paid to do certain things, do you think they'd work day and night to find a home for a cat? When would that ever happen? Where do you live? What did you see? That's the issue, so you're getting into trouble for yourselves. A sector that is already delicate, a kennel and cattery that already as structures is not worthy of a reality like ours, which however, all in all, is limited and should have much more decent spaces for these poor animals and much more suitable, because I don't know who went to see, but I would invite you all to go and take a look at where they are kept, with much love I must say from those who work there, but certainly with not as many tools from the public administration. I repeat, the concept here is that you should not go and look at the tenders, you should not make these purely economic considerations: animals are not a product, I already said, they are not a service, they are much more. Their management requires an aspect that cannot be quantified, cannot be put in a table, cannot be reduced to a tender where it says ""You have to do this, this and this and everything you do is worth so much and I'll give you so much"" because it is not like that, that's why the rules are oriented that way. There must be a reason: either the legislator is someone who doesn't think or he made them for a reason and that is the reason. Therefore, to conclude, without getting too sentimental, but these topics interest me because I care about animals and therefore it bothers me when someone bureaucratizes this sector too and it shouldn't be like that, healthcare shouldn't have been like that, let alone animals who can't even defend themselves. Gandhi said it, that the civilization of a people is measured by the way they treat animals. Well, if that's the case, you're probably not very civilized."
47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,8,2957,"English: Colleague Sammaritani, Gandhi's quote naturally represented the fact that you are indeed speaking to a community at this moment, therefore in full legitimacy - and I give you credit for this, because you are very good at always moving along a line that does not distinguish when you are involved in politics, but you are a fine politician and also a fine collector of territorial presence, in this specific case for example - in fact, however, it is absolutely important, given that it is you who cited the 2021 resolution, to recall page 3 of the same, where it says: ""Taking into account the fact that the note provides, as the only association registered in the regional register of voluntary associations, having among its purposes the protection of animals, indicates to AVAPA itself which deadline cannot be extended"" etc., so, as mentioned, I am absolutely certain that you not only read the parts that you recalled to us in the Chamber in the general discussion, but you also read this aspect, for which the 2021 resolution has as its basis, for which it was decided to proceed with a direct assignment to the only animal rights association in the area, the fact that the animal rights association at that time was in fact unique. Today, this is not the case. I, among other things, have pointed this out on purpose, because you are a fine listener, as well as a technician and a professional, in all the answers I have given; I pointed it out directly because I was absolutely certain that you had grasped this aspect, I am absolutely certain that you also grasped it when reading the 2021 resolution, just as we grasped it at the time and have grasped it in the continuation. I would also like to add that, quite legitimately, we not only care about the well-being of animals, including dogs and cats, especially dogs sheltered in the regional kennel and cat shelter, because as you know, cats are in all respects the Mayor's property: we had a meeting dedicated to this at CELVA on which we renewed the documentation on the CELVA website itself and we had a moment of strong sharing with the offices regarding the future and present of free cats that are, in fact, municipal property, so it is also useful that in this sense it can be correctly represented that sheltering poor cats in kennels is not permitted by law for the well-being of the animals themselves. We care about both dogs and cats, and in this sense the sensitivity that you are referring to is absolutely married. I would add, however, that it might seem like a paradox, not only political but above all administrative, the fact that in a tender with several subjects, who could win it for figures in the amount of 500 thousand euros per year, a Government or any administrator is being asked not to call for a public tender, but I know that this is absolutely not your intention."

Regarding the presence of more than one association, I believe that this can only enrich the panorama, in the sense that it is true that an administrator says: sure, I only have one, so I wash my hands of it, I give it to that one (if it wants it) and that's it, but that's not the problem. I think that outside the Aosta Valley, where I have to imagine that there has never been a single volunteer association, the dog shelters and cat shelters in other places are also managed by volunteers, so much so that there is an appeal to the TAR, of which I had read a sentence some time ago, where this was precisely what was discussed: an association that had challenged because the body, the Municipality in this case, since it was municipal, had decided to put together various Municipalities, to form a consortium with other Municipalities, and manage it directly. There the association said: ""Oh no, you have to give it to us because it says 'as a priority'"". It was not correct, evidently, so much so that the TAR rejected that appeal, but it makes us understand that there are volunteer associations outside too, they manage dog shelters and cat shelters and clearly there is not just one for each metropolitan area, perhaps Lombardy or Piedmont; here in Valle d'Aosta there was this situation. There are three, I told you before, ask all three, if all three say no, you will do what you want to do; if instead one says yes, give it to that one and if not they will decide, maybe they will even form a consortium among themselves, what is the problem? The problem is precisely the merit of the matter. Volunteering is a plus in this case, that's why we must favor them. It is not favoritism of any kind, it is actually doing good for animals. Allowing these services - which are partly economic, quantifiable economically etc., and partly instead arise from love for animals, which cannot be replaced with any payment - to be coordinated. This is the theme and this is the vision that, in my opinion, a politician in this sector should have. Then you have a different one, never mind. Of course, we do not withdraw the motion."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8794,"This motion follows an inspection initiative that we discussed a few Councils ago and which highlights a problem that we then talked about later, that is, the issue of price increases. A question of price increases regarding public housing which, essentially, arises from a modification and a different evaluation that was calculated by the OMI, therefore an improvement of what is the structure, of the neighborhood, of the residential area in which some public housing is located, which gave rise to a series of increases that were deemed unjustified and also to a problem relating to the issue of heating, on which obviously ARER also played its part, also making psychological terrorism, saying that the fuel was running out and therefore it was necessary to save it. Net of this, the topic of this motion is precisely the issue of rent and I will try to summarize it in a few lines. What is the issue? The question arises from this: if we take a payment method... we are talking about the free market, on the free market anyone can go to the landlord and ask: ""how much do you want for rent?"" and the landlord says: ""I want X"". If I am fine with it and I have the necessary means to be able to pay, fine, if I don't have them, obviously I refuse. In the public housing sector, however, it works differently, because I make an application, I enter the ranking, on the basis of what is a series of calculations the amount that I have to pay is worked out and, once I am in, if this amount is increased I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of not being able to cope with it. Banally, I have already given this example other times, but I think it is particularly evocative: if I am a person with a disability, who receives a companion pension of about 380 euros a month and anything can happen, even the Eternal Father can come down but I still receive 380 euros a month, I will not be able to pay a rent of 390 euros, but not even 381, because I get 380. It is therefore clear that if my rent amounts to 381 euros, considering that I do not eat, drink, move, breathe, watch television, heat myself and so on, it is clear that I cannot pay more than 380 euros. Today, however, unfortunately, many public housing units are actually subjected to this ""blackmail"", because it happens that the people who live there see their rent increase, they see their expenses increase. I gave some examples, I have here another of the many bills that I have received, for €909.90 for a council house (one month's rent, just rent, is €909). It is clear that if I have an income that clearly cannot change, if I am an elderly person, but also if I have a job that does not allow me to earn figures of this type, it is clear that I will not be able to cope with it. So what is the means that has been used by other Regions to prevent this cost from arriving? Because the problem is that we have a regional law that rightly has its own article, which is 42, which regulates the forfeiture of the assignment. The forfeiture of the assignment is indicated - it falls within the category of forfeiture - when four bills are not paid, therefore four unpaid rents. After four unpaid rents, the eviction procedure begins. It is clear that if I have a rent of 381 euros to pay and I earn 380, as I said before assuming that I do not eat, drink or do anything else but simply live and breathe, if I have a rent of 381 euros to pay I will not be able to pay it, so what happens? It happens that I, despite not having the possibility, not the will, the possibility, I open my wallet and 381 euros are not there, there are 380, so I cannot pay the rent. It will happen that I will obviously accumulate a debt, when I get to the fourth bill, fifth bill, sixth bill - sometimes there is a tolerance, this must be said -, a dear little letter will arrive saying: ""My dear, either you recover this expense or otherwise you get out of here"". The person in question clearly finds himself facing an impossible, improbable challenge, moreover even in this period in which private accommodation cannot be found. So how did they organize themselves in other parts, in other Regions? I gave the example of Piedmont: Piedmont did something very simple, most of the Regions did it in fact; Piedmont established a series of bands (bands that we also have, by the way, we have bands), but these bands determine the payment that I will have to make; therefore, depending on my ISEE and depending on the state of the accommodation, I will have to be placed in the corresponding band and then pay a sum. Here, however, in the part of Piedmont, they do something different and, in my opinion, interesting and intelligent: they say that there is a series of bands, there are 19 bands. The first is the support band: a fee is established, the so-called due fee, so you owe 100 euros a month in rent, but you are in band 1, and band 1 is probably dedicated to people who have an ISEE of 0, probably (and if I have an ISEE of 0, it is easy to think that I do not have the means to pay anything), so you will have to pay 35% of the due fee. If you have such a low ISEE, you will have to pay 35% of the due fee. Let's imagine that the due fee is 100 euros and therefore you want to pay 35? There is no maximum fee with respect to income for this first band, but there is a fee and in fact Piedmont tells you: ""You will have to pay at least 40 euros a month"". This is for the poorest band. Then, gradually you go up and gradually as your income goes up, you also go up with the bands. There is the protection band, from no. 2 to no. 8; there is the stability band, from 9 to 13; there is the safety band, from 14 to 18, there is the permanence band. What do these bands establish? They establish a maximum limit of rent with respect to my income. For example, let's take band no. 8, which is a protection band: it tells you that you have to pay 75% of the rent due, so if the rent due is 100 euros, you have to pay 75 euros. But the maximum rent with respect to my income is that it cannot exceed 16% of my overall income, so if I have an ISEE of a thousand euros a year, I cannot pay more than 16% of that ISEE, but because objectively if I take away funds for that type of expense, I then no longer have the means to live, so there is a limit that is imposed on my income. Do you earn a thousand euros? You cannot pay more than 16% of your income for rent and so on. There is, for example, the last band, which is the permanence band, which requires the payment of 240% of the rent due (I imagine that the permanence band is for incomes certainly probably higher than 20 thousand euros, maybe 30 thousand, I don't know) and the maximum rent is 20% of my income, with a minimum rent of 300 euros per month. So, there is a table that also allows me to know, in a transparent way, how much I will have to pay and that allows me to safeguard my income, because - and I repeat what I said before - if I am asked for more than what I have I will not be able to pay it and we will find ourselves with people who are evicted and then with social services that have to take care of the evicted people who were evicted by the same Region. So we have a person who is thrown out of their home, who then goes to social policies and says: ""Eh, but I'm homeless"", ""How did it happen?"", ""Eh, you threw me out through the ARER"". It's a vicious circle that is objectively absurd. If I don't have the means to be able to afford rent, I must be able to have the guarantee that it is a council house, that it is not aimed at a market, that it is not a system for earning money, but a social system of protection for the weakest people; it is clear that this system must ensure that I am protected. This is why, with this motion, coming precisely to the request that we have presented, and we have spoken about it several times in this Chamber, colleagues have also put forward proposals for the revision of regional law 3/2013 and it has been announced, by the Assessor, that work in this direction is being done, the regional Government is committed to introducing, in this revision, a calculation method that provides for a maximum ceiling on the rent, related to income, in order to limit discriminatory increases and encourage cost containment for vulnerable assignees."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,11987,"As you may have noticed, colleague Manfrin, I have not given any credit to any initiative discussed so far, as far as I am concerned. This one, however, allows for an analysis, but it is an analysis that is also connected to the challenging part. As you may have noticed... I know that you will then hold the initiative, but when I have tried to explain to you what the object of the dispute is, you will notice that, at the end of the day, we are right not to vote for it and I will explain why. First of all, your initiative starts from a presupposition, which is that, rightly, of the Piedmont Region, to be honest. Comparing the calculation systems of the Aosta Valley and Piedmont, it is necessary to take into account the overall set of the two systems, and not just some elements; in fact, in the Piedmont system, the households that reach an ISEE value equal to double the limit for access to the ERP, must release the accommodation. Therefore, the beneficiaries are people who are in conditions of actual economic fragility and therefore, consequently, limiting the rent to a maximum of 20% of the income has an impact only on the households that are in the lowest income brackets, given that the households with higher incomes must release the ERP housing. This is as far as Piedmont is concerned. On the other hand, in the Aosta Valley legislation, there is no ISEE limit beyond which it is necessary to release the housing; therefore, if we wanted to apply the same measuring stick as Piedmont, some Aosta Valley families could end up having to pay rental fees well above those that you have brought as a comparison. It should be remembered, in fact, that our legislation does not regulate a maximum ISEE value for the purpose of a possible release of the housing in the event of reaching economic stability, therefore, in technical terms, the fact of not having criteria for permanence that allow, as in other Italian Regions, the release of the housing, but also of not having defined criteria for permanence. You know that one of the things that is being evaluated in the table that will involve us I believe by the end of this month, because the President of the Commission, in his attention to the topic, has given me some dates in which to call me to address an initial summary of the research work that the University of Valle d'Aosta is carrying out to arrive at defining the new law 3, so consequently on that occasion I believe that we will have the opportunity to address some aspects that you all know very well. Fundamentally however, to make a slightly more technical analysis, you know that, to make a long story short, there are access assessments, access criteria to public residential housing and then there are permanence criteria. On the access criteria - we have already said it thanks to some initiatives that colleague Baccega has undertaken -, what is becoming clear, unlike other initiatives that we are discussing in this Chamber, is that in reality the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta is not a Region with a broad hand in terms of access to public residential housing. 3 is not a law that, in fact, was going to deal with access to public housing in a manner socially appropriate to the times - and that is why we are changing it. First of all because 3 reasoned in terms of ISE and not ISEE; secondly, because, reasoning in terms of ISE and not ISEE, it also kept out of public housing a segment of the population with perhaps some types of difficulty, for which the work that this Council is urging and that we are putting in place to vary 3 could give positive advantages for the Aosta Valley community. The fact of having an ISEE of 8,500 euros - because this is the reference parameter, for example - could mean that with an ISEE of 30 thousand euros for a household of six people, in fact we would be talking about 9,375 euros and today with an ISEE of 8,500 we keep it out; not to mention a whole series of aspects that have to do, for example, with disability and a whole other series of issues that we may address very shortly. Coming instead to the criterion of permanence, we believe that at this moment we are the only, or one of the very few Italian Regions, that applies to those who access public residential housing a lifetime access, therefore, fundamentally, when the family accesses public residential housing they remain inside the house - leaving aside mobility, because otherwise we complicate things too much -, however let's suppose that a family of four people, with the adequate ISEE, obtains the public residential housing, or commonly called council house, let's suppose that four of them enter and remain four for their entire life, in fact they would have the possibility of remaining inside that house for their entire life; therefore, consequently, also the rents, to arrive at calculating the rental rents, would be rents susceptible to the square meters, the age of the accommodation and the OMI parameters which, at this moment, in that area of ​​the city, are increasing, as we have already had the opportunity to represent for one of your initiatives. The OMI parameters are obviously not chosen by the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, but they take into account what the market is for each area of ​​the city; therefore, if the OMI parameters in the area where the majority of council houses are present in the city of Aosta are growing, it is because, in fact, it means that, in terms of purchases and sales, in that area of ​​the city there is a market. That is. However, the object of contention is that if we have - probably the only Region in Italy - still a law that allows a family unit to enter ERP, therefore council houses, and to stay there for their entire life, even to be able to leave it in some way to future generations, you understand well that we, in fact, are accompanying the entire life of this family unit during its social and economic emancipation. It is possible that a family unit that enters public housing in 1980, with only one working parent and two small children, then, during the life of the unit itself, ends up having two working parents or perhaps the reference parent who grows from a professional point of view, children who grow, needs that change, they can even become income earners, in fact all this is partly not collected by the experience inside the public housing, therefore this unit continues to remain inside this public housing. Well, if we in some way represented - but I say this only for correctness of reasoning - the commitment of his initiative, we could even get to the point of making this unit, for a series of reasons that are obviously not the reason why he wants it, pay even more than what it represents today, for the simple reason that in all the Regions of Northern Italy there seem to be criteria for which, once you enter the ERP, sooner or later you also leave. Indeed, there are contracts for public housing with variable durations that, in fact, are renewed and I imagine that they are renewed by evaluating the criteria for remaining in public housing. Then there are still other criteria, which are applied in other regions, including the Piedmont region, which even tell you loud and clear, obviously not from one day to the next, but through exit paths from public housing, that when you get to emancipate yourself as a family unit, you have to leave the ERP. Consequently, when you tell a unit (let's stay with the Piedmont region), that it has emancipated itself and has become a ""socially richer"" unit, you also say that it leaves public housing. So then, in the list of the calculation that you have represented as an example of this initiative, that unit is not there, while in Valle d'Aosta it is there. Since I know that you are very attentive to the topic and that you also know it well, not only do I agree with you regarding the fact that the whole issue of blameless default has a fundamentally social reason, so much so that in recent weeks we have held meetings where we have also involved colleague Sapinet, obviously only for the part of his responsibility which is not the social but the structural one, but, in fact, we have also written to the ARER, recalling the need to involve the social service upstream of any choice that has to do with staying or not in housing. And this thing will have to be increasingly strengthened also in the new 3; it is no coincidence that we have been allocating funds in this sense since 2023 and that with the next stability law we are trying to make it - excuse the pun - stable. However, the bone of contention is precisely the fact that if one were to reason about the entire multidisciplinary review of this blessed 3... ...What does multidisciplinary mean? It means that the access criteria must probably be adapted in terms, moving from ISE to ISEE, this ISEE must then include a series of parameters, naturally secondary, which are then those of the implementing resolutions, which probably must be calibrated on a different society from the one that existed in 2013, that is 11 years ago, including the Aosta Valley one. When you enter public housing you do not have to stay there for life, but there must be parameters for which you must be accompanied to leave public housing and then, consequently, the whole other front opens up that we often deal with in this Chamber, which is that of: are the council houses available today in this territory sufficient? How does the management of the number of council houses and all the social tools related to socio-housing hardship fit in with our territory, with the fact that our territory is a complex territory and with, for example, the PTP of colleague Sapinet which, in theory, does not provide for zero land use or to reduce certain things? So this is the multidisciplinarity that we will have to face when we think about ERP, but this is also the reason why if we go to take - and I'm not saying that you did it, let's be clear - only a part for example of the choices made by a Region close to us, we risk then later doing even greater damage than what we are doing today, because in a Region that, like ours, does not foresee the fact that when a family emancipates itself it is accompanied towards the private market, purchase, rental or other, but remains in public residential construction, if we go to apply the criterion provided in the challenging part of this motion, we will in fact find ourselves in the condition of going to make those who have emancipated themselves today pay even more. Which I also find correct, let's be clear, but you understand that later I happen to be called to respond to initiatives where he tells me: ""It costs too much"", but it probably costs too much also because in some cases, because in my opinion we could also get to do simulations with respect to other laws, we would discover, if we ever did, that, depending on the Region that we are examining, there would be some nuclei that would no longer be part, as of today, of the Public Residential Buildings. For this reason, I also tried to speak off the cuff, because you appreciate it; in fact I try not to speak off the cuff normally, simply because, as you see, I spoke for 13 minutes, instead the times are shorter and therefore, consequently, in this way here I also try to self-give the Chamber a little less of my face and my voice."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,7163,"Don't worry, it's always a pleasure to listen to you, especially when you speak off the cuff. So don't worry about your face, which we won't body shame and we are against any work in this direction; you do it and you take responsibility for it with the Prime Minister. But in reality we are pleased and I am pleased above all because you express a political thought that reading cold notes does not express. However, Councilor, you said a series of things that led in one direction, now then, closing the discussion, you said things that are basically opposite and different. I'll start in order, so at least we understand each other. I fully agree with you, with the fact that our Region does not have an exit system from public housing and I am happy that you, in the conclusion of your speech, said that this is not right, also because obviously I was afraid that you would say: ""No, but we have to keep everyone and therefore we cannot introduce a regulation or a device that contains rents like the one we propose to do"". I am happy that she did it, because it is clear that we have the data in hand of what are the ISE and ISEE of the people who are in the public housing and if you, as I imagine, have taken a look at them, you will discover that in the public housing there are people who have an ISEE of 140 thousand euros. Now, you will understand that, personally, if I met the person who with 140 thousand euros of ISEE holds a house, a council house that should be intended for vulnerable people, for himself, a certain indignation I would show him, saying: ""But excuse me, but with the income you have, can't you go and look for a house somewhere else and leave the house to a poor wretch?"" Since he nods and agrees, then the idea should be that evidently a limit should be set, exactly as the other Regions have done. So if we were to just introduce an income limit, we could free up some of those homes that are currently occupied by people who can afford to pay, have the necessary means to pay rent and are not at risk of not having a roof over their heads. However, this reasoning, which you agree with, undermines all the reasoning you have made for which this initiative cannot be accepted, because we are not saying, with this motion, that in the revision of Law 3/2013 this is the only thing that needs to be done; we are saying that, in the context of the revision of Law 3/2013, it is necessary to include reasoning and a calculation method of this type, because if the revision were to include a clause for which, once a certain income threshold is exceeded, I leave the home, it is obvious that a table and a mechanism of this type would also allow us to guarantee that the rent does not exceed certain levels. If you focus your entire speech on saying no to this initiative, on the fact that we do not have this thing, however, Councilor, you are using an argumentative fallacy that is objectively very weak. I say and repeat: if we want to provide equity in the assignment, management, maintenance, payment of public housing, in the context of the discussion of 3/2013, the reasoning of setting income limits beyond which people do not have to pay because they cannot afford it, because they cannot, not because they do not want to, is essential. All this fits perfectly and easily with the two issues you have raised: 1) the fact that, once a certain income threshold is exceeded, I must leave the council house; 2) the fact that council houses have become hereditary, which is profoundly wrong. They can be passed on to cohabitants if they actually meet certain low-income standards, we fully agree on this, but that's how it works elsewhere, so it's clear that our system and our need to revise the law must go in this direction. However, Councilor, net of this and in light of what I just said, not accepting this initiative is wrong, for the simple reason that either you say to me: ""No, look, in the motion, if you want to make proposals, you should include your entire proposal for revising 3/2013"" and if you want, I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for free, without having to hire idle university professors who have nothing else to do in life except occasionally make charity appearances for photographers and maybe occasionally apply for a job. In favor of these, if you want, free of charge, I will be your consultant, at your disposal, completely at your disposal, without even taking photographs, I will come and be your consultant willingly. If instead the idea is that we have to invent something to reject the initiative, because the initiative actually has its own meaning and its own value (and you have recognized it), but I do not know exactly how to reject it, then Councilor I am sorry, you know that we clash several times. I think that everyone, net of what the tones are or net of what the ideas are, sometimes coinciding, sometimes contrasting, recognizes each other's ability and value, both political and of expression, we cannot however say on this occasion sincerely 1) that the tones used are wrong, 2) that the proposals are not acceptable, because you have recognized it too. There are no real reasons why this motion cannot be accepted. The motivation cannot be: ""Well, no, but we have a system"", also because, and I'll tell you more, if this initiative, and what you said attests to it, were accepted and a calculation method were introduced, which I have highlighted, which acts as a multiplier if the income is higher, as the income grows, the increase in monthly rent for those with a higher income would itself be a mechanism that discourages the maintenance of public housing. Because if I end up with an ISEE of 140 thousand euros a year and I have to multiply the rent due, I only gave the example of the nineteenth, that is the permanence, but if we want to calculate it up to such a high ISEE, I don't know what the minimum multiplier will be, 1000%, 2000% of the rent due compared to the basic rent, and when a person who has an ISEE of 140 thousand euros finds himself paying 3, 4, 5 thousand euros a month in rent, he will do some calculations and say: ""Maybe it's better for me to release the accommodation and find one privately"". Councilor, in our opinion it is not a political point, it is not a question of leaving a testimony, it is not a trivial question of communicating one's idea; in our opinion this initiative, objectively, has its value and none of the reasons you have communicated have the value or the possibility of saying that this cannot be accepted. Obviously we will maintain the initiative."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,8,2515,"Given that our colleagues have decided to maintain the motion, we anticipate that our vote will be in favor. There have been four years of debate on public housing, four years in which little or nothing has been done; more nothing than little. There is this process of law 3 that we have been waiting for for years. We hope that the law will arrive as soon as possible, because there are many issues at stake: rental fees, arrears, contract terminations, the issue of the housing emergency, the concept of adequate housing, the methods of assignment, the choice of housing... these are all issues that need to be addressed. But above all, probably, the regional tender must also be questioned, because there is also an interpretation of this regional tender, whereby where there is accommodation available in Pont-Saint-Martin, or vice versa, in Valpelline, it is assigned to the ranking and they are told: ""You are from Pont-Saint-Martin? We will assign you the accommodation in Valpelline"". It happened, it's not that I'm making things up, and if you don't accept it, you'll be removed from the ranking. But it can't be done like this! We have to be serious and the ARER absolutely applies this method. We know clearly that this law is not adequate, we are waiting for it and the commitment of the motion that was presented by our colleagues from the League also goes in the direction of making a more serious reasoning also with respect to rental fees: at this point, introducing the maximum text will be important and absolutely mandatory, also because there is no housing, there is no decent housing. It is true that a whole series of works are in progress, but we won't see them for two or three years, despite the promises that have been made several times in the Commission ""They will be ready, they will be ready, they will be ready"" but in reality we have seen very few ready ones so far. Housing is assigned that is unfeasible and is often refused, most of the time it is refused, and this is an element that must be taken into consideration. We will therefore vote with conviction for this motion, believing that this commitment must also be taken into consideration in the new formulation of the law, and we will be careful in this sense; and above all hoping that this law will be discussed as soon as possible, precisely to demonstrate what are the real and concrete problems that public residential construction has manifested over the years - because obviously things have changed in the last decade."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Di Marco,Aldo,1962.0,M,PA,10,621,"For a declaration of vote: our Movement will abstain on this motion, aware of what the Councilor told us: that this measure will arrive soon. And surely there will also be attention on our part, because it is a topic that is close to our hearts, that these rents do not go to very high levels. There will also be attention on our part to check that this is something controlled and that it is good and correct for everyone. Therefore the Councilor said that he will certainly bring the modification of this law and we are willing to abstain on this motion."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,12,5337,"I realize that when we speak for 12 minutes... and I am not of course saying this to you, colleague Manfrin, who of course must find reasons to maintain the motion; because the motion is a political commitment, and therefore, consequently, it is also good that there are abstentions and votes in favor. This is all fine, but what I have just said is what we are already doing, in the sense that the indications that have been given, and which among other things, independently of those that we would have given, are being collected in the study phase for the review of law 3, are those that I have represented in the introduction, that is, I have clearly explained the fact that to date our law 3 is highlighting: 1) entry requirements that are not adequate to those that are the reference parameters for a society like the Aosta Valley one today, that is, with an ISE, not with an ISEE, at 8,500 euros we are in fact going to identify a segment of our society that is not the only one that we should involve in order to have a council house. There are other groups, which are groups in difficulty, but perhaps not in absolute poverty, which should, with the use of the ISEE and not the ISE, be involved in the future law 3. 2) The next review of law 3 will have requirements that will include the fact that a family unit that emancipates itself, therefore a family unit that improves its situation, no longer has the right to remain in a council house. When this is possible, at that point it will also be possible to include what is made evident by your initiative. Therefore the motion cannot be voted on, but, in political terms, we absolutely agree with what you are representing and which will be identified at the level of law 3, because, to date, those that are the requirements that include that a family unit that is well off is already out of the ERP, are in fact not taken into consideration. 3) The fact that in all respects all of this will have to be managed upstream by social policies and therefore, consequently, the fact that everything that has to do with public housing must be placed under the umbrella of socio-housing hardship; therefore, consequently, even everything that is decided with respect to a nucleus must be included within a whole series of initiatives that, in fact, have to do with the attention that the Department of Social Policies is already making available to the reference nucleus. 4) When this type of choice has to be made, as also recalled by colleague Baccega, probably at that point it will also be necessary to take note of the fact that there is a need to have a whole other series of tools to be placed alongside public housing with respect to the issue of socio-housing hardship. Surely today, rental support is one of the tools available to the vast world of socio-housing hardship that is working in this region, and in the long run we should probably also make a whole series of assessments regarding the social emancipation of a family that has been in council houses for a very long time, but all of this, including the numbers I gave you, is a snapshot of what the 3 was not taking into consideration. If I am telling you all of this, it is because, in fact, all of this is absolutely in progress. Then I understand what my colleague Baccega is saying; obviously I cannot agree with him regarding the fact that, over the course of these three and a half-four or five years, no political choices have been made on public housing, but this is part of the different roles we have in the Council at the moment. What I am saying, however, is that, regardless of the assessments that my colleague Manfrin always sympathetically represents with respect to his vision of those who are also collaborating on this thing, in this specific case, leaving people alone, and instead arriving at the research studies, what we can absolutely represent is that these studies are from the end of 2023-beginning of 2024, so if we were able to arrive by the month of November to already have a synthesis, which has taken into consideration a whole series of numbers with a series of possible solutions, given that then after the research study that was commissioned to the University of the Aosta Valley also includes a synthesis of a proposal for a new 3, probably, without giving reason to those who say that we have done nothing, because it is not true, to all intents and purposes we would have absolutely already given very strong directions for the 3 to adapt to the Aosta Valley society of 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, etc. All that I am representing to you, obviously, is an administrative space-time perspective for different roles, which sees the solutions in the same way, that is, we all agree that the 3, as it works today, cannot work in the future and therefore probably what will become the new 3 will also have the possibility of exit or the invitation to exit from the Public Residential Building of the nuclei that have emancipated themselves and therefore then, consequently, also has the possibility of applying this which is what this motion provides for today."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,5316,"Councilor, you see, this is one of the few times, I must confess, that I see you particularly having difficulty defending a choice that you make, a choice of the Chamber, obviously. I see you having difficulty because you usually have a motivation, whether you agree with it or not, and, on the basis of this motivation, you try, in a different way, with various modulations on the theme, to convince the interlocutor, or at least the listener. Instead, you are already the third different motivation that you have given for the failure to accept this motion. So, you said in order: that this motion cannot be accepted because there is no rule that provides for the exit from council houses; then you said that the acceptance of the inclusion of what we are asking for in the revision of 3/2013 would lead to an increase in rents that would lead to the removal of people, that is, exactly the objective that we then set ourselves to include in 3/2013, people who obviously improve their economic condition. Then now you told us, Councilor, that what we are asking for you are already doing, which is more or less what perhaps colleague Di Marco said. So, you see, Councilor... Interruption off microphone No, I have no idea what you in the majority share, but perfect... I have no idea what you share: I listened to the declaration of vote of colleague Di Marco and therefore, on the basis of that, I intervene, if I may. What is the issue? The issue is very simple: that this is a system that works, that is, I set an income limit beyond which I cannot pay, therefore I have an income X, I can pay a maximum of Y, no more, because otherwise I don't have the money. That the system can be inserted in the perspective of the review: we do not write in the request that it must be inserted now, we ask that it be inserted in the perspective of the review. If you say that there must be a tool to first let out the people who have improved their condition, it is clear that the two things must be done together. So, at the moment in which you are introducing a modality for which people who have improved their economic condition must leave, it is compatible with the approval of this motion that asks exactly in that modality of concord, that modality of elaboration with respect to the new law, to also insert a new calculation modality. So that you are already doing it, Councilor, is not a motivation, but you did not say it in your speech, you said something different. Regardless of this, now you have evoked another issue, that is the issue of the study. I am sorry, I do not want to talk about people, net of the things that make us smile, make everyone smile here, because the world is small and the Aosta Valley even more so, but the thing that comes to mind, I ask myself: ""But what is the competence of the people who are elaborating these studies?"" because that is the problem, do you understand? Because of the people who are elaborating these studies, I would really like to know what competence they have to tell us what needs to be done. What competence do they have? Because if the competence is to be university professors who teach a subject that has nothing to do with public housing, I'm sorry, but unfortunately there is no competence, there isn't, and being part of associations or foundations is not a requirement that makes you compatible with the position, do you understand? If a person who doesn't have the competence tells me what I have to do with a regional law, I objectively and sincerely cannot accept that assessment, regardless of who it is; but if we take the curriculum, and we have seen the curriculum, we know that the competences are not there; and this is a concern, because then the effects of that very elaborate law will be discharged, exactly as happened with 3/2013, on the innocent roommates, because maybe tomorrow there will always be someone in charge who thinks he is a condominium administrator and simply has to harass people to ask them for rent, instead of understanding the social difficulties. So what you just said is welcome, that is, the fact that public housing must be managed in concert with social policies. It is correct, it is the correct approach, I completely agree, it is one of the few sensible things we have heard in this discussion. Welcome. However, the fact that all this is cited as a reason for not accepting the motion, honestly, Councilor, has nothing to do with it, it is not an obstacle, on the contrary, the two things can go hand in hand: the exit from the ERP as well as the setting of an income limit. Did you want to give a reason? Councilor, you failed. If you want, do not vote for the motion, I think things are clear, but this will evidently remain a stain on a debate that, in my opinion, should instead be a participatory and perhaps shared debate, because a law of this type will regulate, as you rightly said, the public housing of the future and we are talking about the fate of thousands of fragile people who, if faced with the wrong choice, will pay a high price."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,16,2178,"I had already announced that our vote was in favor, but the intervention of the Councilor somehow allows me to say other things. In reality, my previous intervention was brief precisely because we are waiting to see that holy document that will be called law 3, which we have been requesting for years, 4 years, and if my previous statement was that little or nothing has been done, then there are the data, there is my colleague Chatrian who is good and says: ""The public administration speaks through actions and the public administration speaks through results"". The results are there for all to see: there is a list of over 600 people waiting for council housing, a series of rather significant evictions have been carried out over the years, there are people sleeping in their cars, the rents are not adequate, they are rents that need to be reviewed, obviously, the condominium fees, for those families who are in serious economic difficulty, are exorbitant because they have been forced to connect to Telcha, this is the data. Innocent default is default that has been financed but, in reality, spends little because they are all households that have not had a reduction in income because those defaulting households are in some way either retired or unemployed, this is the actual data. This is the data that allows me to affirm that in these years little, or very little or nothing, has been done. In the years that you know, we were together, you will probably remember some steps, every year we assigned 120-130 homes to the ranking, there was mobility, and there were not the resources that there are now. If we had had the resources that there are now, we would have had a great time, because we would have gone to do a much more profitable job, probably the fifth batch would have been done earlier, etc. So these are the statements, we really hope to see that document as soon as possible to compare, to make some reflections, some evaluations on the new bill that we hope can give the Aosta Valley community concrete answers and update this data that I have given you."

In fact, just to make our objective clear, which was successful following all the collaborations that were there, our commitment included a protocol shared with other interested Regions, with competent Departments of the Ministry of Health, Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry, aimed at allowing interregional movement. Here we were more specific about a specific category of animals, which are calves, which is the one that, at the current time of births that there are calves in the Aosta Valley farms, needs to be able to transfer these animals to farms that are more qualified and are better equipped for weaning and for their breeding. I read a news item in a national newspaper and I report the headline that makes it clear: ""Blue Tongue: free movement authorized, northern Italy from movements"", this makes it clear the collaboration that has taken place. I also want to point out that the Aosta Valley, in this case, has acted as a leader to ensure that all this happened and since November 1st this has been successful. For this reason I will not dwell further on this problem, I will leave space for other problems, we withdraw and thank all the competent offices and all those who have collaborated for this initiative and the results it has given and we withdraw the motion."

An event whose gravity unfortunately consists in intolerance towards others for any reason; a distinctive and worrying sign of a historical moment in which the polarizations of society result in physical confrontation and not in a dialogue that can sometimes be decisive. Having said that, as for the question you asked me, I understand the intent in this case too, but the answer is already substantially contained within the question: the police intervened and proceeded to identify the people and the path that developed during the evening, and will proceed, as far as it is within their competence, to the necessary checks. There are no particular acts that fall within the direct competence and verification of the Regional Administration, so we are waiting for what will be the developments of the investigations, as they have been set up."

I thank you because obviously actions of this type are certainly reprehensible. We wanted to ask this and we wanted to ask for information precisely because all of this took place within a festival that is financed by the Region. The curious thing is that one of the organizers of the structure - we identified him thanks to a series of in-depth investigations that we did -, who was at that evening, went to great lengths to explain with the same post on various social networks how, in her opinion, the facts went. I really hope that we can get to a definition of what happened, but I think that the intervention of the police forces speaks for itself.

Over the last weekend there were reports of a further hitch on the bottleneck, an incident that generated a whole series of problems.

I had also reported that ATIVA had requested the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of the Environment for the necessary authorisations, believing that it was not necessary to start a specific environmental impact assessment procedure. With respect to this - I would have provided information in response to the question already registered under point no. 36, but we will anticipate it -, on 30 October last ATIVA communicated to the Piedmont Region and to us that the General Directorate for Environmental Assessments of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security had instead considered that the company should submit an application to verify its subjection to an environmental impact assessment, pursuant to Legislative Decree 152/2006, the Consolidated Law on the Environment; decision, moreover, which was taken by the competent Ministry and communicated to the company, beyond the terms provided for by the law, as well as a press release from Attiva itself. ATIVA, in the relationships that were held also with the help of colleague Bertschy and directly with the top management of the company, in highlighting how this decision could evidently lead to a further extension of the expected timeframes, necessary for the construction of the temporary bypass, consequently frustrating the objective (i.e. the construction of the same by the reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel), which would have been essential to guaranteeing us regular transit, also informally communicated to us this morning that with respect to this situation it will go down to Rome with its CEO tomorrow to reiterate its position at the appropriate offices and to support the bypass proposal which, moreover, had already obtained a favorable opinion from the Ministry of Transport.

We are talking about children aged 10, 12, 13, 14, who are being treated in the child neuropsychiatry facility; children with very serious pathologies, including syndromes, for example Asperger's syndrome, whose families found themselves, at a certain point, in the dark about everything and learned almost by chance that among the activities that had been proposed to them, that is, proposed to the children without involving their parents, there was as an activity participation in the Gay Pride. Participation in the Gay Pride as an activity proposed by the child neuropsychiatry facility; accompanied there. Luckily, some parents noticed and asked the educators to account for what was being done. The educators, aware of having been caught red-handed, rushed to cover their losses, saying: ""Oh no, but we were wrong, maybe we should have warned, we didn't know, the locusts..."". Moreover, some parents also realized why some kids reported... For example, kids - with serious problems - have been coming home, for a month now, saying ""I feel attracted to my own sex and not to the opposite sex"", ""I got engaged to my classmate"". They asked the educators to account for it, and in response - news from a short while ago - they decided to leave the project, abandoning the families to themselves. This is a very serious thing. I hope there are explanations for all of this."

To preemptively clear the field of any kind of interpretation of the ""Marzi thought"", without going into the specifics of the event mentioned, as already said also to the USL company, I personally do not agree with the participation of minors in events that, like this one, have over time taken on a political connotation to any political party and if it refers... Colleague Manfrin, don't make me such a fool. Or alternatively I agree with the broad participation in any event as long as there is no preclusion with respect to any political orientation, with a view to allowing the experience and personal growth to be structured autonomously. So if 1 is true, logically -1 is also true. The USL company, consulted on the matter, reported that in fact only one girl participated in the demonstrations, followed by the USL company service, and that the girl herself asked to participate and obtained the approval of her parents. Participation was then evaluated by the educators with the involvement of the parents, in line with the psycho-educational support proposed by the territorial education service. Some minors who suffer from neuropsychiatric problems follow territorial education courses on individualized therapeutic projects. These projects are presented by the child neuropsychiatrist and are authorized by the mental health evaluation unit. In general, educational activities in the territory that involve the participation of minors arise largely from proposals by the children themselves, take place in the territory and are agreed with the parents. The objective is therefore to be able to support them in their experience and awareness and therefore in their growth and in addressing important issues in a critical and responsible sense."

An absolutely necessary explanation: the participation of only one girl, it happened when the parents realized what was happening, because the group - as the Chamber and those outside know - was of 7-8 children; when the families, who had not been consulted, realized the activities that had been proposed obviously they protested vehemently and this totally capped participation, if not that one person you mentioned. That we must therefore get to the point of raising this type of issue inside the classrooms to highlight the sacrosanct right of parents to educate their children as they deem most appropriate or to ask permission from parents to be able to take their children to a demonstration of that type, evidently political, is absurd that it must be stated.

We were astonished by the statements of some USL leaders, who said ""no consequences occurred"", or ""I am quite relieved that there are no significant consequences"". I am not a doctor, but I am the mother of two children and I know well the emotional impact linked to a similar error, that is, when for example you have expectations regarding this outcome or fears, because that also happens. So, from this point of view, I imagine that there were repercussions, indeed. Then there is also an aspect that concerns the relationship of trust, at this point, between the population and the health system, because when you go to the laboratory it is precisely because you perhaps need greater certainty than the usual tests.

We begin by stating that all the results of the internal and external controls required by law, which we will describe, have given positive feedback. The complex laboratory medicine structure is accredited at regional level in compliance with institutional indications, including the structures that provide medical and laboratory services. The accreditation in fact implements the UNI EN ISO 15 189 standard, integrated by the documents of the Joint Commission International Standard for Clinical Laboratory and the Clinical Pathology Accreditation Standard. The accreditation, extensively detailed, satisfies all the required requirements that have been broken down into 8 criteria, 28 requirements and 123 evidences, all verified by the OTA, which is a third-party, technically accrediting body. Quality controls include both internal controls and external evaluation controls. The internal quality management system of the complex laboratory medicine structure includes a quality and clinical risk referent and a staff made up of referents for each area of ​​the laboratory. Third-party internal quality controls, those not performed and not produced by the supplier company, are managed according to the specific procedure called IOP 14 ECQI for both immunometry and all other areas of the laboratory. Quality control systems are an integral part of the tender specifications through which healthcare companies purchase the technology to be used, including IT, with quality control parameters that are tested on multiple concentration levels. In this supervision, nothing is therefore discretionary, occasional, sporadic or operator dependent. In addition, current legislation requires laboratories to adhere to quality controls provided through external quality assessment, a verification program that includes a control body external to the laboratory. In Valle d'Aosta, the evaluation of the external control body is carried out annually by the regional reference center for safety and quality of the Careggi University Hospital Company based in Florence. The reports of this external body are further verified by a Technical Commission for the organization, management, coordination and collection of the results of quality controls on clinical analysis laboratories. This Commission is renewed every three years and is composed of 5 members, part of the 5 specific associations for each sector of microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, clinical pathology, immunohematology and coagulation. For the year 2023, the external quality evaluation of the Parini laboratory ended on October 14, 2024 with positive opinions expressed by all 5 members of the Commission. Therefore, for what has been described, the USL company has an internal and external control system structured for the early interception of possible errors, aimed at reducing as much as possible the possibility that they may cause harm to the person."

The topic, in fact, has already been discussed in the Council of March 20th and, as communicated on that occasion, apart from the fact that the building is - as is known - municipal property, at the moment the priority of the Regional Administration and the University is concentrated on the construction of the student residence and the renovation of the Giordana building, which will begin shortly and also includes the construction of the heating plant serving the university, the student residence, the building of the Department of Economic Development and then the renovation of the Beltricco building. As already said, we are always available to discuss with the Municipality of Aosta if there are prospects for the recovery of the Arcate del Plot with a view to an overall enhancement of the areas, but - as I was saying - at the moment the priorities and resources available for the Regional Administration are those described above."

On the day of the inauguration, I left the exit on Via Monte Solarolo and the impact was truly dramatic: from a new structure, so pleasant, well-placed, well-arranged, well-made, to seeing that eyesore... Added to this is the fact that the Municipality of Aosta has decided to review the spaces of Piazza della Repubblica by removing additional parking spaces. We wanted, as a group, to understand if there had been this dialogue, if there was any prospect and you tell me that you have rightly focused on the student residence in Cogne and on Beltricco. We take note, but I believe that in the short term that should become a priority anyway, also because seeing those pipes, placed there like that, to protect a pedestrian crossing that is rather at risk, I don't think it's right."
47916,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Autostrade e trafori alpini",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,6328,"Councilor Guichardaz asks us about the news regarding the dossiers relating to the payment of the requested invoices and the concession for the management of the tunnel scheduled for 2034 for SITRASB and SISEX; the initiatives carried out by the Administration to avoid the closure of the Gran San Bernardo tunnel and to try to re-establish a collaborative climate between the two concessionaire companies. On 3 October 2024, SITRASB spa and TGSB SA signed the memorandum of understanding for the management of the assignment and implementation of the works for the renovation of the ventilation slab of the Gran San Bernardo tunnel. On the same date, the competent structure of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport was asked to appoint a Commission for the technical-administrative testing of the work and on the occasion it was asked if there were any developments regarding the procedure for the extension of the concession, indicating the full availability to provide any necessary support in order to contribute to the advancement of the aforementioned procedure. This note is, at present, without confirmation. Regarding the issue of the invoices issued by TGSB SA, the company SITRASB spa recalls that they were rejected with a request to issue the relative credit notes, as it was not possible to receive or even pay invoices relating to a contract announced by the Swiss company without signing a specific memorandum of understanding. Now that this memorandum has been signed, the mutual economic relations between the two concessionaire companies will be regulated, in accordance with the provisions of the said memorandum. It is believed that the signing of the memorandum of understanding can certainly have a positive influence on the relations between the two companies, although it should be emphasized that the working relationships have continued in the spirit of maximum collaboration that has always distinguished the employees of both concessionaire companies, in the interest of maintaining the safety of both staff and users. The entire infrastructure, to date, does not cause any particular concern. The third question (if the news reported in the article cited in the introduction are true), the company emphasizes that the article published in the online newspaper ""Laprimalinea"" on 18/09/2024 contains several inaccuracies. More precisely, it is not the company Cappi&Marcoz SA that owns 40% of Gran San Bernardo, Custom Service Srl, but Mr. Cappi. During the meeting of the Board of Directors on June 24, the renewal of the lease contracts of some premises and sites at the tunnel parking lot that have reached their second renewal was included on the agenda. This operation, although falling within the powers of the President, was brought to the attention of the Board precisely by virtue of the fact that the President SITRASB is directly interested in the matter, being a partner of one of the two companies leasing the properties whose contracts were expiring. The President therefore did not propose the renewal of the lease contracts with a formula of six years plus six, without an update of the rent, as reported in the article, but left the room, temporarily handing over the Presidency to the Vice President, engineer Federico Caniggia. Having collectively analyzed the situation in light of the majority public shareholding of SITRASB and taking into account the considerations also formulated by the company's lawyers, the Board of Directors decided not to proceed with a tacit renewal of the contracts and, also to allow for the appropriate investigations, resolved to proceed with the cancellation of these lease contracts, instructing the Vice President to prepare and sign the same and to proceed with the evaluation of the possibility of signing new contracts and according to which procedure. The Board of Auditors, having taken note of the above, suggested that an evaluation also be carried out regarding the size of the premises. Finally, the company specifies that a public notice for the assignment of the premises is being finalized and will be published as soon as possible. The fourth question asks for the position of the Head of Prevention, Corruption and Transparency with respect to this matter. With regard to the last question, the Head of Prevention and Transparency highlights that, together with the President of the Supervisory Body since 2022 following the designation of the new members of the Board of Directors, he has carried out the appropriate investigations regarding the existence of any hypotheses of ineligibility or incompatibility of the President of the office, also in light of the decisions of the ANAC for similar cases. Following these analyses, the Prevention Managers and the Chairman of the Supervisory Body considered that there were potential conflicts of interest, but with reference to specific, limited activities of SITRASB, namely the proposals regarding promotional pricing policies of the management company SISEX SA and the signing of any new rental contracts, or renewal of the existing contract with the customs forwarding company expiring on 1 January 2025. They therefore agreed that it was appropriate for the Chairman to make a preliminary declaration to the Board of Directors regarding potential conflicts, so as to be able to act in the event of discussion of the matters in question in full transparency with respect to the professional activity carried out, as well as evaluate from time to time whether to abstain from the related discussion and decision. These conclusions were the subject of a joint report in the company records, subsequently presented to the Board of Directors at the meeting of 22 July 2022, on the occasion of the installation of the new Supervisory Body. The insertion and discussion of the point regarding the renewal of the commercial lease contracts for the premises at the tunnel parking lot therefore took place in the manner already described, without the participation of the President of the company."

However, certainly, an unedifying picture emerges with respect to this society and in any case to the fact that those responsible for prevention identify conflicts of interest; even if actions are defined to be carried out from this point of view, most likely, perhaps, it would be appropriate to reflect. We also learn about the memorandum of understanding which is certainly a step forward. On the other hand, however, it is worrying that so much time has passed, but little or nothing is known about the issue of the extension, in the sense that you mentioned again a letter sent to the Ministry, but this too has not found any response, so I could also make the appeal that my colleague Aggravi made earlier: that those who have contacts within that Ministry could perhaps take action in some way, because I believe that the tunnel problem and the approaching expiry of the concession are certainly worrying and should worry all the regional councilors, because in any case we know well that there are also problems related to European regulations and therefore more attention should most likely be paid.

And I assure you that the Aosta Valley is also wondering a lot about this. The will of some political forces and associations present in the Regional Council, and also of political parties that are present in the Aosta City Council, to open a political construction site of autonomist center has been announced.

I am starting to ask myself a further question, in addition to those that my colleague Baccega asked me: whether the interest is an interest of the party he represents or whether it is a more general interest, because when a political verification is requested or a situation that must be analyzed politically and preventively to an act such as the budget, which in itself is the political act par excellence and therefore where a majority finds a communion of intent and finds a convergence on the document presented, I think that there are no major political verifications or major situations to analyze preventively. I did not speak of inappropriateness: if you allow me, I spoke of prematurity, if you like, of a path that, in my opinion, if they ask me for a personal opinion that I interpret in that way, I say that the paths are all possible. If they ask me for an opinion, I allow myself to express it in a temporal sense, in this case, because then I understand very well all the dynamics that remain dynamic, as I said then, to be analyzed at the level of movements and parties to conceive what the paths can be. I also said that, if situations of administrative embarrassment were to arise for the continuation of the normal course of activities and the government program that we have signed in 19, then at that point further evaluations will be made. Otherwise, I have postponed to the meetings between the movements that are part of our coalition, of our Government, of our majority, to a dialogue with the movement that represents the relative majority within this Council. So, to conclude, I would say that, in my opinion - then the Council is sovereign on these initiatives -, the document that we will analyze in the first week of December will be a document that will give the pulse of the situation and on what are the intentions of the regional majority and the univocal direction that there will have to be to carry forward what has been taken as a burden towards the population. On the two most specific questions raised by the Lega group, by colleague Lavy, when I am asked if I was informed in advance, it would probably be a bit of a question to reverse, in the sense that these are situations that you experience in the corridors every day, in the normal dialogue that can be there to understand if there are reflections to be made in the political sphere. As far as I am concerned, I am part of this world as much as you, there are discussions that are evidently part of a path, they were not shared with me because, beyond a mere announcement a few minutes before the press release came out... but as it should be, I want to say: these are choices that are up to those who bring them to our home; for me, what is important is to have a very clear and very shared path on what are the initiatives that the Government and the majority must bring home to close this Legislature correctly.

It is you yourself, President Testolin, the other father of this political operation, because this is a real motion of no confidence in you by two of your Councilors in the Council, who - we learned earlier - did not even tell you a little before this operation, you said a few minutes before it came out in the newspaper. Let's say that there is a little bit of rudeness. This was perhaps also the result of some of your attitudes, of your behaviors. We see it within the Council: sometimes you often have a centralizing tendency, not to say arrogant, on some issues, on some ways to carry forward. We see it in the Council, I imagine in the Council what the environment is with which even the Councilors perhaps have to work, perhaps because in some areas there is also a lack of discussion. There is, however, a doubt that comes up, completely spontaneously: that perhaps you have certainly not hindered this operation, indeed, in the end it is even good for you, because now you finally have a pretext to possibly return to early elections. A pretext that was obviously difficult to create in normal situations, but that now you have in hand and that you can obviously pull out whenever you prefer, knowing full well that if we went to early elections, you as a candidate, if you got a lot of votes - which I sincerely hope for you - could be President again; something that, if we went to September, you probably wouldn't be able to do. In the face of your colleagues, even in the party, who instead would hope that you could take a step back, a step over, but these are your internal issues. However, here are some reflections to be made, above all you, President, in some way reflect in a very thorough manner. Because this political operation seems to me even worse than the two votes that you lacked in the first vote to become President. Think about it!"
47918,XVI,06/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,1994,"Colleague Aggravi asks what type of assignment is that of developing the image, updating its styles and contents. With regard to the first question, Casino de la Vallée communicates that the object of the assignment is divided into the following activities: participation in the development of the annual plan for communication and commercial promotion, as well as the annual plan of events organized by the company for the customers of the gaming house and for the enhancement of the hotel facilities; collaboration in the preparation of the budget for advertising activities to be carried out through the media; collaboration with internal offices in order to evaluate the current activity and direct its contents, methodologies and purposes and finally, the formulation of proposals for new initiatives aimed at spreading the company brands, consolidating customer loyalty, improving the company image, enhancing the services offered to customers. The second question asks instead in which activity, developed projects, etc., this consultancy support will materialize. The consultant has already presented a work program that will have to be evaluated in terms of economic impact and cost-benefit ratio that develops a series of events and activities aimed at enhancing the history of the Casino and the Grand Hotel Billia, on the one hand, and to bring the Grand Hotel Billia back to being a place of aggregation and sharing of cultural and entertainment events also for the people of the Aosta Valley, on the other. Finally, to develop new initiatives always aimed at promoting the company's image. The third question asks if the compensation indicated in the transparency section concerns the entire period indicated, that is, from 1 September 2024 to 31 August 2025: for the consultant the compensation on a monthly basis is 2,500 euros, plus VAT, for the duration of 12 months, therefore for a total of 30,000 euros."
47918,XVI,06/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,4,2268,"I'll start from the bottom: actually, looking at the transparency section of the Casino de la Vallée, there was a doubt about direct assignments, because it reported 2,500?, plus VAT, charges and expense reimbursement. The monthly basis was not specified. Among other things, in hindsight, if the cost had been this, perhaps we would have asked him for advice to better organize the construction site meetings in the Pollein caves. I must say that, given the amount, perhaps he could have brought potatoes, saucisse and bodeun, because you see - colleague Baccega - when we arrived you from Forza Italia had already been there and had eaten everything. Having said that, I must say that the questioning at least shed some light not only on the amount, but also on what the activities are, because objectively in the object of the service and in the reason for the assignment there were some very vague passages, including ""developing the image by updating its styles and contents"", which is a great program, and ""coordination of promotional communication activities"". English: Especially on the development of the image we wanted to understand for a moment and we will do some further investigations because objectively - I don't remember if it was in the penultimate, the Council preceding that of the DEFR - I had already brought to the attention of the Chamber the fact that after the study had been done and the DEFR had been released, an assignment had also been issued for a consultancy firm which is the one that had already followed the study for the construction of the industrial plan. All this seems a bit strange to us because, beyond the fact that we need to understand how to implement the objective of the DEFR (we have already discussed this), understand how this primary consultancy firm can deal above all with the part of future development not only of the image, but, in general, of the management of the Casino, and on the other hand now we also find ourselves with a consultancy in this field, together with others. It seems to us that there is a very confusing activity. The only thing: perhaps, in the representation of the fees, where transparency is needed, it would be a good idea to make the transition more understandable. But I think that those at the Casino and in management who are listening to us will take note and make the necessary corrections."

Of course, colleague Marguerettaz interpreted very well. I understand that colleague Aggravi may be annoyed by the statements I made, but they are true and concrete things and the fact that he is annoyed in some way certifies it. We did not go to eat saucisse and bodeun and boiled potatoes in Pollein to build an autonomist center. We are going our way, we are going our way with the center-right, we are aware of the fact that we are putting in place a serious program for the people of the Aosta Valley to create an alternation; we are not going to make deals or electoral cartels that will then be useful for the future.

The second question that the colleague asked (""when will the draft of implementing rules on water diversion concessions finally be sent to the Regional Council of the Aosta Valley?"") I believe has already been answered, considering that on 30 October last the draft of implementing rules was sent to the President of the Regional Council in order to acquire the opinion of this Assembly. For the third question (""what are the actual administrative obligations of the Legislative Affairs and State Aid Office that the members of regional appointment ensure in the sense of the Joint Commission for the purposes of its functioning""), the regional members of the Joint Commission appointed by the Council are usually experts in legal matters, I would even say authoritative experts, or regional councillors, and the support of the Legislative Affairs and State Aid organizational structure is embodied in the procedures for the payment of the emoluments due to the members of the regional part, as provided for by the resolution of the Regional Council 775 of 2024."

47919,XVI,06/11/2024,"ACQUE, NORME DI ATTUAZIONE",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,3940,"President Testolin, I believe that it is absolutely not credible that with a regional office that has the task of following the work of the Joint Commission and above all with a member of the Joint Commission who sits directly in the Council and is the Group Leader of his political force, the President does not know the dates, agendas and meeting methods of the Joint Commission; because this is what I asked in the question. I do not understand what in all respects seems to me to be a reticence, even an omission of information, because on the website of the Region, under the heading ""legislative affairs and State aid"", at point 9, it says ""also at the instigation of the Chief of Cabinet, provides support to the members appointed by the region within the Joint Commission referred to in Article 48 bis of the Special Statute, ensuring the administrative procedures necessary for its functioning"". Now you tell me that the work of this office is embodied in the payment of emoluments! I think we can say whatever we want, but if the Chief of Staff has to give his support to pay the emoluments... it seems a bit strange to me! Among other things, emoluments that are obviously paid by the Valle d'Aosta Region, which has established with its own resolution these amounts that are 12,000 euros gross per year. Amounts that, in my opinion, would also justify a little more communication, at least on the agendas, on the content of what is being discussed, at least the object, more than the content, let's put it that way. We do not have the minutes, we are not aware of the convocations, you told us on October 2 that from April to that day, September 30, the Joint Commission met twice. So, if you know that it met twice, thank goodness you managed to find some information, perhaps by asking directly the colleague who is a member of the Joint Commission or the Minister of Regional Affairs or the President of the Joint Commission! I don't know who. Anyway, you told us that there were two meetings. It's a bit strange, also because you then told us something else, that is, that the implementing regulation had been approved by the Joint Commission on 30 September. Then we receive the draft, and in the draft that was sent by the Minister for Regional Affairs on 30 September, and then the protocol is from the 31st, the one that was sent to us, there is the draft implementing regulation and the approval date is reported - and there are no others, not even at the bottom - which dates back to 29 July. So, it may be that between those two meetings that you told us about on 2 October, there was the one on 29 July and the one on 30 September. But there is a problem, because, as I was saying, if the approval date is 29 July, three months have passed from the approval to the transmission of the draft implementing regulation. If it had been approved on 30 September, a month would have passed anyway, and that seems like a long time to me; if instead the approval had occurred on October 14, as I have already told you once, since we have a different date, then perhaps the times would be understandable and reasonable, because 15 days can be there, but many more, for the signature of a Minister on an act that has completed its entire process, seems a lot to me. I have already said and I repeat that this question of dates is not trivial. It is not trivial because there are significant implications. In the coming weeks, after 5 years of waiting, we will finally be able to delve into the merits and details of the text; we hope not to find inconsistencies that would make it ineffective. At first reading, not everything seems so clear to us and above all it does not seem to us to be a text marked by that autonomist fierté that should characterize the implementing regulations of the Special Statute of Autonomy."

On the other two issues, in answering your question time ""where the developments relating to the Ivrea-Santhià motorway section were highlighted"", on the sidelines we can add, if we want, the informal discussions both of me and of my colleague Bertschy with both the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of the Environment, which are currently on standby, for the purpose of a verification by the Ativa company to understand if there is a path that could be positive for us, otherwise there will certainly be at least some stimuli from a political point of view to solicit a solution that can be consistent with the need to open that stretch of motorway in an appropriate time frame and in any case in parallel with the opening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, which would be the commitment that we had shared with the Ativa company at the time."

To these will be added the funds allocated with the bill of the second variation of the 2024-2026 forecast, for a total of approximately 23 million euros, which the Regional Council approved this morning, Wednesday, November 6th, which will be immediately transmitted to the presence of the Council for the start of the examination of the Commissions. I would like to remind you, for the sake of clarity and for the record, that part of the 21 million, essentially the 21 million, will be - subject to reporting by the Civil Protection system on the data provided by the Municipalities and regional structures - subject to reimbursement for 20.6 million, as decided by the National Civil Protection. The news regarding the applications submitted to obtain the redundancy fund, instead - regarding the second application - the offices of the Department of Labor and Training Policies have contacted INPS which has assured maximum attention to the applications, also reporting that many of these are incomplete and therefore it has been requested, and is necessary, to provide them with integrations."

The communication that we had asked for and urged in that resolution voted in July, which asked for a weekly commitment to reporting on this issue, has certainly been missing. With regard to the applications for redundancy payments, I note that many months have passed and in fact these are already activities that are in difficulty: not having answers yet with regard to this part is certainly burdensome for them, so I hope that with regard to the incomplete applications there will be an answer as soon as possible, because there is also a risk of closures, in some way, because - as I say - precisely those who in good faith perhaps have not fired, have nevertheless decided to keep staff, now also find themselves in this situation.

Specifically, the project is aimed at children in the fifth grade of primary school and, in 2025-2026, also at those in the first year of lower secondary school. I would like to remind you that introducing children to the mountains is important to promote a complete physical activity, accessible to everyone, aimed at improving psychological well-being. A correct approach to the mountains, starting from the preparations for the excursion, from the backpack to the clothing and equipment, up to learning how to behave correctly along the path, respecting the environment, flora and fauna, is essential for today's young people to better understand the world around them and to be able to enjoy it in a more conscious way, also with a view to orienting them in the future. Specifically, in collaboration with the Alpine guides, the following programs have been proposed: ""The mountain around us"" (focused on culture and hiking, to introduce the mountains that surround the school or the town where the children live); ""The vertical mountain"" (focused on climbing, to introduce sport climbing, highlighting how this can be fun and educational from a psychomotor point of view. Particular attention will be paid to making children, teachers and families understand that this activity does not present objective risks when practiced correctly); ""Immersion in nature"" for a lower secondary school, school year 2025-2026, focused on culture and outdoor activities over two days. I would also like to emphasize that this project has an inclusive nature as it involves all children, even those with motor disabilities, thanks to the intervention of specialized mountain guides, in addition to those already provided for in the individual programs. The first two programs include, similarly to the ""Scivolare"" project, a theoretical part in class of two modules, together with a practical part with field trips. The theoretical part, first module, consists of a standardized presentation, approximately 15-20 minutes, similar for all schools, with video-photographic support on the Aosta Valley mountains and the various activities that can be carried out there. Following this, a specific intervention is planned for each school with short videos and photos specifically referring to the reality surrounding the school and the Municipality involved. In this part of the intervention, in addition to the characteristics of the surrounding environment, the various activities that can be carried out in the territory itself will be briefly explained. Then there is a second module, which is the explanation of how to prepare a backpack and how to plan a simple trip to the mountains in front of the house: weather, maps, paths, pay attention to any bulletins, etc. The duration is 15-20 minutes. A game will then be proposed with the students divided into groups, the aim will be to prepare a backpack by choosing the right material for a specific excursion. Then there is a practical part which is the ""Mountains around us"" program. They are two trips on the territory lasting 3-4 hours each, which will consist of a winter session (January-February) of walking on an easy path/terrain possibly snow-covered, with an explanation of the characteristics of the surrounding mountains, therefore slopes, plains, sunshine, different aspects of the vegetation, therefore the adret or the envers, consideration of the glaciations that formed the valley furrow, etc. Then there is a spring session (April-May), a treasure hunt with the aim of making the kids move independently on outdoor terrain, encouraging them to work in groups. The ""Vertical Mountain"" program consists of two outings lasting 3-4 hours each, climbing on natural or artificial sites based on logistical convenience. The period is to be defined based on the location and availability of indoor facilities. The cost of the project per class group is 1650 euros plus VAT, if due, which includes the basic cost of the guide day for the theoretical and practical part; the cost includes the living expenses of the alpine guides, transportation, meals, etc. and the equipment necessary to carry out the program. The Administration has allocated 20,000 euros for 2025 for the experimentation of the project, involving three schools of the first cycle of education in the 2024-2025 school year. With what criteria and methods will the classes that will be part of this experimental project be identified? Since this is an experimental project, we will start with three schools identified according to the following criteria: territoriality (therefore middle and lower Valley, Aosta and neighboring municipalities, upper Valley); number of projects, under regional ownership. already started by the school institution according to a rotation principle, in order to guarantee the participation of the greatest number of students attending schools in the Aosta Valley."
47922,XVI,06/11/2024,"FORESTE E TERRITORI MONTANI, ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,4,3813,"I thank the Councilor for this very complete answer, which touched on several topics. Above all, for each question that was asked with the interrogation, we tried to give answers for each point in the most appropriate way. It is a topic to which, as Rassemblement Valdôtain, we have always paid a lot of attention and a lot of importance, because in any case we know that the topic of the mountain and everything that concerns it is a topic that we can try to improve and change things a little, if we start from a change starting from the young people and the kids. So it is great that we start in a better way to carry out more initiatives and increasingly in synergy with other initiatives, in an integrated way, touching on the various aspects that concern the mountain, nature, safety, the risks that can happen on that terrain every day. So it is a project that we are looking at very carefully, but at the same time we hope that, as often happens, there are projects that start at an experimental level or there are occasions where... for example here it is said that the State contributed to this project - I took the information from this article - with 67,000 euros and the Region integrated the resources to complete the project, which therefore amounted to a total amount of 115,000 euros; that they are not initiatives that, as I repeat, are very important, are carried out for a year and then maybe there is some discontinuity, but there is continuity on these issues that we consider important and strategic, especially in these periods, in which we see that in the mountains there are more and more climate changes to manage suddenly and therefore going to sensitize young people, to try to make them understand the dynamics also of how to move in the mountains, of what the mountains are like, both with regards to the sporting aspect but also linked to its morphology of the territory, is very important, especially from an educational point of view and then also of approach in the field. This is one aspect. The article talked about that up to 18 years of age in Valle d'Aosta the percentage is the highest with regards to kids who practice sports activities, but then unfortunately the people of Valle d'Aosta move away from skiing. Here it would be important to understand if the article stopped there or understand from data or statistics that you may have or that can be explored, if it concerns only skiing or a decline in other disciplines and therefore understand if it is possible to work in more sectors. Another very important aspect is that we suggest, as you rightly said, obviously starting from the end of this year and then next year we will select some schools, therefore a certain number of classes, a limited number of students to start on an experimental basis with this initiative, obviously the hope is that then over the years the resources available will be increased, the project expanded to try to allow a greater number of kids, therefore as many schools as possible, to follow this path to reach the great goals of educating all young people in the best possible way about the opportunities and risks of the mountains and therefore what, in a concrete way, the Aosta Valley is for their future. That's it. Finally, it would also be very appropriate to go and convey, in addition to all the positive aspects that you mentioned in your answer, also that concept of self-responsibility that, when we address the law for the revision of the regional legal system, we will have in an article, so also this passage, bring it into this initiative, we believe that it could be a good opportunity to go and start this path in the best possible way."
47923,XVI,06/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,5175,"The Councilor questions the Government for information regarding the members of the technical coordination table for the development of renewable energy communities. The technical table is composed of the following entities: Sustainable Energy Development Structure, Aosta Valley Chamber of Businesses and Professions, Consortium of Local Authorities of the Aosta Valley, Coa Energia Service of Finaosta, hereinafter Coa Energia. Each of these members identifies its own representative or delegate competent in the matter. The tasks of the table are identified in the 5 paragraphs provided for in the article and give the table a whole series of activities ranging from promotion to encourage the creation of self-consumption configurations in the regional territory, to analyze the monitoring data of widespread self-consumption configurations, where available, to proactively discuss the evolution of self-consumption configurations spread across the regional territory, to propose any improvement actions of direction for the implementation of this law, to prepare an annual report for the regional Councilor competent in energy matters for the purposes of subsequent illustration to the relevant Council Commission. English: For the first question (""whether the representatives of Celva and the Chambre in the technical table will be chosen as qualified experts""), as highlighted in the premises, the choice of the representatives in charge is left to the free choice of the subjects participating in the technical table. Leaving aside the definition ""perimeter of characteristics, an official or an expert must have in order to be declared qualified expert"", it is difficult, in this first phase of implementation of the legislation in the field of widespread self-consumption, to be able to identify qualified expert personnel both due to the almost complete absence of training courses in this field, and due to the short period of time that has passed since the complete definition of the regulatory framework in this matter. Therefore, as specified in the resolution establishing the table, the participating subjects identify their own representative on the issues relating to CER, which we recall are various and diversified as they imply not only energy knowledge, but also legal and social knowledge, as well as the verification of the application methods and the impact of the legislation and related implementing measures with respect to the Public Administration and businesses. It is also specified that the presence of Celva and the Chambre at the technical table is not aimed only at providing technical knowledge on the matter in question, but is above all also useful for the purposes of dialogue with the territory, as a reference stakeholder for local authorities and businesses, subjects potentially interested in the development of renewable energy communities. While waiting for the formalization of the designation of the members of the technical table, a first meeting was held last Monday 28 October; during the same it was highlighted how each subject will be able to avail themselves of specific consultancy and collaboration, which may be involved in the work of the table. In particular, as regards the Region and Coa Energia, the collaboration already in place with the GSE is highlighted, the start of contacts with RSE for the definition of a collaboration agreement, in addition to the consultancy activated with the Sani Zangrando firm for the legal-administrative aspects. It is also noted that, if the technical table highlights the need to find highly specialized professionalism on specific topics to be explored, external experts may be involved and any resulting expenses may be covered in the annual operational plans of Coa Energia. ""What are the names and qualifications of the members, the Cer technical table and with what provision were they identified?"": similarly to what has been done on other technical tables, the adoption of a specific provision for the identification of members is not foreseen, but obviously each entity appoints them with the provisions it deems appropriate. The names have been identified by the participating subjects and will be formally transmitted. As regards the Coa Energia of Finaosta for the meeting of the table on 28 October, a note was sent with the designation of Genny Brunet to replace Andrea Comé. The formal designation was made on 31 October in the Board of Directors. We are waiting for the appointment to be formalized and registered. As regards the Chambre, Federico Molino participated. Here too, the Chambre is preparing the act of appointment and as regards Celva it was represented by Mattia Calliano and Sara Pinet was appointed as substitute. Regarding sustainable energy development, Tamara Cappellari, Simone Gamba and Ingrid Bal took part in the table. ""On what date was or will the technical table insertion meeting take place?"": this first table took place on October 28th and there will soon be, once formalized by all the entities, a second meeting in the coming weeks."

We had insisted that the component subjects and the characteristics of these subjects that we believed were important, should be indicated in the law. You had preferred that they be indicated only in the report, not in the articles. In that resolution, however, the need for the representatives of the Chambre and Celva to be qualified technicians is not highlighted, as had been agreed, because we had mediated to reach the approval of that law and in the resolution that we saw we expected the names, also because two months had passed. We all expected there to be some more information, because the constitution and the operation of the table is an absolutely urgent thing. Now you tell us that there was a first meeting which, if I understood correctly, is not the one that has already formalized the complete composition of the table, but is preparatory to it. You told us that Dr. Molino participated for the Chambre, Calliano for Celva, but this classification, let's say, this characteristic of experience is not there. You tell me ""they must not only be technicians with knowledge in the energy field, but there must also be someone who knows the economic reality and that of the Municipalities well""; no one says no, but what had been agreed was something absolutely different. This answer does not satisfy me because the compromise that had been reached was not respected. The other issue is that we approved a law, if I remember correctly, on July 27-28; on October 28 (so three months have passed), this table still does not formally exist, because someone has appointed, someone must appoint, the formal designation of the Coa has arrived, but the others are being awaited. I believe that we need to shift into a different gear because there is an urgency that we have reported over and over again and that concerns the process that underlies the creation, constitution and diffusion of the CERs, because as far as the public CERs are concerned we are absolutely at sea and - as I have already said more than once - we are worried because the impression is that there is no concrete and effective will to operate. Not only that. The CER movement in Valle d'Aosta could be robust and should be widespread; we have seen the announcement that was issued, but it seems to us, because we also spoke with someone, that Mayors and Administrators are in difficulty and we are increasingly convinced, even compared to before, that without a regional direction the risk is that in the end something extremely minimal, limited and not very incisive will be realized. In our opinion, it is a shame, because there is a risk of not fully grasping an opportunity that is important and that in our region could have a notable development."
47924,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,5059,"Colleague Manfrin, I had a bit of a hard time organizing the answer. I say this sincerely, but in the sense that, if it is possible to have some more information, I will undertake to complete it, because from some premises it was difficult to try to organize an answer. In any case, to come to the first question (""if you are aware of what was reported""), there is more than one report here, but precise references are missing. I repeat, I will try to give you some answers, but let's consider the initiative open to subsequent information. As for the first premise (a letter was sent to the media saying that the bus takes an hour and a half), there are different travel times: there are, for example, direct buses Aosta-Ivrea, which take less than an hour. The replacement service must, by its nature, try to give an answer to all users in the area, so there are buses that stop at all the stops, there are direct buses, there are semi-direct buses, those that take people to the lower Valley, and we are increasingly using motorway routes and therefore the travel times are not an hour and a half, but can also be an hour and a half when we have to give continuity to people's journeys. ""I learned from reports received - I'm going to the premises because I believe the question is articulated on the various premises - that sometimes the replacement buses planned do not actually perform the service"": we are not aware of this, there is also a whole check that is done, obviously, and when this happens it is reported. The reserve is started in the case that it needs to be replaced, but a service must be done; when it is not carried out in some way it must - unless something particular has happened - be integrated with the organization that they have given us. We have extended the reserve precisely to give continuity to all seasons and to understand well what the effects of the service are. Then there is another consideration: ""I learned specifically that on September 16th of the three scheduled trips departing from Ivrea, with two that had... the ""semi"" direct trip scheduled was cancelled..."" There is a long premise, here we were unable to understand what it was about and so maybe if you have more information I will collect it again. On September 16th there was a change in timetable, so I don't know if this refers to that moment of timetable change, if there is more information, but, I repeat, with respect to this we undertake to do a further check. The episode of the transfer seems very strange to us, we have not had any news and, I repeat, there is a check both by Trenitalia and by us with an adequate service. If there is something that has escaped we will gladly look into it further. It then says ""finally learned of cases of cancellation of scheduled trips that have occurred several times"": the cancellation of trips certainly does not occur to this extent, it can happen; in this specific case it can happen in some situations. It happens almost more on the railway section because there are interruptions that are due to infrastructure problems and it can happen in this sense. Those are then re-protected with the motorway trips. However, I repeat, all this is the objective of further investigation and we will gladly, if there are reports, complete our analysis. To come to the second question (""if the managers of the replacement trips have informed the Department about the cancelled trips""): with respect to the information, we are the ones who intervene directly through Trenitalia, there is an operations room that works daily with respect to the organization of the services. If there are cancellations, there is a whole procedure that is activated and we verify on a sample basis - a very important sample with our services - the quality of the service provided by traveling directly with the personnel who deal with these checks on the replacement buses. As for ""whether replacement trips were paid to the route managers without the service being performed"", this must not happen, there is a contract that regulates the relationships. We work on a quarterly basis. All trips are subject to inspection. For each trip there is a registration of the departure and arrival points, so if this were to happen it must be included in this quarterly report, where the checks and payments are then made. So, I repeat, it is an answer, mine, perhaps not so detailed. If there is more specific information or more specific requests from you we will continue to investigate, and, I repeat, precisely because all this is regulated, the Region... the contract is managed by Trenitalia, which has entrusted this service to Busitalia through a manager. We are not the ones who manage the contract, but obviously we bear the costs, as we did for rail transport, so we are available to continue to control the services."

The problem is that - I will summarise it briefly, then at this point I will send you the precise reports - I think it is a bit difficult to reconstruct ex post what happened, but I think that the clearest and most effective part of your response is the one where you say that you are not aware of any cancellations of journeys. In reality what has been reported is that these cancellations have occurred and have been made on several occasions and trivially again on Sunday there was a real struggle to manage to get off in Turin. Four hours of travel between cancellations, missed connections with trains, drivers who announced that the train would wait because there was the famous delay, the one that was also talked about today with the Santhià link road, and then afterwards in reality no train waited and therefore there was then an extension of the times. There are some critical issues that, however, evidently, from your response it is clear that they are not communicated; at this point we will detail them with the times and schedules. I do not know if then with the detail of the times of the schedules you will be able to go to the company to ask for an account of these cancellations because, at this point, if they have not been communicated, the answer will be ""we are not aware of it""; however, clearly the indications are there. Trivially, I believe that however, by reporting at least this, that is, the letter that was transmitted and published by some media outlets regarding the issue of travel times, you were able to take note - I imagine - at least of this. I imagine so. At least you were able to reconstruct this and I think it is the part you mentioned, that is, the issue of the routes that take longer or shorter. What I am pointing out to you is that perhaps there are some inconsistencies that need to be looked into, especially when it is said that there are a number of replacement buses that provide a service and then in reality they are a smaller number, so probably some further investigation in this sense will need to be done and we will provide you with all the documentation. For the moment, we thank you and we are certain that at least this report - although not so precise and exhaustive, but we were convinced that you were aware of everything - will stimulate greater attention from now on."

The question is ""whether all the preparatory activities planned for the period January-May 2024 are concluded"": the preparatory activities for the works in progress are concluded, some preparatory activities still need to be carried out as they are functional to the works that will be carried out later. Point two (""whether all the works whose programme envisaged the start of the works in the months of June, July, September, October 2024 have actually started""), having heard RFI, which confirms that the works in progress are aligned with the programme. ""With what system and methods does the Region provide for the permanent monitoring of the construction of the works?"": obviously, the monitoring takes place through the continuous discussions of the technical structures with the technical structures of RFI, through a punctual control also by the structures with respect to the progress of the design. Obviously, it is not the Region that manages the contract with the company that carries out the work and therefore the dialogue is an ongoing dialogue with RFI. At this time there are daily contacts with the other actors that must be involved in the construction site works, in particular the local authorities, because there is a schedule both with respect to the works of the electrification of the railway and with respect to what must then be budgeted in terms of road and travel and construction sites, also on the investments that are made, affecting regional roads or municipal roads. The work is a work that takes into account the many aspects and the many complexities on which we must try to work together, moving forward quickly, also given the execution times of these works which, we remember, must be completed by June 2026."
47925,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,2755,"One of the answers regarding the timetable had been somewhat anticipated in that meeting on October 8th, namely that, according to the CEO, there is confirmation that the works will be completed as planned by 2026 and in reality by the first part of the year, the first six months of 2026, because then we know that the following six months will be those necessary for testing and all that is the most bureaucratic part, to get to the reopening of the line in December 2026. On that occasion, which was the one in which the protocol was also signed, some details, in the first part, had come; then, as we were saying this morning, little had been said about the issue of the memorandum of understanding and, in my opinion, there is little in what I received, because I expected different things. But, beyond this, the timetable, which I had received with access to the documents in May 2024, envisaged a whole series of works, detailed interventions, very detailed, with starting dates and that was what I wanted to have confirmations on. You told me that we are aligned with what the timetable was. I would have been happier if you had given a detail, also because for what concerns, for example, the electrical substations: for Aosta there was talk of starting work in October 2024, as well as for what concerns the interventions and the passenger buildings, in July 2024. On the Aosta issue I am not so sure that everything is like this - also because October ended a few days ago, this must also be said -, but we hope that this timetable is followed word for word as it was sent. We were also told that there could be variations, because during the work it is possible that this is the case, but at the moment you tell us that everything is confirmed, so we will check. On the issue of the methods with which the Region provides monitoring, you say ""we are not the ones in charge of the works, it is RFI, so there is a dialogue, but they are the ones who must follow the works more specifically"". Well, what we certainly recommend is that there be a control, as I am sure has been done and I hope will continue to be, punctual and continuous. I also say this because I know that there are difficulties with regard to the personnel who must be in charge of this, given that unfortunately there are shortages at the level of staff and it is not a fault, but it is a fact. On the issue of the timetable, you told me ""we are aligned"" and did not tell me about variations, so I take what was delivered in May as valid and we will see to verify these works punctually, as they were done."

The first question asks about the status of the design of the works relating to the hypothesized Stella del Couis: the executive design of the new Pila-Couis cableway and the annexed panoramic bar-restaurant was approved by the Board of Directors of the Pila company on 10/06/2024, following the successful conclusion of the preventive verification activity provided for by Article 26 of Legislative Decree 50/2016. Consequently, during the summer of 2024, it was possible to proceed with the construction of the panoramic bar-restaurant at the same time as the construction of the second section of the cableway system. With reference to the panoramic bar-restaurant, all the reinforced concrete structures, the metal carpentry structures and a part of the civil systems have been completed at present. The completion of the roofing and the installation of the external infill windows are currently underway, while the completion of the works with the completion of the civil systems and the finishing touches is expected during the next summer. ""Whether a study has been planned to identify the best management configuration of the refuge"": yes, a study is planned. The company has appointed a professional expert in the field, with an economic-financial plan relating to the refreshment point, which summarises the patrimonial, financial and economic implications deriving from the implementation of the investment in the relative management. Regarding question three (""timing and costs of the entire Pila-Couis cableway operation, including snowmaking systems, adoption of water and fuel, renewable energy systems, construction of the refuge""), the work schedule foresees the completion of the works during the next summer, with the construction of the first section of the service centre system planned at the departure station and the completion of the panoramic bar-restaurant in time for the start of the 2025-2026 winter season. With regard to the ancillary works, in particular the slope adaptation works, including the creation of avalanche and fall protection systems and the programmed snowmaking system, almost all the planned works have been completed, with the exception of some interfering sections of the snowmaking system line, which will consequently be built during the next summer. The overall cost of the work, including the bar-restaurant, ancillary works, slope adaptation, snowmaking system, protection systems and everything else needed, is more than 60 million euros and is distributed through direct financing from Pila, self-financing financing and the use of financing provided for by law 8. Surely, before the start of the Christmas holidays the second section of the system will be activated, the one that connects Couis 1, so there will already be the possibility of using a part of the system starting this year. The company's goal is to speed up the final and investment operations, to be able to complete the tests even before the holidays, however, at the moment, we are not able to give a definitive and certain date for the start of the use of this second section."

I must correct the criticism I made of you in the last Council when - I already had the opportunity to say it on the street - I gave you a seriously insufficient rating. I saw that the freight elevator was then fixed here at the station and so well done for the prompt intervention. It is also true that a bike could fit in that freight elevator and I didn't think it could fit, so I change that response from ""seriously"" to ""just insufficient"". Anyway, thank you. Instead, let's talk about Pila. The Couis Star... On February 8, I asked you these questions and you rightly, answering about the work that was in progress, the work to build the upstream section, had the opportunity to say that the work relating to the panoramic refreshment point will start during the next summer - as you have actually confirmed to me now -, carried out at the same time as the construction of the second section of the cableway system. At the same time, however, he said, ""the executive project relating to the non-cableway works is being perfected, it will be submitted as soon as possible to the verification provided for in article 26, etc."", that's what he still said. And I'm stuck there; I probably missed some passages, but you remember well and I understand that you have a lot of commitments, but you had promised to provide us with a more complete detail of the study, we had asked for some planning, some graphic reporting of this work, we didn't get anything and now we find ourselves with this work already completed. The second question concerned the study carried out, whether it was possible to have a report or a mention in the Commission. He had also promised us that he would come to the Commission to report. I haven't heard anything about the Pila station, but this study on the management of the Couis 1 refuge, if there was a way to have some more information, I think it would be useful for the entire population. We learned that before the holidays, section II will probably already be in operation, so it's certainly good news that everyone is eagerly awaiting; but I continue to have many doubts about the Stella del Couis structure - and I wrote it down in the introduction - because we have Councilor Sapinet, President Testolin who continue to remind us that there is a dramatic climate change, extreme weather conditions that require a different way of managing the mountain or the territory and then we build a structure that I will be curious to see how long it will be able to resist the meteorological impact on the Platta di Grevon, an area truly battered by bad weather; but we hope for the sun, that there will always be beautiful days. I continue to have doubts, I am curious to see what will be achieved. I reiterate the fact that we have not seen a single document, a single project. We must trust his words.

47927,XVI,06/11/2024,"INDUSTRIA, LAVORO",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,4188,"Councilor Guichardaz questions the Government for news on the prospects for ensuring job retention at the Eltek and Itw Fusion plants in Hône. Obviously, the Government on these two plants, but as on the general situation regarding the automotive sector, has continuous contact with the activity of companies having tasks that obviously cannot be management or direct intervention, but relationships with respect to the activity and the fallout of a situation that at a European level in particular is causing major problems for the entire automotive supply chain, even in important countries such as Germany. We have all read about the negotiations that are underway with respect to some large manufacturing companies, so all of this in some way at this moment creates problems for the entire supply chain. From what we have learned, but also from what we have said to each other at this moment, it is still a moment of management of the situation. They are two slightly different situations, those of the two plants: Itw is completely tied to the automotive sector, while Eltek for part of its production is also starting to work in the biomedical sector. This is a bit of the fruit of the research activity of the past years, we hope that in this perspective a supply chain within the company production that goes in this direction can continue to grow, because this diversification of production, as always, can also be useful with respect to the general market situation. For the rest of the production, Eltek also deals with the household appliances and automotive sector, so with respect to this, at this moment, there are some attentions. What I have been able to ascertain in the relationships with the two companies is that however it is a limited period, requested in a greater way than what is the real use, in particular for now we are dealing with... The redundancy fund on Eltek concerns a complete shift of work for a department. The hope is that there will be a recovery starting from the next semester, but at this moment it does not depend directly on the company. The same goes for Itw, which above all has also tried to regulate the warehouse management activity precisely because there is a decline at the moment and the request for redundancy payments is needed to try to organize the work stoppage phase as best as possible, trying to distribute it equally among all workers, trying to be as careful as possible not to burden one department rather than another. The commitment I have at the moment is to maintain contact with these two companies and to continue investing in the research sectors trying to create conditions so that all companies in general, not just these, can continue to try to build development projects, even in different directions, and what we have made a commitment to do is to hear from each other in the first few days of December to understand if the situation will persist or if in the next semester, first semester 2025, there could be any new evaluations by the two plants. The automotive sector does not only concern these two companies. As I was saying, we are also in contact with other companies that are trying to best manage this phase, which is a phase of market slowdown and we reiterate what we say here from time to time - in particular, colleague Perron supports it very determinedly - there is a need for the European Government and the Italian Government to be very clear on the automotive development projects, on the investments to be dedicated to companies. There is a huge discussion in Italy linked to Stellantis because, as we all know, the growth projects, especially for electric cars, have not been respected. There are production contractions that need to see development programs financed at a European level, at an Italian level, so that industries can return to supporting a production cycle that gives the best possible response to workers and also to the development of our territories."

In recent weeks, however, the unions have placed strong attention on these two plants precisely because of the issue of redundancy payments that you were talking about and above all because from this point of view there are no signs - or at least that's what we learned by reading the press releases - of any great glimmers of hope in this direction. There is great concern, so it would certainly be important to be able to address the issue of industry in the Aosta Valley sometime, which is not just CAS, but above all in the lower Valley, it is certainly an important reality and you perhaps know it better than others, so certainly from this point of view also the fact of being extremely linked to the automotive industry and above all to Stellantis is leading these companies to be in difficulty. We will certainly focus attention on these plants again later to understand if in some way the companies have found a way to recover, well aware of what you were saying about the general crisis in the automotive industry at this time."
47928,XVI,06/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,2,3861,"The colleague brings the discussion back to the Palaindoor. As he recalls in the question, the Palaindoor is included among those works defined as being of regional interest, as this regional administration intended to contribute to the costs borne by the Municipality of Aosta for the works to bring the facility up to standard in order to obtain fire prevention certification. In particular, two different resolutions have been adopted for this purpose in the last two years. Let's retrace the path: with the first, 1438 of November 2021, the Region has provided for a total financing of 470,000 euros in favor of the Municipality of Aosta as a contribution to cover 50% of the estimated costs for the fire safety adaptation of the Palaindoor. Of these, 150,000 euros are related to the works of the first lot that were concluded at the end of 2022 and allowed, as the proponent also recalls, the reactivation, starting from February 2023, of some sports activities in the structure: tennis, athletics and sport climbing. The additional 320,000 euros allocated by the Region instead concern the works of the second lot currently being completed. With the second resolution, number 1471 of December 2022, the Region granted an update of the financing, mentioned above, to partially cover the increases in costs due to the adjustment of prices for supplies and works, for a total amount of 84,000 euros, of which 20,000 on the first lot and 64,000 on the second lot. Having made these premises, which demonstrate the concrete commitment of the Regional Administration so that the Palaindoor structure can be returned in its entirety to sports groups, associations and individual citizens as soon as possible, I move on to the two questions, answering with what was received from the Municipality of Aosta. The first question that the colleague asks us is ""on what date is it planned to use all the structures that make up the sports facility""? We have received the response from the Municipality of Aosta which informs us that, barring unforeseen events, the works relating to the second lot, indicated as phase one interventions, will end in December. The administrative procedures relating to obtaining the fire prevention certificate are expected to be concluded by the end of March 2025 and subsequently the Municipality plans to deliver the building to the sports office and the concessionaire. As regards the second question, ""which organization will be able to take over the complete management of the sports facility, which many Regions envy us?"", in relation to this point, the Municipality of Aosta recalls that with resolution of the Municipal Council, the 148 of 5 August 2024, it was decided to start the procedure for the temporary assignment of the management of the Palaindoor starting from 1 July 2024 until 31/12/2024, proceeding with the formal request to the old manager. Furthermore, it has established that the Municipal Administration will proceed with the identification, through a possible collaboration with the Regional Committee of the Coni of the Aosta Valley, of a new manager and the verification of the seriousness of the management, as well as the exact fulfillment of the conditions for the assignment of the facility itself, in the identification of the most suitable forms of management of the facility. The Municipality of Aosta also reported that in the months of August and September it held several meetings with the regional Coni representative to define in detail what is the collaboration agreement between the two entities. To date, therefore, the procedure is in the final phase and, barring any unforeseen events, the agreement can be approved and signed between the parties by the end of October 2024. It is noted that from 19:04 President Bertin resumes the presidency."

Alas, Aosta, European City of Sport, in 2023 the Aosta Valley European Region of Sport. For a good four years - almost five - the Palaindoor has been removed from sporting activities and the world of sport. First used as a vaccination hub, then used for the issue of planning and to carry out the work to obtain the CPI. Three phases there too, an unprecedented bizarreness. Now two lots of work that have gone very slowly. Then the opening in fits and starts, rightly so, but there we spent quite a bit; we on this side, you urged on the other, in the end all outdoor sports managed to open (the tennis that is outside, the sport climbing and subsequently also the athletics structure). But at the moment it is still closed. Closed spaces, walls still not plastered, the closed refreshment bar, which is a fundamental element. There will probably be a delay there too because the refrigerated counters, which have been out of order for four years, will need to be changed. The fact that there is still no manager, despite the fact that the municipal administration has asked all the third sector structures to take care of this matter, is truly a great failure of this troubled legislature. We truly hope that Coni can take charge... At the moment ASVA has it. ASVA manages what it can manage because it has obviously entrusted it to the companies that can somehow carry out the activity. The truth is that that structure needs a manager. A capable and competent manager who must be financed because he cannot just stand there and collect the fees from sports clubs, federations, because we know that there is no money. It is still - we underline - a humiliation, for the entire world of sports, to have a structure that had been looked at carefully by all the Regions. ""But how, in Valle d'Aosta did you do that thing there?"". Yes, we have built a sports hall of that type, which is multipurpose, which is used for many sports activities. Unfortunately it has been closed for four and a half years and more. However, I thank you for your answers which were certainly exhaustive and gave us information, the ones we asked for. The hope is that we really move forward and I also look at the Sports Councilor, who I am sure will be careful to ensure that this thing is concluded as soon as possible. We know that Coni could be the one to manage it. There is nothing better than Coni to manage that thing, but it needs to be funded, because the money is not coming from Rome.

We had obviously asked the Municipality of Aosta for an answer, given that the question is related to an activity of the Municipality of Aosta and, among other things, was also the subject of a specific Commission meeting. Let's read it, returning to deal with that process of alienation of the 15 villas in the Cogne district for which the Municipality of Aosta announced a public auction notice in the spring. As we have repeatedly pointed out in this Chamber, the objective that the owner tells us remains that of identifying one or more buyers for those currently vacant homes and thus ensuring the start of the complex renovations that they require. As the proponent points out, the first deadline for submitting purchase offers was set for 28 June last and it was unsuccessful. In the following days, the competent municipal bodies had communicated, despite the absence of offers, that they had received positive feedback in terms of interest; for this reason, the Municipality of Aosta had decided to extend the effectiveness of the public notice of sale by a few months, a notice that was published under the same conditions and setting last September 30 as the new deadline for the submission of purchase offers. As I said and as agreed in a specific motion, in the meantime the Municipality of Aosta was heard by the competent council commissions, the third and fifth in joint session, to provide information and clarifications on the alienation project. With regard to the tender expiring on September 30, the competent offices of the Municipality confirmed to us that no offers were received with the new deadline. At this point, further evaluations and in-depth analyses are underway to help plan the continuation of the alienation operation."
47929,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,4,539,"First of all, thanks for the answers that are certainly exhaustive and I didn't think it fell into that logic, but no controversy obviously. The Municipality told you ""one or more buyers"", the tender was made only for one buyer, a single subject who could purchase the 15 villas, so it can't be like that. The extension that then went deserted confirms what we had said: that it is not possible to continue in that direction. I don't know what the Municipality of Aosta will invent, but our managers at the Municipality will take care of it."

Regarding the first two questions (whether reports have been received with respect to what is reported to us in the initiative and whether, if so, due investigations have been carried out to understand the reasons for the criticality), the attention on that stretch of road is high, as on the remaining regional road network, but on that one in particular. Also with colleague Lucianaz we have often discussed the regional topic of Gressan, Pont-Suaz, and this response is shared and the subject of...

In relation to the recent event that occurred on a stretch of regional road number 20 located in the town center of the Municipality of Gressan, in the Chevrot hamlet, the competent regional structures have been informed of the incident and assessments are underway by the Regional Administration - as I said - in coordination with the Municipal Administration to identify possible actions to be taken in order to further improve road safety. Actions that follow those already undertaken, which we will answer in the third question. It should be noted, however, that along the regional road, which falls mainly within a town center with a speed limit of 50 km/h, electronic speed control had been activated, among other things, by the Municipality of Gressan in order to induce road users to respect the speed limit. The regularly tested equipment had been rented from an external company to which the Municipality had also entrusted the service of managing penalties under the Highway Code relating to speed detection. The automatic speed detection, which began in October 2023, continued until June. The service then, according to what the Municipality of Gressan tells us, involved the installation of a device that detected in both directions, in four fixed points of the territory, three of which along the regional road number 20 and along the regional road number 40. To detect the speed, the presence on site of a local police officer equipped with a tablet was necessary, therefore, in total autonomy from the company supplying the system. On the indication of the Council and after sharing with the Mayor, the services were carried out at least biweekly, sometimes triweekly, for a period of one hour, alternating the time slots with the result of a significant drop/reduction in the speed of vehicles along this stretch of regional road. This is what the Municipality of Gressan tells us. Starting from the month of June, the Municipality had to interrupt the detections in relation to the entry into force of the interministerial decree of 11 April 2024 which made changes to the rules for the use of speed detectors. English: Currently, therefore, despite the good results in terms of compliance with speed limits and therefore safety recorded in recent months, the service is temporarily suspended, pending the regulatory clarifications that have been announced. With regard to the third question (what further actions have been implemented in synergy with the local Administration to make this stretch of road safe), road safety, included in the 2020-2025 Legislature program, is one of the issues of attention by our Government. It should be noted that several maintenance and safety interventions on the road network, which we know has a length of approximately 500 km, are planned in the regional public works program 2024-2026 and are currently being implemented. Following the competition, even from Capo Cantoniere, it was possible to restore the six circles - once there were 8 and, due to staff shortages and retirements, it has dropped to 5 -; also the restoration of the sixth circle allows the Capo Cantonieri to have a better monitoring of what is the regional road network by dividing a smaller number of kilometers each. The regional road number 20 of Gressan, also taking into account the important vehicular traffic, has been affected in recent years by the implementation of several important interventions aimed at improving road safety. I will briefly list the main ones: construction of the roundabout, which we have already spoken about, at the intersection between regional road 40 and 20, then the construction of sidewalks alongside the regional road in the municipalities of Gressan and Jovençan, for a total of 3.5 km, construction of the roundabout between Gressan and Jovençan, construction of the roundabout between regional road 20 and regional road 47, as well as pedestrian paths in the municipality of Aymavilles. Also following these interventions that we have mentioned, it should be noted, on the safety front, that along the entire stretch of regional road 20, for the section of travel along the territory of the municipality of Gressan, the continuity of the sidewalk is guaranteed starting from the border with Charvensod up to the entrance to the Jovençan roundabout. The sidewalks continue, moreover - and we know this - on the territory of the municipality of Jovençan up to the edge of the town in the locality of La Fournaise. It should also be noted that important discussions are underway with the Municipality and other stakeholders to regulate access to some commercial areas with the possibility of inserting an additional roundabout in the La Borettaz hamlet, which will also allow the speed of vehicular traffic to be limited. Finally, it should be noted that, in the current year, maintenance work has been carried out on the road surface of numerous sections of the regional road 20 of Gressan, also in order to improve road safety, as well as - that was another of the objectives - to reduce the noise emissions with the laying of low-emission sound-absorbing bituminous conglomerate, in implementation of the action plan for the management of environmental noise on the regional road, which is the subject of the initiative."
47930,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,3920,"Thank you Councilor for your response and for the wealth of details with which you obviously reported the actual state of the area. However, I believe that a reflection should be made on everything, that is, a series of things that you rightly mentioned, net of the maintenance that is there, and is right, and therefore falls within what can be considered the safety of a stretch of road, let's say that the criticality is above all the accident that occurred, as well as others that occurred some time ago; they are unfortunately due to the speed with which that stretch of road is tackled. That stretch of road is clearly a stretch that runs right through the middle of a residential area and that evidently draws its danger from here. What we were saying is this: if it is true that all these actions have been implemented, it is quite evident that they are not decisive and therefore it is clear that there is a need to take further steps. Coming, for example, to the issue of the detectors that were then temporarily put out of use, as we know, it was a regulatory intervention wanted with the new highway code, to prevent those devices - in our Region fortunately they are limited, but in other areas they proliferate and become ATMs for the Administrations, rather than a traffic control system - from undergoing hyper-fetations, let's call them that. What we were told, however - I think you will have been told too - with respect to the collection of signatures from residents in the area, is that traffic lights were in operation that were then deactivated and probably the traffic lights - but this is a municipal competence, that's why we then wanted to include the passage of synergy with the Municipal Administration within the initiative - if they were in operation, probably an additional deterrent would have been obtained. What unfortunately has resulted today is that we find ourselves having to deal again with accidents in the upper part of this stretch. What was then discussed with other colleagues is the problem of filling that stretch of road which, in my opinion, concerns another issue and that is how to unload, how to avoid overloading that stretch of road which is different. The problem is revealed more than anything at night, in the evening-night hours when visibility is lower, when traffic is certainly lower if not scarce, but the conditions of curves and poor visibility of the road sections clearly make crossing dangerous. It is clear that, if we find ourselves having to deal with a problem during the day where traffic needs to be speeded up and unloaded, and on this several proposals have been made to allow a direct connection to the state road; from the night front, early morning the time of the accident, which by pure chance did not turn out to be fatal, instead there must be guaranteed a presence that allows to avoid the repetition of these accidents, that this can be achieved either by restoring the traffic light or with an action of greater visibility and therefore the possibility of being able to have better visibility, also because it seems that the car that hit the pedestrian was going about 80 km/h, so certainly in that stretch of road with the houses in the area it certainly cannot be simple. Having said that there are different interventions that vary depending on the time and therefore how to clear that road during the day, in the morning or in the afternoon, and how instead to try to reduce the dangers instead in the evening hours and with conditions of less visibility, so I thank you for the insights that you wanted to provide us. Obviously we will now also do a check with respect to what you told us, also with the inhabitants of the area, to understand if these could be solutions that will be able to intervene on the problem."
47931,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,2,6459,"We return with colleague Baccega to talk about state roads, 26 and 27. Four questions. With the first question he asks us about the results of the discussion with ANAS, if it occurred: I confirm that last October 18th a meeting was held with the ANAS managers, in which the various topics were discussed again, including the topic relating to the safety of the stretch of state road 26 of the Municipalities of Quart and Saint-Christophe. The meeting had been scheduled for a few weeks previously and, given the importance of the topic, we confirmed it despite the fact that the Council was also working on it and was extended for an additional day on Friday. However, by postponing it, we would have lost precious weeks and so we managed to organize ourselves for this meeting. It was an opportunity to share some design solutions - and the meeting focused particularly on the issue of Quart and Saint-Christophe - that the ANAS technicians proposed to us. These solutions obviously require further study and discussion between all the parties involved in the implementation of the interventions, first and foremost the municipal administrations involved, the stakeholders present in the areas bordering the state road. An intervention that you, having held this role previously, know well and know the problems, know the urgency, but also the impact that this intervention will have on the territory. New meetings will be scheduled shortly, for which I have also asked for the availability of some colleagues in the Government, because it is an intervention that does have a public works management, but we know well that it involves trade, it involves transport, tourism, civil protection and many other actors. New meetings, therefore, are necessary to find a synthesis between the parties and identify as soon as possible the best design and implementation solutions to guarantee the safety of vehicle flows, without forgetting the need to ensure the passability and crossing of the affected road section also by pedestrians and cyclists. As I have already said on other previous occasions, the intervention is as urgent as it is delicate, so it is important to proceed with caution, but above all by opening the discussion, in particular I think of all the commercial activities that gravitate in that territory. It is a meeting, the one on the 18th, that had a specific focus on this dossier. Already next week we will meet again to also broaden the discussion on other issues. With regard to the second question (when will the ANAS Valle d'Aosta Focus be forwarded to the Regional Councilors, with the relative tables of the interventions that summarize the works planned in Valle d'Aosta, the works to be financed and the works already financed?), we are working with ANAS in order to be able to have the document prepared. ANAS is carrying out an important maintenance work on the state roads present in the Aosta Valley territory, with a view to ensuring easier and safer travel on them. These maintenance interventions can certainly generate, especially in the summer period, with the presence of tourists, some critical situations that we are trying to address and resolve. In order to increasingly limit these situations of discomfort, ANAS and the Region are actively collaborating with specific analyses of the interventions, their timing and possible solutions aimed at reducing the problems as much as possible. In this perspective, it is believed that, taking into account the imminent winter suspension of construction sites, ANAS can transmit a plan in the first months of next year that details the interventions to be concluded and the new interventions to be activated, also indicating a timetable for the works and any restrictions on circulation. This plan can be shared in this Council and in the Commission. Tomorrow with a further initiative on a roundabout we will return to the subject. On the third question (whether you have planned to involve the competent Commission for an in-depth examination of the interventions), I will certainly take care to involve the competent Council Commission, which I also thank for the continuous and fruitful collaboration, on the complex of interventions as well as on the new project for the safety of the stretch of state road 26. On that we had made a commitment that we have not forgotten and that obviously we intend to keep as soon as we have the documents that the ANAS technicians will provide us, obviously after that great important work of sharing. Fourth and final question: whether ANAS has been given an indication of the level of urgency of the intervention on state road 26 of the stretch between Quart and the entrance to Aosta. English: I confirm, also here, the evidence that the safety of that section in question is a priority for this Administration. This priority has been shared and reiterated to ANAS in the meetings held in recent months, last week, and in those to come, also in the presence of the two Administrations involved, who participated in the meeting which was also partly dedicated to the municipal Administrations. ANAS has also recently confirmed that the intervention requires a total investment of 35.65 million euros and is currently included in the ANAS Mit 2021-2025 program contract, which was approved with prescription and with resolution number 6 of 2024 at Cipess in the session of 21 March 2024, subsequently published in the Official Journal, general series number 160, on 10 July 2024. Available funding that today amounts to 24 million euros, of which 20 million from funds for new works and four million from the Convention funds. I therefore reiterate that I anticipated to ANAS the opportunity that, after sharing and approving the general design of the intervention, priority can be given - as we have already discussed here - to some functional sections of greater urgency; among these, in particular, the two roundabouts located at the traffic lights of the airport and the motorway junction. Therefore a design that will continue for the entire intervention, but then the will, which I believe was also shared, to give a certain priority, a certain urgency, to the two roundabouts."
47931,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,4,967,"This time we have clearer ideas, in the sense that, as we had already stated, the money made available at the time was not sufficient, we have arrived at a figure of 35 million and some in resolution 6 of 21 March 2024, right? If I understood correctly on the fly. The issue is this: that stretch of road is really very dangerous. Just last week there were two accidents, fortunately not serious, in the sense that there were no injuries or worse, however, two accidents that somehow slow down traffic, block the routes, some go to work late, others go to school with difficulty. Then there are the new pedestrians, who cross the road indiscriminately and it is very dangerous. The two roundabouts are fine, but a minimum of traffic island needs to be included, in this first intervention considered a priority. We are waiting for this project, we are waiting to see it in the Commission, as you said, but urgently request this route."
47932,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5171,"We answer the three questions in the interrogation, which are: whether it is possible that the Italian Ministry of Health has not received monthly data on the reorganizations of regional hospital beds referred to in the aforementioned decree, and above all whether the data has been correctly transmitted. Question no. 2: whether the ten hospital beds available in the triangle could be included in that table and whether they are currently used. Question no. 3: whether there is a way to streamline communication with the Ministry of Health and in general with the entire population, in order to avoid further unpleasant representations on the Health Plan in our Region, using the large PNRR funds made available by numerous programs for the digitalization of Aosta Valley healthcare. We confirm that the data published in the aforementioned press article do not correspond to the real situation of the provision of intensive and sub-intensive care hospital beds that, overall, are present in our health service. We confirm that the periodic monitoring feedback required by Legislative Decree 34/2020 has always been provided to the Ministry. English: We inform you that discussions are underway with the technicians of the Ministry of Health to update the Hospital Network Organization Plan approved with resolution 584/2020, including within it the beds that we have actually increased, as requested. In fact, the Region had been asked to achieve an increase of 10 additional intensive care beds and 9 additional beds for sub-intensive care. Regarding intensive care, 12 beds are currently available at the Parini Hospital in the resuscitation department; these 12 beds can reach up to 22 considering the 10 beds created by the commissioner structure for the health emergency (the so-called triangle) and then transferred to the USL Company by the commissioner structure itself. Therefore, with respect to the request for an additional 10 intensive care beds, our Region has, to date, achieved an increase of 12 beds, of which 2 in the resuscitation department and 10 in the triangle. , additional sub-intensive care beds have been created in the facility adjacent to the infectious disease pulmonology department. Therefore, in fact, our increase was equal to over 105% of what was requested by the Ministry. The published data therefore refer to the Hospital Network Reorganization Plan planned to deal with the pandemic and included the construction of a prefabricated building, C1, which was to be placed between the blood collection center and block C, i.e. the current location of the resuscitation department, and connected to the latter. It is precisely in this sense, as mentioned, that discussions are underway to update the aforementioned plan, for which we have requested and obtained a meeting with the Ministry, convened for November 12. The press reports do not take into account, therefore, the fact that in our Region the increase in intensive and sub-intensive care beds occurred using the beds created by the extraordinary commissioner structure for the health emergency. Although this situation has been communicated to the Ministry of Health several times, it has not been correctly represented in the press reports referred to. In this regard, we inform you that we have further represented to the Minister of Health the particular situation that characterizes our Region, requesting an integration of the data disclosed, so that correct and exhaustive information is guaranteed. On the other hand, it would seem simplistic to think that communications given to the Ministry can guide what the media freely publish. In any case, we agree that we have once again represented to the Minister - in a more timely manner than we had already had the opportunity to share in the meeting of November 17, 2023 - the fact that it is possible that the data that in general may emerge with respect to the health service of the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta do not always truthfully represent its reality. In this sense, in the meeting of the 12th, we will try to represent the above again and naturally the undersigned has rewritten to the Minister of Health. The only positive data, colleague Lucianaz, regardless of the fact that you and I enjoy telling each other what we think, is that, in fact, as far as intensive and sub-intensive care beds are concerned, regardless of the press reports that we tried to make sure were correct, we still obtained a 105% increase, so we went well beyond what we theoretically had to do, and this is a positive data for the community. Unfortunately, public opinion, the press and who decides to give the data and to whom, does not depend on us, even if we try to improve in this sense."
47932,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,1971,"English: Well, Councilor, you have given us a more than convincing answer. If I may, you slipped a bit on the last sentence because ""They do not depend on us"", I would like to see who it depends on if the Ministry must receive monthly... I repeat the sentence in the introduction to the initiative: ""Every month the regional administrations are required to communicate the data to the Ministry, in order to allow the monitoring and the progress of each individual intervention of the program"". The fact that the two computer programs do not communicate may be a fact, I do not blame you, but it is certainly the regional structure that must provide this data to the Ministry on a monthly basis. You told me that on the 17th you will have a meeting with the Ministry, I hope that, with all the millions that this regional administration is investing in digitalization, a way will be found to communicate between computers so that the data is correctly reported. The press, in this case, has done nothing other than spread the updated table of the Undersecretary of Health, Marcello Gemmato, which he released this autumn; so in this case it is the Ministry that provided data, this data did not have, and today you explained to us a little why. That the Hospital structures have done their duty is sacrosanct, it is clear: they have created the places, the therapy is set up and works, so that is not the problem. The problem - and this is the spirit of initiative - is that the people of the Aosta Valley often and willingly find themselves classified at the bottom of the rankings, we are only above the Molise Region which has absolute zero, otherwise we are also at the bottom of this ranking, when instead money, work and commitment are spent to create structures that are in fact created. I therefore ask your Department, I ask the regional structures, I ask those who deal with IT, to see to communicating this data directly and correctly. That's all."
47933,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,4348,"English:What is the current situation in terms of availability and presence of general practitioners on site in the upper Valtournenche area, also with reference to the periods of greatest tourist influx. The ASL Company informs that from December 1st (therefore in view of the period of greatest tourist influx) in the Municipality of Valtournenche the outpatient activity will be guaranteed by a second doctor, in addition to the one already present. More generally, in the area of ​​primary care medicine, after years of work, studies and evaluations, last September 6th, in the Regional Committee of general practitioners, the regional supplementary agreement concerning territorial functional aggregations was signed. This is an important agreement, approved and made fully effective - a Copernican revolution, I wanted to say - by the Council with resolution 1160 of September 23rd, which lays the foundations for the reorganization of local medicine, also through the organization of work at future Community Houses, that is, at what were once called polyclinics. The discipline is in fact aimed at fully valorizing the skills and professionalism of the primary care physician in his unique role; in fact, alongside the ordinary activity of the family doctor, the so-called ""choice cycle"", based on the relationship of trust with the patient who chooses his own doctor, the hourly service activity is added, aimed at strengthening general assistance in the territory, thus guaranteeing a 24-hour service at what are the Community Houses and that is the former polyclinics. Therefore, primary care doctors, in addition to continuing their activity at the usual clinics, will also be able to provide services at the Community Houses, or polyclinics, where direct access clinics will allow patients to have a doctor who can respond to their health needs: hence the Copernican revolution mentioned above, also linked to the fact that general practitioners, in their centrality, will collaborate in staff with a whole other series of figures, health, social-health and social-assistance. Coming to the well-known national shortage of general practitioners, it is important to inform you that in our Region, in contrast to the national trend, we received applications to participate in the competition for specific training in general medicine for all ten places available and eight of them then showed up for the exam. Another positive signal is given by the training course that ended last October 29, which saw four trainees enter fully to support the Aosta Valley regional health service. Of these, three doctors, already assigned with the ceiling of 1,000 patients, will be able to expand their ceiling to 1,500 patients, thus guaranteeing further spaces of choice for our community. We are certainly aware that these numbers do not yet represent a full resolution to the need for family doctors, but it is a positive fact, as is also demonstrated by the interest shown in the degree course in nursing that saw the Aosta Valley, perhaps as the only faculty, with all thirty available places filled. It should also be noted that to ensure assistance, especially for fragile patients, two direct access clinics are active at the Municipality of Valtournenche, on Tuesdays from 10:00 to 13:00, and at the Antey-Saint-André clinic on Mondays from 14:00 to 17:00. Assistance to tourists in the summer period is guaranteed in the Valtournenche clinic by four doctors from 15 July to 23 August 2024, who ensure the activity from 8:00 to 14:00, or from 10:00 to 16:00. In the winter period, with a greater influx of tourists, assistance is also guaranteed through the activities that are carried out at the Trauma Center; always at the Municipality of Valtournenche, these services are added to the continuity of care, which was once called medical guard, active on weekdays in the time slot from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am and on pre-holidays and holidays with 24-hour coverage."

So I believe that soon we will have the incarnation of this proposal which, of course, being innovative in some ways, required a necessary study by all the subjects involved, both at the assessor level and in terms of health management. Of course, a project of this kind must be absolutely applauded in terms of ideas, but it must also then be fitted in with the availability of professionals, which always remain difficult."

Considering that the area is characterized by other plant networks under existing services, before starting the works, it was necessary to spend additional time to carry out the preliminary shifts on the electricity and gas networks. Since last September 16, the maximum number of bicycles that can park inside the Parini area is expected to be equal to the number of spaces present in the fenced area, i.e. 51 bicycles. The spaces are almost entirely located in the north-west area, on the corner of Via Chaligne and Via Parigi, where the shelter with thirty covered spaces is already present today, except for four spaces already present in the square near the entrance to the thermal-purification plant. The other spaces present and scattered in the area will all be relocated near the shelter, so as to arrange them in a single area for bicycle parking. The entrance to the area must take place with bicycles in hand via the pedestrian access for users, passing inside the guardhouse, block A. The route to reach the spaces must follow the internal road on the north side of the Parini Hospital. Once the maximum number of bicycles inside has been reached, any other bicycles will be directed to the multi-storey car park and outside the fenced perimeter. There are sixty-six other public indoor bike parking spaces that can be used by staff, given the proximity and direct connection to the hospital area, although they are not reserved for USL staff. The ban on access to the area remains for motorcycles. These provisions will obviously be updated in the presence of new circumstances that may cause interference with the safety of anyone passing through the hospital perimeter."

First of all, last time you basically called us a few of those who don't understand anything, saying: ""But it's obvious, there's a construction site in there, how can you transit with bicycles?"". Note well: in the area you mentioned, that is where there is the shelter and everything else, there hasn't been any construction site anywhere, there hasn't been any construction site, none, I pass by regularly but the staff also pass by there every day and haven't seen any construction site. Since, after four months of this obligation, you also told us... when we presented the question, telling you: ""it's absurd that you don't allow bicycles to be parked in the Hospital when there are spaces"", you said to us: ""But what's the problem? There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of parking spaces inside the Parini parking lot, so they can be put there"". Then I hope I'm not bothering you too much with my reply, Councillor, and I hope it's not too much trouble if I talk to you... President, that's fine, let's call, let's do it, next time I'll give the same attention, do you think it's all normal? Excuse me, if I only ask for a minimum of attention. I'll do the same with two phones, maybe I'll turn my back next time when you answer me. I was saying, you told us that there were lots of parking spaces available, so we were fools who didn't understand how, in reality, one could park. No construction site was built, no passage was allowed, the external fence of the Hospital filled up with bicycles locked with padlocks, because all these hundreds of parking spaces that were there for bicycles were evidently not enough, four months later the ban was lifted on 16 September. We ask ourselves: ""Why? It's probably because the construction site is already finished, the Hospital is in order, there will be the new Hospital and it has been finished"". Actually, no, I read carefully and I see the internal communication of the USL that says: ""As is known, every year the Municipality of Aosta adheres to the European mobility week"", which will take place from what day? From September 16, exactly from when the regulation ceases to have any functionality, that is, practically until September 16th inside the Hospital you could not park your bicycle, then the European mobility week arrives and from the 16th the regulation is revoked and you can park your bicycle inside again. Coincidentally, but it must surely be almost a coincidence, on September 21st the cycle path of the Municipality of Aosta is inaugurated, but it must have been a coincidence for sure. Then you understand that the employees of the USL are not stupid, look, with their little bicycle they go inside, they have also equipped themselves with these things because unfortunately the city has been made unlivable by the cycle paths, they equip themselves with bicycles, they are prevented from parking them. Then the USL organizes the bicycle week, and on the very day that week begins, the regulation is revoked and from that moment on you can park, and now you come to tell us, Councilor, that in reality it is because: ""Oh no, but the construction site has been made safe, so there are spaces"". Councilor, but let's not kid ourselves, do things based on what you want to do, do things based on what is convenient for you, giving the most absurd reasons. This is a small thing, but it is the small thing that shows that perhaps someone is thinking they can call the shots. You said that in reality there is a certain part of the structure that does things independently, and we don't think so, it seems to us that instead someone perhaps wants to go in a certain direction, it seems to us that someone perhaps enjoys harassing the employees and when they are caught red-handed, and when they are made aware of the problems, then perhaps they wake up. However, this is a strange coincidence, Councillor, and I hope it will remain on record, and above all that whoever made this regulation then retired and saw it revoked, will know well the foolishness he committed."
47935,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,4320,"Question no. 1: what has been the average expenditure over the last five years for the purchase of medical consumables by the Aosta Valley Health Authority? The ASL Company has communicated that, for the last five years, therefore the period 2019-2023 included, the average expenditure for the purchase of medical consumables has been equal to 8,935,133 euros. In more detail, the average expenditure has been equal to 8,269,216 euros for 2019; 8,934,097 euros for 2020; 8,459,369 euros for 2021; 8,717,358 euros in 2022; 10,295,623 euros in 2023, therefore also following the ever-increasing allocations given to our regional health service. Coming to question no. 2 (what is the procedure and which bodies are involved in the purchasing decision process for the material in question), the procedures relating to the purchase of medical material, in particular medical devices, are governed, as you can imagine, by the public procurement code which, in the 2019-2023 period, has undergone periodic corrections, until the adoption of the current new procurement code pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023, by the Prime Ministerial Decrees of 24 December 2015 and 11 July 2018. These Prime Ministerial Decrees, respectively, identify and integrate the product categories of goods and services for which, pursuant to Legislative Decree 24 April 2014 no. 66, the national health service bodies are required to use Consip Spa or other aggregating entities, therefore Single Procurement Centres, in carrying out the relevant purchasing procedures. Therefore, the USL Company uses codified procedures in the activities of programming, design, assignment and execution of contracts for the purchase of medical devices, procedures that transversally involve all the administrative and healthcare structures of reference. In this procedure, the USL Company is closely supported by the central purchasing bodies, namely Inva Spa first and foremost, as the regional reference body and aggregator for the product categories referred to in the above-mentioned Prime Ministerial Decrees, and by other national central purchasing bodies through adherence to framework agreements, i.e. codified contractual methods for the optimization of purchases. Coming to question no. 3 (what are the post-purchase quality verification procedures for the material in question), the structures in charge of the purchasing procedures regularly interface with the healthcare structures that use the purchased medical devices. The pursuit of the result in healthcare purchases cannot ignore a continuous comparison between the party using the goods and the party that takes care of the purchase. This comparison is aimed at optimizing the exchange of information relating to both the need and the type of use of the goods in question. Any situation of discrepancy between the quality of the purchased good and the good received is reported to the purchasing structure by the user structure. This determines the activation of a comparison between the purchasing structure and the supplier company, a comparison aimed at resolving any non-conformity of the product. This phase may determine, in some cases, also a replacement of the product that does not meet expectations with another product and, where necessary and permitted by contractual regulations, also the replacement with a product from another supplier. We also highlight that the structures that use medical devices maintain a constant dialogue with patients and patient associations, and in this sense it is important to underline that their opinion, as direct users of the devices, is also taken into consideration as far as possible. This naturally applies to all associations, including diabetics. To the above, for completeness of information on the subject, we finally add that the attention to the quality, functionality and above all the safety of medical devices is also guaranteed by the activity of the network for device-vigilance that involves the Department, the USL Company and the competent representatives of the Ministry of Health in continuous discussions, comparisons and exchanges of information, always to protect patients and guarantee care."

First of all, it is important to underline how significant the expenditure is, because you told us - now I took some notes very quickly - an average expenditure of almost 9 million per year, with over 10 million exceeded in 2023, so we are talking about truly significant expenditure for the community. As regards the purchasing procedures, it is clear that there are constrained procedures that have administrative procedures that must be observed, so we know about Consap, we know about these bodies that sometimes proceed to make purchases, through tenders perhaps autonomously, other times by associating with other bodies. The substantial problem is then precisely that of post-purchase control, that is, once the material and devices are applied and used by healthcare workers, there is probably some criticality there, because it is true that there will be a device-surveillance network, the fact that you tell us that the various interested parties interface regularly, I don't think it is always so easy to interface with the supplier companies when perhaps they are from Taiwan or who knows where, because this has already happened, so I think it is quite a significant problem, this. What has been reported to us of course by medical workers, and not only, is that sometimes these materials are quite poor quality, and I understand that it is not always a direct responsibility of the bodies that are part of the Health Authority, because in fact, as we were saying before, there are procedures to follow, sometimes you join up with someone else, who knows, who buys plasters or syringes, and then your package arrives and you take note of what has arrived, of course. Perhaps, however, from what has been reported to me, that there is not this immediate reaction, therefore these verification procedures and continuous interfacing that you have told us about... in my opinion, but I say this very cautiously, of course, because judging the work of others is always easy, but sometimes you are wrong, but I believe that this procedure could be improved in this respect. I reserve the right to return to this point again after having done some further research and having carefully read what was your response."

The aforementioned parking spaces are disabled parking spaces at the Via Guido Rey site. The ASL Company informs that at the polyclinic on Via Guido Rey, work is underway to build what will become the Aosta Community House, which, as is known, will be funded by PNRR funds and there is no need to represent the urgent timescales for this type of project. The works, among other things, are aimed at creating a new access to the facility with an operation to remove architectural barriers for all categories of users: disabled, elderly, visually impaired, etc. These activities, which we are aware cause some temporary inconvenience - coming to the previous question, the fact that you think I could be so diabolical as to establish the entrances and exits from a construction site like that of the G3 things, in some ways also makes me feel much stronger and more powerful than I am -, have required a reorganization of the parking spaces for employees, for employees with disabilities and for disabled users. The current works have in fact significantly reduced the number of internal parking spaces between the company buildings on Via Guido Rey. The Company informs that three dedicated spaces have been created for disabled users who need to access the polyclinic; the other spaces are intended for company cars and the operators have been made aware of their correct use. Users in possession of the blue coupon for disabled people can also park for free in the blue spaces or in the spaces reserved for disabled people on Via Guido Rey. We trust that at the end of the work in progress, a comprehensive and satisfactory allocation of parking spaces can be restored to meet all needs, from those of companies to those of users and, even more so, those of disabled users."
47936,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,3808,"I would like to clarify for a moment what the issue is. One day I happened to be passing by that very street, namely Via Guido Rey, and I was called by a disabled person who had to park there, and who actually found the parking spaces completely occupied by USL cars, moreover I also published a photograph that proves it.... I know you know, but I will also quote the article, don't worry. I take note of this parking lot and therefore I take a photograph to testify, because perhaps if I hadn't had the photograph they could have also told me that I was making things up, and obviously, since there was no Regional Council, I thought it appropriate to publish everything, so that perhaps something would move. Now imagine my dismay when I read exactly what you just told me, that is, the USL responds: ""According to what was reported by the USL Company"", this is the article that was then made following an interview requesting explanations, ""the temporary use of the internal parking lot, between number 1 and number 3, is reserved exclusively for users and employees with a blue coupon certifying their disability"" and so far so good, then there are three words: ""and company cars"". You see, Councilor, I understand everything, the needs of the PNRR and we need to finish everything, but imagine being a person with a disability and having a place under your house, where you park your car. You arrive and can't find your place, do you know why? Because someone who has to move house has arrived, parked his van there and says: ""Okay, but this is a place for people with disabilities"" and also for vans if you want to move, because unfortunately I have to do it urgently, so it's not like I can just stand here and wait. Now you will understand that this explanation to the person with disabilities will certainly not be enough, because it is clear that if a space has a very specific sign, which is the one reserved for people with disabilities, it is not a space reserved for USL service cars. That space is reserved exclusively for people with disabilities. There is no construction site, PNRR or construction site that can overcome this obstacle. The fact that you stubbornly defend the USL line that says that service cars can park there is simply shameful and disgusting, since you deal directly with disabilities. Anyone who deals with disabilities and tolerates that company and USL cars can be parked in spaces exclusively intended for disabled people, and justifies it with reasons of urgency, is objectively not doing their job, they are doing it very badly. Very badly therefore, Councilor, very badly for the USL offices that justified this to you. Moreover, I would also like to say one thing: there are works of the PNRR financed with millions and millions and millions of public money and a person who stopped for a moment to think: ""Mumble, mumble, mumble, but where can we put the machines when this space is occupied?"" was not there, they thought of something completely different, except where to put the cars and how to allow disabled people and people with disabilities to park. Moreover, people with disabilities are the first to be angry, because they can't find a place and it's all well and good to say that you can park with a ticket even in blue spaces; it's true, but there's no room, that's why there's a courtyard with a bar that's reserved for people with disabilities who go there to get health services. Objectively, Councilor, this explanation doesn't satisfy us at all, in my opinion the conduct of the USL and the management of those spaces is absolutely shameful. We remain convinced of this and obviously the issue doesn't end there."
47937,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico, ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5674,"English: Before answering the questions raised on the topic brought to your attention, we believe it is necessary to briefly recall the recent provisions adopted with Legislative Decree no. 137 of 1 October 2024, containing ""Urgent measures to combat the phenomena of violence against healthcare professionals, social healthcare professionals and auxiliaries of assistance and care in the exercise of their functions, as well as damage to goods intended for healthcare"". As is known, this Legislative Decree has made some changes, even to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, and has included severe penalties in the event of damage to healthcare and social healthcare facilities and in the event of attacks on healthcare personnel. This is to say that the topic of violence and aggression, given healthcare personnel, is - unfortunately - very current and has such a scope that it is necessary to proceed with provisions to stem, as far as possible, the phenomenon. The problem, therefore, is of a community nature. Coming to the questions raised in the question: no. 1""The number of episodes of violence against healthcare workers at our healthcare facilities in the last year and the places most subject to such episodes"". The number of verbal and physical attacks recorded in 2023 at the healthcare facilities of the Local Health Authority is increasing compared to the annual data recorded in the three-year period 2020-2022. Based on the monitoring carried out, the episodes of violence committed at the facilities of the Local Health Authority against healthcare and social-health professionals in the exercise of their functions in 2023 are in fact 32, compared to the 18-20 annual reports referring to the three-year period mentioned above. The facilities most involved are psychiatry, with 25%, the emergency room, with 13%, and the territorial area, with 15%. In relation to the current year, considering the data processing period between 1 January 2024 and 30 September 2024, 28 assaults were reported, 14 of which involved the psychiatry department. In evaluating the data, the peculiarities of the users who access the mental health department must be taken into account, of course. As regards the other hospital departments, however, there has been a decrease in the number of reports of the episodes in question, which generally amount to one or two cases per facility. Coming to question no. 2, ""The measures adopted at the regional hospital and the facilities in the area"", the Usl company, starting from December 2022, has adopted a new company software, called ""Talete"", for the management of clinical risk. With the launch of the new IT program and with the awareness and training campaign for healthcare personnel, there has been greater attention from the personnel themselves to proceed with the reports. The ASL company also has a specific procedure in place that provides guidance for the prevention of acts of violence against Aosta Valley ASL company workers. The aim is to provide all workers with the necessary guidance to recognise aggressive verbal and non-verbal behaviour, in order to prevent situations of tension from degenerating into episodes of violence and, in this sense, measures are suggested to workers to reduce the risk of aggression by users and to spread the practice of immediate use of reporting tools for any episodes of violence. The staff of the preventive medical and risk management structure of the ASL company collaborated with the strategic management in reviewing the company information contained in a poster placed in the common areas of the company itself, in order to inform and raise awareness among users of the possible consequences of aggressive acts. Ministerial recommendation no. 101 was also published on the company website and distributed to healthcare workers. 8, i.e. the recommendation to prevent acts of violence against healthcare workers, aimed at preventing acts of violence through the development of measures that allow the elimination or reduction of risk conditions present in the healthcare context, in addition to the acquisition of skills by workers in assessing and managing such events. Finally, the preventive medicine structure and the risk management of the Usl company report that the data cited above are related to reports received via company software. It is not possible to know how many resulted in complaints to the police. At the Department of Mental Health, the Local Health Authority has activated a private security service with a deterrent function, as these are structures that are more at risk due to the characteristics related to user problems. At the emergency room of the Parini hospital, the police force is present from Monday to Saturday, from 7 am to 1 pm. On holidays and at night, the service is covered by on-site surveillance. Finally, we inform you that the competent structure of the Department is working with the Local Health Authority to establish at the regional level, in accordance with the regulations in force on the matter, the Center for the management of health risks and patient safety. In this way, those activities that the Region already currently carries out in the area of ​​recognition and communication of risks and adverse events will be formalized and made structural."

From the data you provided us, surely many of these are linked to the users, because, if we talk about the psychiatry department and the emergency room, we are very likely to find ourselves in cases of this type. It would perhaps also be interesting to understand how many of those reported cases were in the facility perhaps for phenomena of alcoholism or drug addiction, because perhaps, also from this point of view, it would be interesting to understand the reasons for the attacks: if linked to pathologies and to a specific user or if instead linked to tensions that can arise, perhaps due to long waits or for other reasons. Since the presence of a software was represented to us - and I imagine that data of this type is also put in that software - perhaps we will access the documents to better understand what the reasons for these attacks are."
47938,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico, ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,12876,"English: With regard to the outcome of the discussion with the political party, it should be clarified that the reorganization of the staffing plan was naturally adopted independently by Jean Boniface Festaz, with a resolution of the Board of Directors dated August 13, and was then approved by the regional government, with resolution no. 1188 of September 30. The redetermination of the staffing plan is part of the necessary expense management process, a process requested by the Region, which the company is pursuing. With regard to the technical assessments that led to the determination and reduction of staff, we report what was reported by Jean Boniface Festaz. The company recalls that in the previous allocation there was no presence of health services (which were introduced with the amendment made by regional law no. 12 of July 29) and that in the social-health services the employees referred to the professions and operators of health interest assigned to the services of a more social-health nature were assigned in a cumulative manner. The number of OSS, which constitutes over 60% of the total employees, has been, in its complexity, reduced from 75 to 78 units, identifying the number of operators assigned to each of the three types of services: nursing home with protected and protected plus type service, social-health with the temporary residential number for dementia and health with the community hospital soon to open, the equipment of which is indicated in the project of specific interest between the Region, the Usl and the Jean Boniface Festaz, shared with the trade unions and approved with resolution no. 824/2023. Here it is useful to specify that the number of OSS has been reduced compared to the previous one operating in the RSA-UAP service, in compliance with what was defined in 2023 also with the trade unions, with respect to the return of personnel temporarily placed in service at the Usl company, pending the completion of the community hospital. The J.B. Festaz confirms that it has safeguarded the staff with the resources indicated in the organizational chart in addition to the minimum standards required at national and regional level, with all the permanent employees already employed in the former RSA-UAP. In this case, it is absolutely useful to inform that, as regards the minutes per person which are expressed in 120 minutes, the J.B. Festaz is around 170 minutes per patient, therefore well above the minutes required by current legislation, and that also in terms of service provided, in terms of cost or investment in the people who are at the Jean Boniface Festaz, we are well above the standards of the protected and protected plus regional. As regards the dementia unit, in the socio-health OSS service, the OSS resources indicated are those currently operating. Compared to the OSS operating in the socio-welfare service of the nursing home - the largest in terms of employment is 69 beds - the J.B. Festaz is around 170 minutes per patient, therefore well above the minutes required by current legislation, and that ... Festaz explains that it has produced and used the scientific model that defines itself as a professionalizing care model. The company then emphasizes the application of the model that avoids staff replacements for absences under 60 days, a measure aimed at containing costs (for which a commitment was made with our letter of February 20, 2024, to clarify the 2024 budget forecast) which, after being introduced as an experiment, has entered into force in a definitive form. The change, which is also minimal - one resource in the number of OSS assigned overall to the sub-departments of the nursing home - is essential and functional to guarantee internal substitutability without resorting to additional contracts for replacements. This therefore generates not increases, but reductions in personnel costs and minutes provided, while still guaranteeing assistance well above the minimum prescribed, which is why I have just now represented this great respond of minutes to Jean Boniface Festaz, without a significant impact on the quality of the service provided, thanks to the optimization process underway. Regarding the reduction of units in the auxiliary services area, this concerns the concierge service which, with the technological modernization of the company telephony, no longer has the function of hub for all incoming calls, which are now direct, and will therefore be able to see a more limited operating time than the current one, with the consequent savings. In order to consider the possibility of reassigning OSS staff with limitations to the role of concierge, the nursing home reports that there are currently no vacant positions in the concierge service and that the hiring mentioned in the initiative is related to temporary coverage that became necessary in relation to a not brief absence of a person in permanent service. I will now answer the questions relating to the initiatives of colleague Aggravi. With respect to the conciliation attempt initiated by the unions against Jean Boniface Festaz, the regional offices of the competent prefectural services have communicated that the same, following the meetings held, had a negative outcome. As you know, the Councilors cannot participate in these conciliations at the prefectural offices. However, it is useful to clarify that in the context of the discussion the management of the company J.B. Festaz expressed its willingness to proceed with a competitive procedure for the hiring of nurses and that, starting in 2025, it will be possible to allocate additional resources for staff replacements. The company also reported that two of the six vacant OSS positions in the social-assistance services area will be stabilized shortly, while another four positions are covered by permanent staff, temporarily assigned to the nursing home and who will transfer to the future community hospital. Responding to any meetings between the trade unions, the nursing home and the regional counterparts, as specified above, the social partners and the governance of the nursing home met within the scope of the conciliation attempt procedure mentioned above. Although not a direct party to this formal procedure - as was further clarified to all those present at the conciliation table - we nevertheless met with the social partners last October 29, as requested by them, considering it useful to clarify to them the path that led to the recognition of extraordinary resources to the nursing home over the last six years. I believe, as also attested by the same trade unions, that the meeting was also fruitful to clarify the important regional commitment made to support the care activity of Jean Boniface Festaz. In fact, we went from approximately 2.7 million euros granted in 2018, six years ago, to 5.2 million euros allocated for the current year, only for the social-care part. As regards the social-health services, until the end of August 2023 the Usl company had two agreements in place with the J.B. Festaz company: one relating to the RSA UAP service and one for the Alzheimer's and dementia unit. The first ceased at the end of 2023, when work began on the construction of the community hospital, while the second is still effective. For the RSA UAP service, the Usl company provided the J.B. Festaz company with 5.2 million euros. Festaz approximately 1.5 million per year, for the Alzheimer's and dementia unit the expenditure committed by the Usl company is equal to approximately 300,000 euros per year. In light of the financial difficulties communicated by J.B. Festaz in the year of the review procedure of regional law 34/2004, already started by the two departments of the Department, it was necessary to intervene urgently and as a priority on article 12, concerning the assets of the sources of financing. The need to update the financing regulation of J.B. Festaz was made explicit in the resolution of the Regional Council 346/2024 approving the three-year budget 2024-2026 of Festaz and in the resolution of the Regional Council n. 624 of 3 June 2024 approving the 2023 budget of the J.B. Festaz company. In these documents it was announced that the revision of 34/2004 was underway and that, as part of this revision, it was planned to modify the financing mechanism, in order to ensure adequate additional financial resources also for the social and health services provided by the company. Therefore, these changes were made in the first variation of the 2024-2026 budget forecast approved by this Council. More precisely, in analogy with the interventions already effective for social and welfare services, a co-participation in the operating costs relating to the health services (future community hospital) and social and health services (dementia unit) was introduced, up to a maximum annual amount of 35% of their amount. This contribution, financed with regional resources, will be provided by the Usl company within the contractual agreements in force with the J.B. Festaz facility. The approved measures provide for a maximum financial commitment in the regional budget of €400,000 for the year 2024 and €1,300,000 for 2025 and 2026. Still regarding social and health services, it is important to add that, in parallel with the interventions for contribution to operating costs - first with article 5 of regional law 27/2023 and subsequently with article 22, paragraph 3, letter i) of regional law 25/2024 - specific extraordinary compensation measures have been provided for the providers of accredited private social and health services. These measures, financed with regional funds and provided to the service managers by the Usl company within the scope of the existing agreements, are intended to contribute to the increased costs determined by the general increase in operating costs, including the costs for the next rounds of contract renewal. In this sense, the J.B. Festaz was paid an amount equal to 79,354 euros by the Usl company. Likewise, the general provisions for proceeding with the liquidation of the compensation for the 2024 financial year will also be approved. As the numbers make clear, the intervention was enormous and unprecedented. Colleague Aggravi, you are a person who not only pays attention to numbers, but also has a memory of numbers. After such a detailed response, there is certainly a need for a small summary. From a political point of view, this Council and the government in the last 18 months have made an intervention for the Jean Boniface Festaz which, from a social-welfare point of view, has seen, both for 2022 and 2023, the maximum amount of expenditure made available; with the intervention made then with law 12/2024, however, for the first time a classification of personnel has been made, in a clear and distinct manner, with respect to health and social-health functions. This, as just highlighted, will go to financial interventions in 2024 of 400,000 euros and in 2025 and 2026 of 1,300,000 euros. To those 5.2 million euros that we talked about, which were only 2.7 million in 2018, these expenses will also be added. From this we subtract the interventions that have been made in an extraordinary manner for the contract renewals and the interventions that you have requested in terms of investment, for example with regard to the 500,000 euros allocated for the famous water pipes. At this time, therefore, something made clear also by the right questions that have come from the trade unions, this Council and subsequently also the government, both in the action implemented by my predecessor, colleague Barmasse, then continued by the undersigned, we have arrived, in terms of social assistance, to allocate the maximum possible, with an extraordinary contribution in the amount of 1,600,000 euros. The per capita quotas have gone from 115-125 euros per person to the current 130-140, therefore also the sum of these per capita quotas has turned out to be, at this time, the highest possible; all this without providing for transfers for the social-health part. Having also changed the 34/2004 and having institutionalized the fact that in that facility, which has some of the highest minutes in the Aosta Valley, for each person who is assisted there is also health coverage that is not available elsewhere and having also provided for a financial allocation, which is what I have just mentioned, I believe that all of us can say that the effort made for the Festaz is certainly a concrete effort and that it has already happened."

Unfortunately, since there are two inspection initiatives to be discussed together, it has to be interrupted. Obviously I thank you for your response, net of a mistake that you made when you spoke of a reduction that goes from 75 to 78 units, perhaps it was the other way around, from 78 to 75. You said this, before, I would just like to ask for confirmation that it was just a mistake. Obviously I thank you for the response, which essentially unloads the critical issues on the reduction of staff on the choice of J.B. Festaz, which tells us that you have simply taken note of the request from the structure. It is clear that in the question we had presented we also asked about the outcome of the discussion with the political party; you say that the discussion with the political party is not planned, but in reality it took place, because we know it, and we also know about the irritation of the unions that there was in discovering this cut. If we had to summarize a bit the meaning of the answer you gave, we could say that everything was done in a workmanlike manner, that the minutes are obviously even higher, that we have exceptional treatment and that therefore that staff was almost surplus to requirements. Then you motivated this cut with an economic necessity, due to the critical issues that the structure reports from this point of view. I limit myself to observing the fact that, in our opinion, the solutions to be adopted could have been different, even though I think that they will have duly informed you - if they have not informed you, I will inform you - that a person who has worked in the structure since 2012 resigned yesterday. This can only highlight that there are problems in the structure, that critical issues among those who work there are unfortunately felt and that a climate of this type certainly does not help to carry out one's task, which unfortunately requires a lot of attention, with the necessary serenity. With respect to the suggestion of placing OSS staff in the concierge functions, he also tells us that this is a fixed-term contract, for an absence that will be quite long. I believe that, rather than depriving oneself of staff, perhaps the choice of placing people in another function... because it is not clear: you said that now we have everything computerized, so you no longer go through the concierge, but then the need to have a person in the concierge is there again, so it is not clear which of the two is actually the most popular thing. We note with regret the situation that has come to be created, especially because, if people who have worked in that structure for decades end up doing actions such as resigning, there are probably problems. Our concern is that in reality these critical issues and these tensions are not unloaded on the users, unfortunately, who, in the end, are absolutely blameless for all this. We therefore urge you to pay greater attention to the choices that will then be carried out with respect to the structure, so we take note of your response and await the evolution of events. Above all, we will discuss with the staff to evaluate what the next steps will be."

We are happy that you too, colleague Manfrin, appear when you hear the sirens of the unions. Welcome to the club. Having said that, in light of the current situation - and I certainly do not want to criticize the size of the commitment that the administration is making towards the nursing home - I would instead like to go back a bit. I also mentioned the other previous Assessors, if I forgot anyone I apologize, I excluded the interims because objectively sometimes it is complex. Having said that, there are two major problems relating to that reality, which I was already trying to explain in a very modest way even before the topic of the community hospital arose. There is a problem of financial structure - in fact the interventions that the Councilor spoke about are today an attempt to solve a problem that in reality does not arise today, but that arose previously - and on the other hand an organizational level problem. Allow me to make a consideration made by the man in the street: certainly the high playing time compared to other realities is a good and right thing, or it could be, because the man in the street could say that there is a higher playing time because there is a higher organizational need than other realities, therefore the organizational problem persists. The cooling and conciliation procedure is a plastic representation of the organizational problem, as I think there could also be a further problem - and in part it had already emerged in all the initiatives that the various colleagues have done - in the sense that those who are no longer at Festaz today, and have been moved, do not want to return to Festaz, therefore we have a further problem and we know very well what was the complicated area for moving, I have no other term, transferring or in any case allocating those human resources elsewhere. We therefore have a further problem and the weight of the replacements is there. The fact that with new funds it is then possible to carry out a procedure to increase the organic plant, among other things approved by the Usl company, is a further run for cover. The two problems, therefore, in reality persist. On the part of the financial structure, certainly the summary - and I thank you for the summary you have made - allows us to understand what the financial magnitude involved is, which burdens the governance of the nursing home with a further and greater responsibility and perhaps, as they would say in industrial economics, it is better to concentrate on the line, rather than on the administrative staff, and it is obviously necessary to also reduce the stress that exists in the organizational sphere, which then is or can be discharged on a better quality of service, a service that in any case has been, as we often rightly point out, always of quality. Now we have also learned that there will be a further union meeting. What we hope for is that there can be, on the one hand, a resolution to this high temperature, given that the procedure is a cooling-off, but that, beyond the individual procedures provided for by the laws that regulate union relations, there can be an internal, organizational cooling-off, above all useful for being able to have a resolution, perhaps not definitive, but that allows everyone to work in a more effective and more cohesive manner. We also hope that there can actually be a definition of the procedure relating to the executive body, therefore also to the General Management, in such a way as to better understand how the management will be managed. Certainly, unfortunately, it will not be the last initiative, but it is a set of initiatives, of which I think you can also appreciate the coherence and the attempt to resolve the problems. It is not a sporadic initiative."

With reference to the first question, i.e. whether the competent Councillor is aware of the bonus in question, the answer is yes. It is a tariff relief for domestic customers aimed at reducing the cost incurred for the supply of electricity to families in which there is a member who is in physical difficulty and who requires electromedical equipment to maintain life. The matter is regulated by the decree of the Ministry of Economic Development no. 28 of December 2007, which provides, in article 4, that the customer in possession of the requirements set out in the previous article submits a specific request to the Municipality of residence. The Municipality of residence, also through the IT support made available by the Ministry of Economic Development, evaluates and accepts the applications, upon presentation of the certificate issued by the local health authority to which they belong, attesting to the serious health conditions of one of the members of the family unit, such as to require, in fact, the use of medical-therapeutic equipment necessary for their existence in life and powered by electricity. As reported above and as also clearly reported on the institutional website of Arera, the competence to receive the applications is therefore of the Municipalities of residence and not of the Region, which does not even have, as written in the question, any function of collector of the applications, not having access to the IT system for the transmission of the same. To submit the applications, the Municipalities can also sign a onerous agreement with the tax assistance centers (CAF), by virtue of an agreement specifically signed between the Anci (National Association of Italian Municipalities) and the National Consultation of CAF. The text of the question refers to applications that were rejected by the Municipalities of residence of the interested parties and by the CAF, but without further details, which would have allowed a direct verification with the identified Municipalities. In any case, in a collaborative perspective, the offices of the Department of Social Policies have activated a discussion with Celva, receiving reassurances that this is indeed a competence of the Municipalities of residence of the interested parties and that Celva itself will send a note to all the Municipalities, reminding them of the ownership of this procedure, naturally copying the Department itself. The same offices of the Department of Social Policies have then also activated an informal discussion with a CAF, receiving as a response that the CAF are indeed authorized to receive and transmit applications for this measure, subject however, as mentioned above, to the stipulation of an agreement to this effect with the interested Municipalities."
47939,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,1757,"Thank you, Councilor, for your absolutely precise and timely response. I would like to point out that, hearing your response, someone might imagine that some competence has been attributed to the Region; in reality, this is unfortunately what some Municipalities have responded to, that is, some Municipalities have passed the responsibility for receiving the applications partly to the CAF, partly to the Region. It was therefore not clear, since the instructions are very clear on the Arera website, why there was no choice to collect these applications. I thank you above all for the awareness-raising part that was implemented with Celva and at this point we hope that it will no longer happen that responsibilities are passed between local authorities and, possibly, CAF or regional administration, because in this way the procedure will also be clear, so we will also be able to communicate to the families - unfortunately there are several dozen who have communicated this problem to us - that the issue is resolved. You rightly said that we did not indicate the Municipality: we did so deliberately because, as you know, the censorship that this Council often applies is very serious - some people long for it - but if we had also included more precise coordinates to identify which administrations had not provided adequate answers, had not taken charge of the questions, we would have risked unleashing ""so it is that person, it is that other one, let's discuss in secret or not"". So we cut to the chase and only highlighted a situation of discomfort that, I imagine, with the communication you announced to us will evidently be overcome. Thank you for your response."
47940,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5012,"Regional law 27/2023 provided for a temporary health allowance for the three-year period 2023-2025 for all non-medical veterinary health management and health professions, for the personnel of the health professions in the health sector, excluding nursing staff, who already benefited from the allowance under regional law 22/2022. This law also extended the allowance to all health personnel, including those under regional law 22/2022, even with part-time employment. The overall financial burden for the three-year period 2023-2025 was determined at 2.7 million euros, according to the calculations provided by the Usl company. The USL company then started the company-wide supplementary bargaining, establishing, in agreement with the trade unions, to pay the beneficiary staff the same monthly amounts as per regional law 22/2022, rather than, of course, the amounts proposed by its own bill, no. 65, which in fact instead provided for lower amounts to be paid than 22/2022. The amounts of bill no. 65 therefore - in a political bargaining that saw you, colleague Restano, and the government, arrive at finding an absolutely profitable solution for these employees - had naturally been calibrated with respect to the amounts mentioned above. The trade unions in fact agreed on the possibility of proceeding, however, to a balancing payment by the end of the year, if it were necessary to respect the total amount of the financing approved by law, which was precisely 2.7 million euros. In recent months the company has therefore been proceeding with the planned balancing payments. It is therefore not a question of a reduction in the temporary health benefit due to lack of funds, but of an ordinary accounting operation foreseen in the context of the union agreements that were signed within the company, linked to a balancing procedure. In short, when the union representatives and the company then had to apply, in a foreseen location, the application according to the amounts of 27/2023, it was in fact foreseen that there would be balancing if by the end of the year the money would be more or less; always within the maximum limit of 2.7 million. Before proceeding with the answers to the individual points of the question, it is important to clarify that the data provided concern the categories of workers contemplated by law 27/2023, which therefore excludes temporary staff, full-time doctors and nurses. Let's come to question no. 1, ""How many new hires were made by the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority during 2024, referring to non-medical health management and health professions excluding nursing"". The new hires made by the Local Health Authority during 2024, up to October, referring to non-medical health management, were 3, while those referring to health professions, excluding nursing, were 2. The terminations recorded by the Local Health Authority during 2024, up to October, referring to non-medical health management, were 2, while those referring to health professions, excluding nursing, were 13. ""Whether there were discussions with the company before proceeding with the adjustment"". The adjustment was made without providing for discussions between the Region and the Usl company, as these are not provided for, but established exclusively within the scope of the company-wide supplementary bargaining with the trade unions, so even what you reported during the discussion of the DEFR was absolutely relevant to what happened, but naturally all of this did not refer to what had been established when 27/2023 was applied, where it had already been agreed that the adjustment would be made by the end of the year. This amount was defined at the time on the basis, in fact, of the data provided by the competent structures of the Usl company, precisely within the scope of the company-wide supplementary agreements stipulated with the trade unions, both in the health sector and in the management of the health area. It was agreed that the payment of the allowance would take place through the recognition of the amounts established provisionally, therefore respectively in 350 euros and 800 euros; this, without prejudice, precisely, to the redetermination of the same within the month of December of each year, to guarantee compliance with the spending constraint. To protect everyone, with respect to the legitimate nervousness that may exist on the part of colleagues, the commitment that the government is making already in 2025 is to increase the allocation for 2025 of 27/2023, also thanks to the reports that have arrived."

He used the rest to explain to us in great detail and to summarize the situation. This question is preparatory to the discussion of the motion - which I hope will be discussed today - to which you have already given a partial answer, saying that the commitment of the Council is to finance what is missing for 2025. I therefore think that we will have the opportunity to appreciate the vote in favor of this motion. Having said that, allow me just one point: the proposed law on allowances was from 2022, I'll tell you the date, spring 2022. We waited a year for the majority to define all the procedures to arrive at recognizing this allowance, which is due for healthcare workers. The calculations that had been made at the time, in May, were completely different. Having said that, we appreciated that in negotiations the unions arrived at defining a different figure. This was the negotiation, evidently something did not work, or the reduction was already foreseen. We will have the opportunity to discuss it when the motion is discussed. For now, I thank you for all this data, let's take note of the number of terminations and the number of hirings, which will be very useful for (incomprehensible)."
47941,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SOCIALE,en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5914,"""What are the technical reasons why the PD for the assignment of the task of drafting a feasibility study aimed at the participatory review of the system of regional interventions of policies to combat gender violence does not include any indication regarding the fight against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation?"" Question 2: ""Whether another study has been assigned for this specific topic and with what indications"". Question 3: ""If not, whether it confirms that the bill that should be ready by summer 2025 will also include provisions for combating discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation"". Question 4: ""Whether the delivery date of the aforementioned study can be brought forward"". As has already been said several times in this chamber and as you have also pointed out, the process of reviewing law 4/2013, which considers the feasibility study to be necessary, has been operationally underway since last August. In answering the first question, a summary and generalized phrase was used in the executive order, which therefore does not go into detail. We confirm that the study, as we requested, will contain prevention, contrast and support interventions, in favor of women victims of violence, with or without minor children, and of those who suffer violence and/or are discriminated against and persecuted by virtue of their gender identity and sexual orientation. These are important aspects that we agree must be taken into consideration and that we believe should be included in the future framework law, as we have already stated several times in this chamber. In answering the second question, it goes without saying that no other task has been assigned to another subject, since the topic is already, as mentioned, included in the broader task mentioned above. With regard to the third question, it is confirmed once again that the new text of the law will also include what has been recalled, that is, any form of violence, which must be condemned. With respect to the delivery date of the study, we must bear in mind that the same - built in a participatory manner through the involvement of various bodies, subjects and actors in the territory - requires the appropriate times already envisaged. In any case, attention will be paid to the methodological process and - even if the presentation of the new rule before the summer of 2025 is not considered possible today - everything possible will be done to bring it forward. The times for sharing with the appointed subjects - colleague, you can easily understand this - cannot be imposed, because otherwise their participation would in fact be lacking. In fact, with a directive and imposed approach, the method that these times rightly impose would be called into question in this way, given the sensitivity of the topic we are talking about. We don't want to make you angry and reopen a whole series of issues, but we need to understand each other: if we apply the time variable to methodological and participatory processes, either we impose them and therefore remove the methodological part, or, as you might rightly say, if we let it go, at that point our intention could be to extend them. I understand perfectly, so I have absolutely not had a paternalistic attitude, I could not allow myself to do so towards you, I simply recall the final part of the previous discussion: fifteen days ago, on this topic, you very clearly highlighted that I was making you angry about this topic. This is the reason why, I say it right away, I am dwelling on this part of the process. I have absolutely no intention of limiting your ability to get angry with me, I can even understand that, but coming to the more technical and procedural aspects, the fact that in August, as we also exchanged informally, the mandate was given to arrive at this study which is the subject of the question at point no. 58 of this agenda of the Regional Council is absolutely not a process either to lengthen the times or to shorten them. It is simply that, if you want to arrive at the constitution of a framework law, the reference process, which among other things also arrived from the territory and which also fits in with a complex national legislation, which is not giving particular indications on this issue... if you want to take into consideration, from a methodological point of view, a participatory system, an administrative process that is not practically stepping on the accelerator at a national level, you must, consequently, find a fair balance between respect for a method that must take into account the demands of the territory and the time needed to ensure that, rightly, no one can think - because that is not the case - that we are trying to slow down these times, on the contrary. The choice (which was made by the Department, even before the undersigned arrived, and then by the undersigned, together with the V Commission and also together with your legitimate demands on this issue) makes it clear that there is absolutely attention. I have no intention of making anyone angry and I have no intention of getting angry when I am used as a scarecrow for those who want to slow down these regulatory processes, because that is not the case. At the moment in which one chooses, even in respectful terms, the administrative dictates of shared administration, which a decree-law has well identified by the Italian State, I believe that in fact those times of sharing must be respected, because I believe that the territory must participate in giving indications on such important issues in order to provide adequate solutions."
47941,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SOCIALE,en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,3924,"Councilor, the question arises from a very simple situation: in the last Council meeting you told us that it was your intention to bring the revision of the law to the floor in the summer of 2025, when we will be in the final stages of this legislature, and then you told us that an assignment had been given. I looked for this executive measure from the month of August and I must say that, when I read it, my dismay, which was already evident in the floor, increased, because the text makes no reference to the part related to discrimination based on gender orientation. Now you tell me that the sentence is summary and generalized, but the sentence is this: ""A study aimed at the participatory review of the system of regional interventions of policies to combat gender violence"". Nothing else is written. You say that the right timing is needed, that a participatory process is needed and that we must not impose forced marches on associations and all those who want to give their contribution. I, Councilor, remind you that the other time I spoke to you about three years because I was referring to the path of the legislature, but let's stick to the period in which this Department is led by you, so from March 2023, if I'm not mistaken: in May 2023, so we're talking about about a year and five months ago, we were summoned, since a year had already passed since the filing of our proposed law, by the Department and we were told that there was the intention to review the law, the review of the law was underway and there would be room, in that review, also for the rules that we were requesting at the time. Now the assignment for the study was given in August 2024 and you say that time is needed. I understand that time is needed, but we know that this review is underway, at least that is the right date, from May 2023. So the years increase, the months don't increase, the years increase. English: Consequently, from May 2023 - when we were informed that the revision of law 4/2013 was being carried out, to today, and then to August 2025 - more than two years will have passed. The fact that the process of participation of the associations requires such a long time - and then obviously it is not only the time of participation of the associations, but also of the drafting of the study itself - seems to me not to be a desire to slow down the times, I am not saying that you are slowing down the times, what I am telling you is that you are not speeding up the times, they are certainly not being speeded up. This is clear for all to see. I also believe, I know this, that the associations that intend to participate in this process do not need to develop particular and specific requests, because they do not know the reality, they know it very well and they know that there is a need to move forward quickly. What proves it - the need also comes from reality - is that the situation in Valle d'Aosta, I'm talking about gender violence, has worsened, so it requires, also from the legislative side, not only from that of the police, a commitment, which must be additional in terms of timing. The other issue concerns discrimination based on gender orientation, which is not mentioned in the executive provision. I accept what you say, you confirmed to me that this will also be included in the law. I note that you did not mention ableism, so it means that then this will not be included, while we had understood that it should be included. I think I perceived, at the end of your speech, a willingness to try to push for shorter times. I sincerely hope that is the case. As for getting angry, Councilor, perhaps you should worry that I don't get angry because, being the Councilor for Health, if I have a fit I will also be a burden on the health system."
47942,XVI,07/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,2,2334,"Let's go back to talking about poker at the Casino of Saint-Vincent. In June we had asked the Council to understand if it was the intention of the casino, as other casinos in Italy already do - I am talking especially about Sanremo, which was the first, but now also Campione - to proceed with the organization of poker tournaments also in Saint-Vincent. Aware that these tournaments do not bring the so-called spending customers closer to the casino, but that in some way they promote admissions to the casino and in any case feed income, even if they are not so significant, and in any case create a strong increase in takings for the related industries, that is, for hotels, restaurants and above all for trade in general in the area. Also and above all on the basis of what was discussed in the last City Council of Saint-Vincent, where it was emphasized that the town's trade is in trouble, the same goes for Châtillon, and the convening of a single-issue Council on the crisis of the situation of trade in the area was requested. The resumption of the casino is certainly a positive element, especially for us it is very pleasing, but events and demonstrations of appeal that go well beyond just the day are required. We have received news of an assignment for the organization of new initiatives and new events. I have news that the first event that was organized, dedicated to the music of the Beatles, was a great success, so the resumption, in harmony with the casino and the territory, can and must go above all in that direction. The poker tournaments are certainly an attraction and a positive element that will attract from 3,000 to 6,000 people, this is clear. Given that the participating company has sent an adequate procedure to present an expression of interest in the organization of poker tournaments in Saint-Vincent; highlighted that the deadline for the presentation of expressions of interest expired on September 30; since we have no news, we ask the government if it is aware that three expressions of interest have been presented - we read this from the Gioco News newspaper - and in what time frame it is intended to proceed with the assignment of the management of the organization of the tournaments as well as when the first poker tournament in Saint-Vincent can be started."
47942,XVI,07/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,3634,"With regard to the first question, based on information from the casino, it is confirmed that three applications have been submitted and that the company bodies have already made an initial assessment. In these cases, the company implements the provisions of the current Purchasing Regulations, which provide that, in the event of a public notice of supplier selection, the selection is carried out through the establishment of an assessment committee, consisting of at least three members. At the end of the work, the committee will define the list of admitted candidates with a qualitative assessment and deliver it to the company management, for any due diligence, technical and economic, and subsequent commercial negotiations, which will include the analysis of the applications submitted (both in terms of form and merit) and the identification of the contractual scheme and the operational project. In this specific case, this project will subsequently be the subject of information to the regional administration for assessments relating to the regulations governing the relationship between the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta and the Casino de la Vallée. English: With regard to the second question, ""In what time frame do you intend to proceed with the assignment of the management of the organization of the tournaments"", the gaming house always informs us that the times for proceeding with the assignment of the management and organization of the tournaments are not foreseeable at the moment. Furthermore, a company was the victim of a very serious leak that led the Gioco News magazine to publish, on October 2, 2024, confidential information regarding the position of the three candidates who submitted the application and to express evaluations of merit on the same candidacies. It is emphasized that the deadline for submitting the application was set for September 30 and that before the publication of the Gioco News article, the commission responsible for analyzing the candidacies had not yet met to evaluate them and that therefore the relevant documents should not have been available to any employee of the company. The gaming house has opened an internal investigation, aimed at clarifying the events and, in any case, will proceed with the cancellation of the procedure, evaluating the methods and terms of the new expression of interest. The facts described are also the reflection of manifestations, on this topic, of an incongruous attention, media and otherwise, which interferes with the autonomy of the company and weakens its decision-making capacity, consequently also delaying the start of new projects. As regards the third question, ""When will it be possible to start the first poker tournament in Saint-Vincent"", the start of poker tournaments will therefore depend on the conclusion of the supplier identification procedure and the analysis of subsequent organizational problems. It is worth remembering, as already said on other occasions, that, despite having an interest in the topic of poker tournaments, the Casino de la Vallée company has not yet committed itself to their organization because the same, which has significant start-up and commercial investment costs, has not been included in the industrial plan approved within the context of the bankruptcy procedure in progress. In this regard, it is recalled that, pursuant to the ruling of the Council of State, section III, no. 2973, dated May 17, 2018, the organization of poker tournaments cannot be entirely entrusted to a third party, with the company remaining responsible for the management and control, payment management and participant registration, naturally with the related costs."
47942,XVI,07/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,6,613,"I start from your last statement: in reality the Campione casino and the Sanremo casino have started poker tournaments, there is certainly a path that can be taken, because I do not believe that they do poker tournaments outside the law. The other element of your response is extremely worrying and I invite you to provide us with information. I will stop here with respect to the reply because it does not deserve anything else, but it is absolutely worrying and the hope is that the gaming house can have the appropriate information as soon as possible to ensure that this path can restart with the maximum possible rules."
47943,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Finaosta",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,2,7035,"To introduce this interpellation, I will start from the guidelines containing the application discipline of law no. 20 on subsidiaries, adopted with resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022. Within the guidelines, article 5 expresses a principle: although public participation does not change the nature of the company as a private entity, the public nature of the sole or majority shareholder entails significant derogations from the general discipline and it could not be otherwise due to the nature of the capital employed, which comes from the community. It is a ruling by the Autonomies section of the Court of Auditors in 2021. In the context of the consolidated text of participating companies, in particular Article 19 - and the principles are contained in this resolution - reference is made to the fact that publicly controlled companies establish with their own provisions, criteria and methods for the recruitment of personnel, in compliance with the principles, including those of European origin, of transparency, publicity and impartiality, and there is a reference to Legislative Decree 165/2001. I quote this passage because I will return to it in the final part, hoping to have the time, given what I have to try to represent. Finaosta has adopted and effectively applied the provisions of the consolidated text, as well as of Law no. 20 and, obviously, on the basis of these guidelines it has adopted a regulation for the recruitment of personnel, always in consideration of the guidelines relating to 14 December 2022. I don't know if there is much to laugh about... but I'll move on, hoping that you will listen to me. In light of this, the guidelines tend, precisely, to indicate the need for subsidiaries to equip themselves with these regulations. In the same guidelines, at point C, in the context of the selection procedures for the recruitment of the managerial profile, it is stated: ""The selection procedures for the recruitment of managerial staff are always open"" - in full compliance, precisely, with the TUSP - ""Without any possibility of making vertical career progressions, classification in a higher qualification towards the managerial area, due to the different applicable discipline, notably deriving from the different level of bargaining, as well as from the different role and qualification compared to the area immediately below"". I simplify: manager against manager, no question. But there is another step that we must consider: point H of the same guidelines, ""Hiring of the general manager"", where provided for, obviously. ""Due to the peculiar high level of professionalism and activity carried out by the general manager"" - which, in the context of Finaosta, I recall, is not only subject to the TUSP, but also to the much more stringent Bank of Italy policy regulation - ""Of company management and organization, as well as the necessary relationship between this and the governing body of the company"" - the general manager himself in financial companies is an executive body, who has a very particular relationship and is not only the head of the organization, but is an even more particular manager - ""Companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Region must establish"" - always in reference to the TUSP - ""That the general manager is hired on a fixed-term contract"". It is then said, in the context of this point, and I will only dwell on the first words, that ""In the context of an open ordinary procedure the procedure is external"". It is true that the following point B provides for exceptional procedures, but it says: ""In a completely exceptional manner with respect to the ordinary procedure, controlled companies are given the possibility of proceeding, by assigning the role of general manager to an internal manager deemed to possess the requirements for the role itself, in compliance with the provisions set forth in the applicable collective agreements. In any case, the Board of Directors is required to provide adequate motivation regarding the possession of the requirements required for the assignment of the role. Please refer to point C for procedures"". There is a fact, and I'll get to the point: in light of these guidelines, the staff recruitment regulation was adopted. At the top there is the Constitution, then there is 165, with the TUSP, then there are the guidelines that the Region, the shareholder, gives to its subsidiaries, then there is the company statute and then there are the regulations. It is a sort of increasingly stringent funnel. The staff recruitment regulation states: ""The company, on the basis of the staff needs and the recruitment plan approved by the Board of Directors to identify the profile sought, carries out a preliminary check on the possibility of drawing on currently valid rankings. If this is not possible, or the verification returns negative results, the company activates a specific selection procedure"". But not only that, in the final part of the regulation it says: ""Without prejudice to the provisions of the relevant national collective agreement, for the hypotheses of assignment of higher duties, for the coverage of non-managerial work positions"" - therefore all non-managerial human knowledge - ""Created ex novo from those made vacant"" - but we are talking about non-managerial - ""Can experience specific internal progression procedures, and disciplines them"". Having said that, for everything that is managerial - I repeat - the regulation is more stringent, because it is a form of funnel compared to the guidelines - procedures must be experienced, obviously as provided for by the regulation itself and, in general, by the guidelines and the legislation that I have cited. In light of this, we question the President of the Region to find out: ""What are the reasons that led the regional financial company today to proceed with an internal progression for the replacement of the resigning general manager""; ""What other internal progressions will have taken place following the changeover at the General Management, or within the scope of the so-called organizational solutions cited in the Finaosta press release, within the scope of the declarations made upon the announcement of the resignation of the General Manager""; ""Whether within the scope of the choice made by the company, as cited in the previous point, there have been discussions with the company and, if so, with what results and, if not, why they were not started"" and ""Whether the President of the Region deems the choice made by the Board of Directors of the Finaosta company to proceed with the replacement of the General Manager with an internal progression procedure to be acceptable, compared to the methods chosen at the time for the appointment of the resigning person"". I hope the President will not be offended, but the delegation to the subsidiaries is, after all, to the effective owner of the entire regional administration."

Moreover, I believe that those in charge have made their decisions and assessments on the basis of the regulations in force, of this I am confident. With regard to the first question, that is ""What are the reasons that have led the regional financial company today to proceed with an internal progression for the replacement of the resigning general manager"", Finaosta informs that, with regard to point 1, the motivation on the basis of the identification of an internal resource for the purposes of the rotation of the general manager lies in the fact that said resource, in addition to possessing all the suitability requirements requested for the position in question, has been able to develop a high level of knowledge of the company's processes and dynamics, as well as of the resources in the workforce. Furthermore, the same, in carrying out the governance activity in the business area of ​​the company, has confirmed full alignment with the company's strategic directions. These elements represent an important added value, clearly not found in external candidates, given the need to ensure immediate continuity in the company's operations. At point 2: ""What other internal progressions will take place following the changeover of the General Management, or within the so-called organizational solutions cited by the President of Finaosta S.p.a. in the statements made upon the announcement of the resignation of the General Manager"". With regard to point 2, Finaosta highlights how the rotation of the General Management will be accompanied by the establishment, reporting directly to the General Management and with powers to replace it, of a coordination department of the so-called ""Staff Division"", including the organizational units that are not directly involved in the credit process and the obligations relating to administration, accounting, finance, supervisory reporting and management control, as well as the establishment, reporting directly to the departments referred to in the previous point, of 2 additional departments: on the one hand, the governance department, ""Services and studies"", with the function of supervising operations relating to the human resources function, the organization function, the information systems service, the newly established studies and advisory service, the Coa service, the legal service, general affairs, the regional regulatory consultancy service, the data protection office, internal contact; on the other hand, the ""Participations"" department, with the function of supervising operations relating to the Participations office and the strategic consultancy service. The organizational solution decided upon - in addition to ensuring that the company's operations can continue without interruption - aims to pursue two main objectives, considered fundamental for maintaining the current levels of performance over time, both qualitative and quantitative. The first translates into identifying a top management ready immediately to assume the operational leadership of the company, with full alignment with the strategic directions identified by the shareholder and the Board of Directors, both to guarantee the maintenance of the directions identified, in order to achieve the objectives assigned to Finaosta in terms of positioning and development of the services provided for the benefit of the regional socio-economic fabric. The second, accessory to the first, but no less important, leverages the time factor. In order to achieve medium-long term strategic objectives, it was deemed necessary to identify resources who, due to their work experience, can guarantee solid and lasting leadership of the company. Finally, and more generally, it is highlighted that the solution is an appropriate alignment of the structure to the main canons of corporate organization, which suggest that the same, where possible, take into account an adequate distribution of responsibilities attributed to the top operational bodies. This is answered by the identification of three new management figures, who will act, not only operationally, in support of the General Management. With regard to the third question, namely ""Whether in the context of the choice made by the company, as cited in the previous point, there have been discussions with the same, if so, with what results and if not for what reason were they initiated"", it is confirmed that, since this is a reorganization with a marked strategic value, the organizational solution was previously brought to the attention of the shareholder, who confirmed full trust in the administrative body of the company. English: For the fourth question, ""Whether the President of the Region deems it acceptable to choose the Finaosta Board of Directors to proceed with the replacement of the general manager with an internal progression procedure compared to the method chosen at the time for the appointment of the resigning director"", the fourth question seems almost posed at the level of personal curiosity, or as a sort of analysis of satisfaction. I can safely answer that the correct and effective discussion with the presidency of Finaosta concluded with full and broader confidence in the fact that the choice had to be an unconditioned expression of the President of the financial company and its Board of Directors. If I have to express an opinion, however, I fully share and appreciate the same in guaranteeing, first of all, full and immediate operational continuity, which other options would not have guaranteed. This must be added to the personal esteem for the person in charge who, from what I have had the opportunity to appreciate and for what my evaluation, which is not due, is worth, is a serious, motivated, passionate person, as well as technically prepared and competent."
47943,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Finaosta",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,6,2805,"I'll start from the end. The last question can be dismissed as personal curiosity, it is certainly an uncomfortable question, but those who have great responsibilities sometimes have to answer uncomfortable questions. In reality it was much simpler: why was a selection made previously and not today? Above all I ask myself a question... I say this because the other time it was you too, President, so I evaluated this, there was no other person. This question was asked, I received the answer, fine, I take note of it. The fact is this: two aspects were represented in the answer. I will summarize one like this: you rightly said that the top management had to be ready immediately to respect the objectives assigned by the Region partner and then you also made it a question of timing. Very well, but I ask myself one thing, in a provocative way: how can an organization be promptly active in responding to the objectives assigned by the Region partner, if it does not respect the directives that the Region partner gave it, with a resolution still in force, until proven otherwise, but above all not respecting its own internal regulations. Because the issue is this: often the participating companies - rightly so, especially for those with a private organization - complain about the great bureaucracy of governance that the Region does on them, but if a regulation is adopted by the same company, why is it not respected? The real problem is not all the discussion I made previously on the regulatory sources, but it is simple, two lines! The Finaosta regulation, which I understand is still valid, says something even clearer. Excluding a whole series of possibilities, why has it not been respected? This regulation does not even provide for the emergency solution, which instead is eventually provided for in the guidelines. This is the absurdity. Don't turn the question on people, because I could also say that on some occasions external selections did not allow the participation of internal resources, who during the life of Finaosta have grown and could bring their experience and the work they had already done. Instead they were not able to participate in those selections, because in the announcement it was foreseen so, among other things for positions inferior to that of the role of general manager. I repeat: I did not write this regulation, nor did the regional administration write it, Finaosta wrote it. So I say to myself: how can we say today that there was a need to have a prompt response to respect the objectives assigned by the Region partner, if then an in-house subsidiary company, that is, an arm of the administration, does not respect the regulations it has given itself? I am worried."
47944,XVI,07/11/2024,"AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE, Ordinamento degli uffici e del personale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,7925,"As President Testolin will remember well, we had already addressed this issue a few sessions ago. This issue had emerged in all its virulence when some unions, together with numerous political acronyms, which I believe have never existed in history - I believe they are acronyms composed of a single person, probably - had published a leaflet, on the intranet dedicated to the employees of the Region, against differentiated autonomy. This had already allowed a whole series of political evaluations on the merits. A particularly questionable phrase had also been inserted on this leaflet, where it was stated that ""Saying no to differentiated autonomy meant defending the Constitution born from anti-fascism as a struggle and as a value that the fascists in government today want to dismantle"". If differentiated autonomy also gives us the possibility, possibly, in the face of the opening of a table, to also expand the possibilities for our Region, probably, President, you will be a little fascist too. If there is the possibility of modifying our Special Statute, she will probably be a little fascist too. Maybe she will have to be careful and watch her back a little from the unions, but we will see what the path will be - regardless, that's for sure. The thing is that we found it in extremely bad taste, so much so that a series of protests had come out and, in the face of these protests, the unions, whining, had then removed this poster to replace it with another national one. I had then presented an interpellation on this topic. The curious and amusing thing is that - in response to my request to have greater sensitivity, greater attention to what was published - she had responded in a way that was absolutely understandable, saying that she would then sensitize the structures, that the structures had already taken steps to sensitize for a more focused use of the union noticeboard. Imagine my shock when I see that the same union, the main signature that had signed this manifesto, then issues a press release against my interpellation and publishes it on the union noticeboard. We asked to raise awareness to put on the union noticeboard only those communications that have a union relevance and the union issues a press release and, instead of sending it to the newspapers, publishes it on the intranet noticeboard, to respond to my interpellation. My interpellation is anything but union-related, obviously, but it is a political inspection act. Here we can absolutely exclude the fact that it is focused. The funniest thing, however, is that on the one hand the union provides an excuse for the removal of this flyer, saying that the press release on the noticeboard had a ""natural course of publication"" and the natural course is that they published it, realized they had made a blunder and deleted it. That was the natural course, so this thing is dead, but they say that it was a natural course because they organized it, but they recall, regarding the possibility of publishing these documents on the union noticeboard, Article 1 of Law No. 300 of May 20, 1970, otherwise known as the Workers' Statute - still in force, we understand - which establishes the freedom of expression of thought in compliance with constitutional principles. Basically they claim the right to publish whatever the hell they want. In reality, in the citation of this article of the Workers' Statute there is a piece missing, because it is actually written in Article 1 that ""Workers, without distinction of political opinion, union membership and religious faith, have the right, in the places where they carry out their work, to freely express their thoughts in compliance with the principles of the Constitution"", but then there is another little piece: ""... and the rules of this law"". Because the Workers' Statute also provides a series of rules. What do the provisions of this law say about the ability to publish something on the union noticeboard? In Article 25 of the same law we find the right to post, which says: ""The company union representatives have the right to post on specific spaces, which the employer is obliged to prepare in places accessible to all workers within the production unit, publications, texts and communications relating to matters of union and labor interest"", not the entire world, human knowledge, the shopping list, grandma's photographs: texts and communications relating to matters of union and labor interest. Let's start by saying that I am not a public or regional employee, and yet I have access to everything that has been published because the regional employees - there are usually some who are not left-wing, or are not unionists - are particularly annoyed by the continuous publication of these things, so they rightly give us the right information, and it must be said that we can actually say anything, but we cannot say that a press release sent to respond to the undersigned is a matter of union and labor interest. Mine is a political inspection initiative, a union's response is absolutely legitimate if sent to the newspapers, but putting it on the employees' intranet noticeboard... objectively does not deal with any union or labor matter. In addition to this, however, imagine the further dismay when, again the same unions - not the least bit affected by the fact that perhaps that tool is not the most suitable for addressing a certain type of issue - think of publishing this nice flyer against the ""Security"" bill, to announce a nice demonstration. In this flyer, the signatures appear again, in addition to some unions, also of the National Partisans Association - okay, I look at my colleague Guichardaz, who just passed by - of the Italian Communist Party, of Communist Refoundation, of Valle d'Aosta Open - regarding my colleague Guichardaz, who is marching behind us - and another acronym that is too small to identify, but I imagine that it tends to be more or less of the same type. It is always red, it has red and white writing, maybe I will ask my colleague to interpret them. I see this objectively as a sense of impunity, indeed, almost of contempt, of mockery, with respect to the rules that they themselves, that the unions themselves cite in their press release, made to respond to the undersigned - I repeat: you are completely free to do so, it does not concern me in the least - who however does not respect the provisions that the law provides. I believe that someone, perhaps convinced that what is done with certain political activities, that is, cloaking a political action with ""apoliticization"", ""non-partisanship"", associationism - because that's what it is: a political action - has thought that one can be clever by publishing one's political communications on the employees' noticeboard. I'll add one more chapter. If the noticeboard were something that could be consulted specifically, that is, I go in and I don't see anything, if I don't go specifically to look at the union noticeboard, it wouldn't be good anyway, but it would be less serious all in all; but the problem is that this noticeboard appears precisely when you enter your intranet, the employee's, it's the first thing that appears. If I want to go and see something, I am inevitably attracted by this. That's why with this interpellation, Mr President, I ask you if you intend to prepare a regulation to govern the publication of communications on the employees' intranet noticeboard, in compliance with what I mentioned to you, namely Article 25 of Law No. 300 of 20 May 1970."
47944,XVI,07/11/2024,"AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE, Ordinamento degli uffici e del personale",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,4256,"I'll start with a joke, in the sense that if, after a month, the hopes we had formulated have fallen in vain on both sides, it's not as if there was that much sharing. In short, we are here again to talk about it, it's our job and we do it with the correctness of always. It is also mentioned in the interpellation, I remember what Article 25 of the Workers' Statute says: ""the company union representatives have the right to post on special spaces that the employer is obliged to prepare in places accessible to all workers within the production unit, publications, texts, communications relating to matters of interest to the union and work""; it could probably be considered an excess of democracy, but there are some significant words within this provision, which say ""right to post"" and ""obligation to prepare"". That's the rule. As already stated on the previous occasion, the employer, the Region in this specific case, is obliged to make available a space, which has now become virtual and issues verified access credentials to those who operate on this space, as we had already stated last time. It is not responsible for the published contents, as this is material created and managed by third parties, nor can it unilaterally prevent or remove the published material. The interpellation asks ""If it is intended to prepare a regulation to regulate the publication of communications on this noticeboard"". Having the certainty that the interpellation does not intend ""Discipline"" as a synonym for ""Censor"", because it would not be possible, it is noted in the meantime that a regulation in this area should be agreed with the same trade union organizations. Secondly, some regulations on the subject, available online, have been examined and what appears evident is that they are essentially declarations of principle, which take up the Workers' Statute, collective agreements and framework agreements, always underlining the aspect already mentioned, that is, that the responsibility for the contents lies entirely with the subjects authorised to insert them. More generally, the responsibility is not recalled in relation to the contents of what is published, but with regard to the possible violation of Legislative Decree 82/2005 (i.e. the digital administration code) and Legislative Decree 196/2003 (i.e. the code on personal data protection). The only other significant provisions then concern the prohibition of using the notice board for personal purposes and the setting of time limits, generally between 60 and 90 days, after which the texts must be removed, if they do not remove them first. There is no provision aimed at identifying what is of interest to the union and to work, given that it would all be very questionable and this could be considered an unjustified limitation to the right to post. These, therefore, are the parameters within which any regulation of the use of the union noticeboard on the intranet site of the Region should operate. In any case, I will ask the Department of Personnel to start this discussion with the union organizations, even though I have some doubts that this meets the overall expectations of the interpellation, because it will probably not resolve what is requested. I conclude with two small reflections. The first is that it is possible that, thanks to this interpellation, the union noticeboard on the intranet page of the regional site has had an increase in consultation and will certainly be of interest to the union organizations. The second is that the opportunities to view texts and documents such as the one stigmatized by the interpellation in today's virtual society are now so many and such that it is at least doubtful that the political opinion of regional employees is formed through the intranet noticeboard, which moreover, as you also underlined, for a simple statistical fact, is also accessed by people who do not share what is supported by the flyer, who have a vision opposite to what the flyer itself perhaps wants to convey."
47944,XVI,07/11/2024,"AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE, Ordinamento degli uffici e del personale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,3959,"English: Clearly I want to take the positive side of the answer you gave us, net of the considerations, which is a reflection on the theme of the right to publication. It is a positive side because it certainly opens up a reflection. President, you rightly said, I don't know if ironically or more seriously, that obviously this does not mean censoring anyone's opinion. I would like to claim this, as I have already had the opportunity to say on the occasion of the discussion of the motion of the PCP colleagues: I am a careful defender of Article 21 of our Constitution which, even more than the Workers' Statute, guarantees freedom of expression. As you will remember, however, and as some interventions, always in that discussion, have recalled, also recalled by colleague Perron, what we unfortunately must always keep in mind is what can or cannot be done in public spaces, that is, guaranteed by everyone. No one wants to censor what is published, by one side or the other. English: I am certain, Mr President, that if tomorrow a non-left-wing union were to publish a manifesto, for example, on the demonstration for President Trump's victory yesterday, alerting a demonstration with all the signatures, with the signatures of the center-right parties underneath, some left-wing union would most likely have something to say. I could give all the possible reasons, but it is clear that that would be a classic example of communication that has nothing to do with work. Here we are not discussing whether or not to censor someone, here we are discussing how to use the spaces that belong to everyone. What you said is right, that is, that with social media today communication has multiplied and therefore there is no difficulty in accessing information, this is very true, but precisely for this reason it reinforces our idea that public spaces - we are talking about the union noticeboard, we are talking about public spaces such as for example the Cittadella dei giovani, which has been the scene of some events in recent days - must have a profound respect and profound political secularism within them. No one can use spaces to bend, one way or the other, their own narrative. Everyone has their own channels, everyone has the faculty and the possibility to say what they deem most appropriate, outside of the channels that are paid for with everyone's money, so this faculty must be guaranteed, but it must be limited and a public channel like the one that was exploited must not be exploited. Everything can be said but, I repeat, what has been done is a selection of communications on union matters that I believe can be done trivially starting from a press release. This is a press release that workers are not interested in, on a political inspection initiative. It is a press release that evidently did not have the right to be published. But I do not care whether it was published or not, indeed, if the union in question had made a press release and sent it to the newspapers, I would have displayed it like a medal. Is this far-left union against me? Very well, it means I am in the right direction. Publishing things like this on everyone's union noticeboard, however... evidently it is not a union matter, this must be reiterated. We will therefore wait for the results of this verification, of this in-depth study that you announced to us, and we hope that this can be a way to overcome this distorted use of the tools, which instead should be made available to workers and their representatives for proper reflections on the subject of work and on union matters, which are absolutely necessary, useful and above all that support workers who are not involved in politics."

As we know, a new law has been approved. In this new law there were amendments, including one from our group, which concerned the possibility of accessing the competition, which has been drastically limited by this latest law, because it went from 32 to 26 years, implementing, as we were told, the national legislation. By not implementing the national legislation, however, we remain at 38 years, instead of 37, for what concerns the volunteer Firefighters. We have represented, within the debate on this law, the fact that there was a lack linked precisely to the people who in 2012 could not participate in the competition because they were too young and now will not be able to participate in the competition because they are too old. We also remember the serious statements of the President, for which we are still waiting for clarification, or at least a public apology; if he reviewed and re-heard what he said, which could also be a reason for a possible request for an apology today, otherwise we will certainly talk about it in the next Regional Council. In this sense, the President had also pointed out that I had not taken care of doing the counts properly, and I confirm this, because my request for access to the documents arrived after I presented the amendments, so it's not that I didn't take care of doing the counts, but I hadn't been able to take care of doing the counts. Now I have them too. What we are asking for is: to understand the number of registered and eligible candidates for the 2012 Fire Brigade Forestry Corps recruitment competition between the ages of 26 and 29, that is, the age group that would be excluded from this new competition; the reasons why the 38 years were instead maintained, compared to national legislation, because, if the objective is alignment with national legislation, we ask why the 38 years were instead maintained for volunteer personnel; if the regulation is being considered to allow those who were unable to participate in the 2012 competition to be able to participate in the next one."

""The reasons why 38 years was maintained as an entry requirement for volunteer personnel"": given that the difference compared to the state limit was only one year, it was decided to maintain the age limit set by regional law 37/2009, slightly more extensive, to encourage the participation of volunteer firefighters. ""If we are considering changing the rules, in order to allow those who were unable to participate in the 2012 competition to register"". Honestly, it may be our limitation, but it becomes difficult to understand the meaning of this question, considering that the law has just been approved. In any case, the 2012 competition has closed its path, the next competition will have the expected rules, with the participation requirements indicated in the new law."

However, we are talking about 93 people and 12 eligible. Compared to the 64 eligible, we are talking more or less about 53%. We sincerely believe that, from this point of view, an explanation could have been given. In addition, to help you in the answer to the next interpellation, I can tell you that in fact the amendment we had presented was poorly constructed because, as you rightly said, you could participate if you had turned 18 on August 10. By putting the years as we had indicated in that amendment, we would have still excluded a whole part, both from 1994 and from 1998, because in fact, analyzing the documentation that I received, I was able to ascertain that in this sense it could be expanded. I am pleased to hear that the rules, once approved, cannot be changed in these matters. I want to give two examples: we are in 2010, in May 2010 the rules for access to the Forestry Corps staff were voted on, where middle school was foreseen and in July 2010, not even six months passed, this was modified and we went back to middle school. This is a case. Let's go back to a more recent case: the municipal secretaries. Let's go and make an omnibus which, as we said, creates problems and difficulties with respect to recruitment, let's go and look at the budget variation, which we should approve shortly, and there too we modify the rules. When you want, the rules can be modified. The boys who are in the 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 years are 4,000, we are excluding the possibility for 4,000 boys. Of course, not all of them may want to be a firefighter, of course, but of these 4,000 boys maybe a small percentage could be there, we are excluding the possibility for those boys to be able to participate today, after not having been able to participate then; furthermore, not being able to participate in the national competition, because this could be the observation, because here in Valle d'Aosta we still have the middle school diploma, while at the national level there is the lower secondary school. If this is not total discrimination, I wonder what we are talking about."
47946,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,7200,"This interpellation returns to the very important issue of the procedure used for the appointment of the directors and the board of auditors of CVA EOS S.r.l., an issue that we had already raised with a question discussed in the Council on 22 May. On that occasion we had highlighted that in our opinion the provisions of regional law 20/2016 had not been respected in the appointment procedure. Following that discussion, on 31 May the president of CVA had written to the President of the Region, to the President of the Regional Council, to the President of Finaosta and to the undersigned, as proposer of the question, complaining about a distorted interpretation of the regional law. The letter then concluded with a pressing request to the Region and Finaosta to publicly clarify the controversial aspects. To correctly frame the matter, it should be remembered that CVA EOS S.r.l. is a company wholly owned by CVA S.p.a. and that, for the appointments of its administrative and trade union bodies, the same rules provided for CVA S.p.a. must be applied. The regional law, as we have repeatedly highlighted, in fact states that the rules on the procedure for appointments apply to the Compagnia valdostana delle acque and its subsidiaries. Despite this provision of law, the same procedures were not applied in the designations of the administrative bodies of the two companies. For CVA S.p.a., the public evidence procedure was carried out, while for CVA EOS this did not occur. This is not just a formal issue, but a substantial one, because the difference in procedures allowed an abnormal situation to arise. In fact, as emerged in the discussion of the question of 22 May 2024, a managing director was appointed to manage CVA with an all-inclusive annual salary of 50,000 euros, while the same managing director was appointed to manage CVA EOS, recognizing him, I quote from the words of the President of the Region, a compensation of 300,000 euros for each financial year. This is recorded in the documents. I would also add that we received a report according to which in the shareholders' meeting of CVA EOS, last 14 October, it was decided to distribute bonuses to directors and members of the Board of Auditors for approximately 600,000 euros, of which approximately 200,000 would have gone to the managing director. This is something we will verify, then request the minutes. What is currently happening? That a CEO, selected through a public tender that provided for an annual compensation of 50,000 euros all-inclusive, finds himself in 2024 receiving, overall, emoluments that reach approximately 550,000 euros, perhaps even more. It seems to me that there is something anomalous in all this, or in any case not entirely clear. CVA defends and justifies the procedure followed for the appointments of CVA EOS. The president, in the letter of 31 May, considered our statements to be the expression of an interpretative misunderstanding, arguing that PCP had not taken into due consideration what was stated in the guidelines containing the application discipline of law 20/2016, those guidelines approved with resolution of the Board no. 1591 in December 2022. A resolution that in fact, in our opinion, made statements that were inconsistent with the law. In the aforementioned letter from the president of CVA, at a certain point there is also an evident concern about the level of adequacy of the examination of the issue of the appointment procedures by Finaosta and the Region, to the point of hypothesizing, absurdly, an unheard of carelessness on the part of the Region and Finaosta. We do not know whether it was an unheard of carelessness or a choice, however, on our part we can only reiterate what is clearly written in the regional law, as well as underlining that an interpretation given with an incautious resolution of the Council cannot exceed what is established by a law. This is what we thought, however, not having sufficient expertise, we wanted to delve into the matter, acquiring a pro veritate opinion on the subject, which we will make available, which was drafted by Professor Caruso, a university professor of corporate law. What did we ask Professor Caruso? We asked this question: ""With regard to the application of the procedure for the designation of members of the corporate bodies of CVA and its subsidiaries, is there a discrepancy between what is stated in Article 2-bis of Regional Law 20/2016? This is what is stated in the application guidelines of the law, approved with resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022. We therefore ask to know whether the same procedures provided by the regional law for the designations of CVA S.p.a. must be followed for the designations of the corporate bodies of companies established and controlled by CVA"". Professor Caruso's conclusion... There is a detailed opinion, however in essence, at the end of the analysis, what did he tell us? ""The discipline dictated by article 2-bis, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of regional law 20/2016 regarding the appointment of the administrative and control bodies of regionally-owned companies applies to CVA S.p.a. and to the companies controlled by it. Any conflict between the regional law and the implementing guidelines of the same law must be resolved by affirming the prevalence of the legislative discipline"". The issue is very relevant, also because it does not only concern the two companies I mentioned, but also many others, so CVA's concern and the president's request for clarification are understandable. In fact, that letter of 31 May sent to the regional authorities and to Finaosta ended by asking for a public response to the questions raised. In conclusion, the interpellation poses two questions to the President of the Region: ""Whether the Region and Finaosta have responded to the letter of 31 May signed by the president of CVA and to his pressing request for clarification"" and ""What do you intend to do to promptly apply what is provided for by the regional law on the appointment of the administrative and control bodies of CVA S.p.a. and its subsidiaries. I would add that after the presentation of the interpellation, filed on October 25, we learned - by reading the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting of CVA S.p.a., obtained through access to the documents - that Finaosta, in the person of the then president Nicola Rosset, actually sent a response on July 5, 2024. We do not know what was responded to, we asked for a copy on October 28, the canonical days for urgency have passed but we have not received it. Surely, however, the President of the Region can report on its content, because Finaosta responded. As we do not know, just as we do not know if the Region also responded. Obviously then there is also the second question, on which we await answers."
47946,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,8467,"Before providing answers to the questions posed, I would like to underline that multiple clarifications have already been made on the issue over the last two years, specifically with regard to the regional designation discipline of regional representatives on the objective scope of application of regional legislation. Furthermore, it seems appropriate to dwell on the tone of the initiative, completely disrespectful of the work of the offices of the Presidency, competent on the procedures for the nomination and designation of participating companies. Asking for explanations on the work of the offices is completely legitimate - and on the other hand the council initiatives are aimed at this - it is another thing, however, to attack the offices by stigmatizing, in the absence of any contradictory discussion, their unheard of carelessness or, even - a much more serious statement, because it presupposes voluntary and conscious behavior - the considered choice not to respect the regulatory provision. All this on the basis of the conclusions submitted by an external consultant, in an opinion given to the Councilor, in the light of evidence, in the face of her interpretative doubt on the applicable legislation of which the offices were never informed. Even in the face of this lack of information on a question that must be examined only and exclusively from a legal point of view, without attributing patents of foolishness or bad faith, the accusations made against the offices with the interpellation are therefore extremely unjustified and completely specious. As regards the questions, instead, I provide an analysis developed by the competent offices, which indicate - as the regional law 20/2016 states, in article 1, paragraph 1-bis - that ""the provisions of this law do not apply to the subsidiary Aosta Factor S.p.a., nor to the subsidiary Compagnia valdostana delle acque-Compagnie valdôtaine des eaux S.p.a., and its subsidiaries"", with the exception of article 2-bis, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and article 4 and article 5, paragraph 3, relating to the verification of knowledge of the French language, within the procedures for hiring non-managerial staff of article 6 and article 9. Article 1 therefore delimits the scope of application of regional law 20 with respect to some companies, to which only some of the articles of the same regional law apply; if this is the general rule - referring to the scope of application and to the individual provisions referred to in Article 1, to which reference must be made in order to understand how much and to whom these provisions apply - in the case of the regional designation and nomination procedure the reference is to Article 2-bis of Regional Law No. 20 which, in paragraph 2, establishes that ""Finaosta appoints the members of the administrative and control bodies of companies with indirect participation and held within the scope of the interventions of the special management referred to in Article 6 of Regional Law No. 7 of 16 March 2006"". It is therefore to this provision that we must refer to understand which are the companies with indirect regional participation in which the directors are appointed, following designation by the Regional Council, at the end of the procedure governed by paragraphs 3 to 6 of the same article 2-bis: in this provision, as mentioned, the reference is first of all to the concept of appointment: ""Finaosta S.p.a. appoints the members of the administrative and control bodies"" and another important reference is that ""To the indirect participation and held within the scope of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, no. 7"". The progressive and multi-subject formation procedure (since it also involves the Region), started by Finaosta - in paragraph 3, with the publication of a public notice for the search for candidates that ends with a designation resolution transmitted by the Region to Finaosta S.p.a. for the purposes of appointment - is a procedure referred by law only to companies in which Finaosta is a partner on behalf of the Region and in which, as a partner, it exercises, according to ordinary civil law, the power to appoint directors and other corporate bodies in the Assembly. Following the resolution of designation by the Regional Council, Finaosta then exercises its prerogatives as a partner, ensuring that the designation of the Region effectively translates into the subsequent appointment of the subjects identified by the public body, without prejudice to the fact that (as established in article 2, paragraph 3, of regional law 20/2016 - the current state legislation) the power to formalize said appointment belongs solely and exclusively to the Assembly. What is regulated by Article 2-bis is therefore the designation and nomination procedure in which the subjects involved are respectively and necessarily the Region and Finaosta: the Region, as the body that designates, and Finaosta, as the body that proposes the nomination in the Assembly, but - according to the provisions of the civil code, which cannot be derogated by regional law -, Finaosta can produce the nomination only in the assemblies in which it is entitled to participate, or in those in which it is a member; from this it follows that the designation procedure referred to in Article 2-bis, as also expressly specified in paragraph 2 of the same article, concerns only the procedure in which Finaosta is the owner of shares within the scope of the interventions of the special management referred to in Article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, n. 7. In companies controlled and participated by CVA, in which the shareholding is held by CVA and not by Finaosta, it is CVA that sits in the meetings of its subsidiaries, as a shareholder, to propose and decide on the appointment of directors and other corporate bodies. For these appointments, governed by the ordinary corporate code, therefore the two-phase procedure (regional designation and Finaosta appointment) governed by article 2-bis of regional law 20/2016 does not apply, referring, as mentioned, only to cases in which in the controlled companies the shareholder is Finaosta, therefore CVA S.p.a., of which Finaosta is a shareholder, and not the subsidiaries of the latter, in which Finaosta, not being a shareholder, cannot exercise any power of appointment. Considering this to be the correct reading of the provisions of regional law 20/2016, it is clear that - unlike what was stated in the part of the opinion reported in the interpellation - there is no conflict between the regional law and the implementing resolution, which correctly and in application of the legislative provision states that regional law 14 November 2016, no. 20, applies to the companies Aosta Factor S.p.a. and Compagnia valdostana delle acque S.p.a. and its subsidiaries, exclusively with regard to the procedure for appointing regional representatives within the companies in which they are indirectly involved, through Finaosta S.p.a.. I specify, in this regard, that pursuant to the combined provisions of article 2-bis of regional law no. 20, which makes explicit reference to the role of Finaosta S.p.a., as owner of the shareholdings within the scope of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of regional law 16 March 2006, no. 7, with the article 1 in comment, the designation procedure referred to in article 2-bis does not apply to Aosta Factor S.p.a., since the shareholding is held exclusively within the ordinary management referred to in article 5 of regional law 7/2006, and for shareholdings in companies directly controlled by CVA. It is therefore up to Finaosta S.p.a. and CVA S.p.a. - as direct shareholders respectively of Aosta Factor S.p.a. and of the companies controlled by CVA itself - to propose the appointment of the members of the corporate bodies in the said companies. With the above and thanking the offices for the work they have provided, I hope to have clarified the doubts expressed and I reiterate that it is one thing to express and want to deepen interpretative doubts with the help of external opinions and consultancy, it is another to accuse the offices of ignorance or bad faith, whose task, instead, is precisely that of ensuring compliance with the law and the correctness of administrative action."
47946,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,6,3243,"I want to immediately clear the field of a possible misunderstanding, because we do not accuse the offices of inadequacy. The sentence that was reported, which I also explained in the illustration of the interpellation, is a sentence that President Cantamessa used in the letter he wrote to you, to me, to President Bertin and to the President of Finaosta on May 31, in which he says that, if the interpretation were correct - and we believe it could be correct -, this would imply an unheard of carelessness on the part of the offices of the Region and the offices of Finaosta. We do not accuse anyone, if anything it is someone else who has raised this issue. I must say that it is very interesting to read the minutes, which we acquired with access to the documents, and the positions that emerge from Finaosta and from CVA. It is interesting because I believe that, on that occasion, the representative of Finaosta tried to understand a little better how this issue worked and perhaps even created some annoyance in the people who were listening to him, given the report of that minute which, clearly, being a fairly aseptic report, I believe was also made a little softer than I imagine was discussed. On the rest, President, given that you have reeled off a legal treaty, or an opinion, I ask you to be kind enough to receive a written copy of the response, because evidently I am not able to remember, article by article, what is in the provisions of the law, and I am referring to 20/2016 as well as to the resolution relating to the guidelines. I note, however, that you have not answered the first of my questions, that is, you have not told me whether the Region and Finaosta - and I know about Finaosta because I have read the minutes and I know that on 5 July President Rosset wrote to CVA - you have not told me whether the Region responded to that letter. For the skills that I may have, but precisely because then, being very scarce, I asked for a consultancy, I made my answer when I received the material, when I had the opportunity to understand a little better, and this opinion that we have acquired obviously we will make it available to everyone, also because these are consultancy assignments that are provided thanks to the possibility of having contributions to the groups, therefore they are public money that is spent, as far as we are concerned, also to provide materials that are useful to us, but could also be useful to others. However, I ask you, President, to provide me with the answer so that I can fully analyze what you told me. As regards, instead, the opinion that we have acquired and that essentially confirms the prevalence of the law over a resolution of the Board, which also cites guidelines, I must say that the law - you said it at the beginning of your explanation - excludes Aosta Factor and CVA and its subsidiaries from a whole series of obligations, but not those that concern article 2-bis, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the regional law, for which the issue of appointments and transparency of appointments is contained in this article and in these paragraphs. I thank you, if you can give me the answer."

47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,2,2629,"With the month of September this year, the new university center of the University of the Aosta Valley was inaugurated, with a location in the center, performing for the students of the Aosta Valley. There are about a thousand students who attend the university and we all know how chronic the lack of parking spaces is in the city of Aosta, especially in that area. For the kids who attend university in the Aosta Valley it is a significant problem, because it is difficult to use public transportation. At the moment there is no train that works, the morphology of our territory, the side valleys, those who come from outside Aosta... these are all situations that cause difficulty and therefore almost force the kids to arrive in Aosta with their own means, with a car. It is also necessary to take into account the fact that many of these kids also work, do odd jobs and also have commitments to take care of elderly people in the family, so it is also difficult to spend the day at the university and then still have to try to reconcile the use of public transportation with timetables and connections. There is no doubt that we often talk in this Council about promoting study, about promoting the school path of the kids, to increase their skills and level of education. This is a priority that we have looking to the future, so that the kids can then design a life path that is rewarding compared to expectations. At this time, in which there are not even available parking spaces inside the building, these kids obviously park in the spaces that are in the area, which are all in blue zones, so they also spend a lot of money on parking to be able to get to Aosta and attend university. For this reason we proposed this initiative aimed at trying to find a solution, because either you make available and give the possibility of having sustainable parking for this category, which is a fragile category, which often does not produce... clearly we cannot affect the Municipality of Aosta, which is the manager of the spaces, and therefore if we wanted to go in that direction the Region would have to make resources available to the Municipality of Aosta to cover the lost income; otherwise we should find solutions, such as having parking outside and having shuttles that quickly connect the parking lot with the university, because this is an additional load that means, in concrete terms, a few hundred cars arriving in that area every day."
47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,4086,"Thank you, colleague, for raising the issue of parking for university use. As you pointed out, the project of the University of Valle d'Aosta has provided over 100 spaces for staff and students, which, as you know, was not foreseen for the university when it was located in the old building; and, as you know, until last year students organized themselves differently: either with public transport or parking elsewhere. Today the parking lot, which is an attraction, as you point out, a sort of extra asset, is being completed. For the shortest possible route we have contacted SIV, the company in charge of the construction of the new building, which has confirmed that the work will be completed by the current month of November. This is to reassure and comfort both you and those listening to us. It will soon be possible to use it, I imagine in ways regulated by the university itself, given that the university has about a thousand students enrolled. The university will have to somehow make a regulation for its use. However, I would like to point out, in any case and also for the benefit of the people who are listening to us, that the regional administration, through the structures headed by my colleague Bertschy, has established a series of fare concessions for public transport for university students. For residents of the Aosta Valley, there is a local public transport bus pass that can be used on the entire regional bus network, at a cost of 20 euros per month, with no limitations on daily trips, and a monthly pass with a 60% discount on rail transport, which is currently being carried out via a substitute bus service, with no limitations on daily trips. For non-residents of the Aosta Valley - given that you also mentioned a sort of attraction for students who come from outside - the local public transport bus pass, which can be used on the entire regional bus network, also costs 20 euros per month, with no limitations on daily trips. A season ticket has been created, therefore, that privileges both residents and non-residents, with the possibility of asking the regional administration, for non-residents, for a 60% refund of the cost incurred for the purchase of the monthly rail transport season ticket, now a replacement, on the Aosta-Turin route. This is to say that in any case, even from the point of view of transport, an attempt has been made to address this problem of transport to and from Aosta. I also remember - it can always be useful as a suggestion, also with a view to limiting city traffic and the consequent increase in polluting load, because our goal is not to bring cars into the city, but to prevent traffic from increasing in the city - that it is available, I say this also for the benefit of those who listen to us, at more than controlled rates, the season ticket of 15 euros per month for the De la Ville car park in via 1° maggio, which is the former Cogne area, which has 540 spaces, from which you can comfortably reach the university in less than a quarter of an hour. We are talking about young people, people who are not handicapped in any way, so the invitation is also to look ten minutes from the university. For 15 euros a month you can get a pass, without any kind of limitation, reaching the university in ten to fifteen minutes. I conclude my answer by thanking you again for the initiative, I hope the answer has comforted you. The parking lot will also be finished by November and, among other things, this is an initiative that has allowed me to update, in addition to the times for completing the parking lot, also on the many possibilities related to parking. Among other things, near the university there is also a series of free parking lots. I remember the Ferrando area, which is five minutes away. I was therefore also able to inform about public mobility, which I believe has also been organized taking into account the needs of our young people who attend university."
47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,2061,"I listened to your answer, Councilor, we knew that there is a parking lot, under construction, with 111 spaces for the staff, but, once the staff is deducted, the students will have very few and above all not enough compared to the needs. If you have done, or want to do, a survey, it is at least a few hundred parking spaces needed for the kids. I will tell you more: you made a speech entirely focused on the fact that we need to discourage the use of the car to get to the center of Aosta. In terms of principle, it is more than acceptable, but in terms of concreteness I can tell you that if some kids and families choose the car it is probably because there is no alternative to their needs, because using the car costs more than public transport. There is no one who by vocation wastes the financial resources available to them, when more is spent than what most people would think is necessary, it is probably because there is a problem. Then we understand very well and we know that there are concessions for the use of public transport, but here there is also a problem of timetables and attendance at the venue, there is the problem that, to arrive and then to leave, maybe it takes two hours to get home, because there will be one bus per hour; if I finish the lesson as soon as the bus has left, it means that I have to wait an hour for the bus and then travel another hour. If this happens every day, you understand that it is a serious inconvenience. If we have made a report of this type, it means that the problem is felt and I believe that the students themselves will report directly to you - because it has been reported to us - the problem they are experiencing, and then we will see if you can find a solution, because I can actually assure you that these are hundreds of cars that need to find a place to park and that today most of them park in the blue zones, because it is not easy to find parking spaces, spending 8-10 euros a day to solve this problem."
47948,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,(LEGA VDA,2,2361,"This is a question relating to teachers' fixed-term contracts. In April of this year, 7 teachers, hired on a fixed-term contract, working in our schools, obtained from the Aosta labor court the right to recognition of seniority increases and, therefore, the resulting salary treatments. Specifically, the autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta - it seems, at least, from the news we have had from the press, etc. - was ordered to recognize these teachers, as salary differences, an amount of around 45,000 euros. It is clear that other lawsuits could probably come, in relation to this issue which, as we recall, is quite similar to that of the teacher bonuses of some time ago, which was then resolved, in addition to disbursements of legal fees and compensation, also with specific measures that had to be taken to remedy this problem that was spreading. We also recall that the European Commission has referred Italy to the EU Court of Justice for the abusive use of fixed-term contracts and discriminatory working conditions in schools. According to the European Commission, in fact, Italian legislation discriminates between teachers in public schools with fixed-term contracts and those hired on a permanent basis, because it does not provide for the former a salary progression based on previous periods of service. This may also be questionable from a legal point of view, but that is how it is. Having recalled Article 2, first paragraph, letter a), of the Statute of Autonomy, according to which the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, in fact, has primary legislative competence with regard to the legal-economic status of personnel, we ask the government to know this: ""Whether the regional administration has taken note of the aforementioned referral order from the EU Court of Justice"" - I think so -, ""Whether estimates have been made on what the financial consequences for the regional administration could be as a consequence of the aforementioned orientations of the national and European Union jurisdictional bodies"" and ""Whether it is the intention of the regional government to prevent further future disputes and, if so, through what specific actions""."
47948,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,6104,"Since these are very technical issues, which you are certainly more familiar with than I am, I had the offices write a contribution for me, which in any case also liaised with the Legal Office. I will not answer you politically and then at the end I will make a very small digression, not even political, but of a trade union nature, if you like. Yes, I am aware of the decision of the European Commission that referred Italy. You ask me if the administration is aware of it. Yes, the European Court of Justice, so that the conditions for appeals to fixed-term contracts are reduced, so that precarious teachers have the same seniority increases as tenured teachers... and this in the name of full equalisation of rights. You mentioned, among other things, the issue of the teacher bonus, there we were able to operate at a local level through the tools that are granted to us, precisely because we believe, among other things, in the equalisation of rights of people who do the same things. I would add that, in order to find a concrete solution to this complex issue, which has long been one of the major problems of the Italian school system - and we know it -, national legislative intervention is needed, because Italian legislation, which determines the remuneration of teachers on fixed-term contracts in public schools, does not provide for an incremental salary progression based on previous periods of service. It should be remembered, in fact, that Presidential Decree no. 861/1975, which is the implementing regulation of the Statute, provides that the rules in force for the corresponding staff of institutes and schools operating in the rest of the State apply to the managerial and teaching staff belonging to the roles of the Valle d'Aosta Region, with regard to their legal status and economic and career treatment,. You know this, having also held the role of Councillor for Education for a certain time. We are bound, with regard to legal status and economic and career treatment, by national rules and the national contract. Question two, ""Have any estimates been made and what the consequences might be, etc."": it's impossible, the offices tell me - but it's a topic we debate daily, because I don't like to see, obviously, the Region losing in the appeals, just as I don't like to see serial appeals, which in the end bring money to the lawyers and this is obviously public money - but I told you that it's impossible to make any estimates. English: The group of potential beneficiaries is represented by substitutes who have exceeded 36 months of service with fixed-term contracts, but it is not possible to quantify their number, because the number of those who will continue to work in the school cannot be predicted, especially because there is no predetermined need plan for substitutes for the school sector, as fixed-term contracts are defined both during the adjustment phase of the legal staff to the factual situation, and following various contractual events of tenured teachers, such as part-time, mobility or other types of leave, and throughout the school year to cover illnesses, pregnancies, leaves and expectations. We have also discussed this and there is a risk of uncertainty with respect to even the possibility of making estimates that are minimally reliable, precisely because there are so many hours and situations that occur annually, both during the redefinition phase of the staff, after the legal staff, and during the use of leave and all the types of contracts to which teachers are entitled. English: You then ask me ""Whether the government intends to prevent further future disputes and, if so, through what specifications"". If it were possible, I can assure you that no one would want to deal with disputes on a daily basis which, moreover, always lead to politically not so positive situations. As I said before, where we were able to intervene - the issue of the teacher bonus, for example, is one of these, as well as now, for example, in the definition of the supplementary contract on study permits - we have tried to intervene at the level of supplementary bargaining. In response, I will read you what the offices wrote to me: ""It should be noted that, starting from the last PNRR 2023 competition, the logic has been to progressively reduce precariousness, with the provision of a 30% reserve of places for precarious teachers with at least three years of service, even non-continuous, in the previous 5 years"". A legislative maneuver has been made which in my opinion was also interesting. With this measure provided for in the national announcement, our Superintendency has provided in the regional announcement of the aforementioned ordinary competition 2023, referred to in the decree of the President of the Region n. 12 of 15 January 2024, to include in the regional rankings all suitable candidates, and not just the winners, thus allowing, at the time of the placements in roles for the 2024-2025 school year, to scroll through these rankings and hire more teachers than the number of positions originally advertised. It is recalled, in fact, that in August the Superintendency of Studies ordered the hiring of 86 new teachers compared to 36 last year. As already mentioned, however, it will be at the national level that it will be necessary to prepare the necessary rules to reduce the use of a succession of fixed-term contracts in the school sector, so we await action at the national level so that this phenomenon, which you have reported as a non-positive phenomenon, can be somehow contained. I continue to assure you that, since meetings with trade unions are very frequent, we are working to try to fix, where possible, the precarious situations and the situations that have negative repercussions on employees who have been working for the school system for some time now."
47948,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,2970,"I understand very well, of course, that precariousness in schools is a bit like squaring the circle, because it becomes extremely difficult, for objective reasons at times, because the need is almost impossible to determine with certainty, while on the other hand we have this cancer of precariousness that sometimes goes on for years, in a way that is also illegitimate from a constitutional point of view, as a right of people to work and to have job security, precisely. This is a really heavy Achilles heel for our society. I understand, therefore, how there is the will to resolve this issue and that these are issues that also fall on us from above, that we cannot then manage ourselves. Precariousness has been around for too many years, it is too widespread, and I say this on behalf of a party in which Senator Pittoni in particular has been very committed to this area. I believe, however, that something can be done, indeed, a lot. Then, clearly, the sentences arrive in which they tell you that precarious employment is illegitimate and you also have to foresee career progression, which seems a bit paradoxical, for someone who works on a fixed-term basis, but in fact it is a problem of a contradiction in terms that becomes difficult to resolve. What would be appropriate, perhaps, but I'm throwing it out there just as a suggestion, because it really is difficult and I understand very well what a muddy situation this sector is... you told me that you have continuous dialogues with the unions, so try to maintain a continuous dialogue, of course, it's not just the unions that send people to lawyers, of course, I find myself in a sort of vague conflict of interest, because it's true that we all want to avoid spending useless money on causes that are now a given, like those of the teacher bonus, when there are such determined precedents it's now useless, you're almost forced to suffer causes that you already know you'll lose, so it's a truly paradoxical thing, but perhaps in that perspective, sensitize the unions, who are the only interlocutors... you can't go and take them one by one and perhaps it's even difficult to identify the teachers who might have these characteristics; sensitize the unions, try to obtain at least a sort of moratorium in saying that, when, as we are already doing, we implement policies of greater hiring, hopefully with effective national legislative interventions, there will probably be a way to conciliate, or at least prevent the lawsuits in the sense of saying that, once there is a slightly more precise legislative and regulatory panorama, to those who have accrued those rights we will say: ""Don't sue us, we will decide how much we owe you"", which is always the best conciliatory solution when you know you are indebted to someone, even if, as in this case, through no fault of your own."

Precisely in relation to this event, on 2 September 2024 the Regional Council approved resolution no. 1042 with the following subject: ""Approval pursuant to regional law 17/2016 of the participation of the Region in the G7 Agriculture and Fisheries agri-food expo, scheduled in Syracuse from 21 to 29 September"", for which 25,000 euros had been allocated. Recall the ANSA news reported on September 27, 2024, where it is reported that the councilor Carrel at the Ortigia Expo declared: ""The management of the wolf is urgent, it is necessary to commit to the defense of mountain territories""; taking into account that in the Regional Economic and Financial Document 2025-2027, which was approved by the Regional Council last session, within section 3, in the part of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the following is reported: ""Among the constant objectives of the work of the Department, support for the activity of valorization and promotion of territorial excellence, of the food and wine products of the rural territory and of the savoir faire and its operators remains a fixed point. The Department will directly organize initiatives aimed at promoting the image of the Aosta Valley and the marketing of its products through measures and calls for tenders and will support those organized by other entities"". The competent Councillor is therefore asked to know whether, in the discussion held in Ortigia on the future of agriculture and fishing with Italian and European institutions, in his speech he also represented the regional fishing sector, its problems and the related potential for our region; whether initiatives have been undertaken in synergy with the Department of Tourism to best represent, promote and enhance the image of the Aosta Valley during this important Expo agriculture and fishing event; with what methods and strategies it is intended to best promote and enhance a unique image of the Aosta Valley."
47949,XVI,07/11/2024,TURISMO E INDUSTRIA ALBERGHIERA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992.0,M,PA,4,1725,"The G7 Agriculture and Fisheries, which was held from 21 to 29 September 2024 in Ortigia, saw the involvement of all the Italian Regions. The event represented, for the Aosta Valley, an opportunity of primary and absolute importance, in order to enhance the agri-food excellence of our territory. The Agriculture Department of our region, supported by the staff of the Promotion Office, guided the guests of the event on various tasting itineraries of the regional DOP products, accompanied by information about the production peculiarities of mountain agriculture and viticulture, by brochures for the discovery of typical Aosta Valley products and by promotional videos and films relating to our territory, selected specifically for the event. As part of this event I wanted to draw attention to the complex realities of our mountain territories, as well as to the issues relating to fishing and the problems also linked to climate change, which will inevitably lead to having to increasingly protect fish reserves and native species. I also reiterated the need to develop and implement strategies to streamline the timeframes for the new programming of the CSR or PSR. Discussion and dialogue, especially on these occasions, on issues of common importance, are essential to develop and implement strategies that are as effective as possible. I believe, colleague, that you will agree with me on the importance of telling, promoting and valorising a food, a product, in a sustainable way, and of bringing the farmer, the breeder and the fisherman, who play a primary role as custodians of our territory, back to the centre."
47949,XVI,07/11/2024,TURISMO E INDUSTRIA ALBERGHIERA,en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,3630,"English: We have returned to this theme several times, also through this initiative, precisely because we are certain that, even by addressing it several times, sometimes even seeming repetitive on certain topics, all together we can improve certain things and try, above all, to promote and enhance our region as best as possible. This was a good opportunity. We are pleased to have heard from the Councilor who exposed, during this conference, this comparison, also the critical issues related to fishing. Perhaps we expected in his response to understand the point of view of other Regions, on which path we are going in this regard and if there is good news for the entire world of fishing at the Aosta Valley level. As was reported in the article that we cited in the introduction, obviously there are no doubts about the issues related to the management of the wolf, the issue of the wine sector and the issue of the enhancement of the food and wine sector, of the products, of our excellences, we are the first to share all these aspects. As you told me, starting from your response, there were all the Italian Regions present at this meeting, so it was a great opportunity, a great event. It is precisely for this reason that we are increasingly convinced that these must be occasions to make the most of the opportunities that are given to the Valle d'Aosta Region to showcase its excellence but, above all, as we often say, to reiterate and best convey the image of our Region, of its brand, of this Valle d'Aosta brand, ""heart logo, Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"", because these are the occasions where there are so many tourists, people, spectators who pass by these events, that getting to best promote, as we said, our region from all points of view, not just agriculture, in our opinion is increasingly appropriate to try to also meet the needs of other realities and our competitors. We also want to make reference to the fact that we have cited in the premises what is written in the DEFR regarding agriculture; as for the Department of Tourism, instead, the DEFR states that, in terms of promotional and advertising action, we will continue with the adoption of various initiatives aimed at increasing the reputation of the brand, both on national and international markets. This was a passage that we wanted to say precisely to reiterate the need to create more and more synergy between the various Departments, because I believe that we are all convinced that - when there are events or occasions to showcase excellence from a tourist, sports, cultural or food and wine point of view - all this is tourism. We think the presence and dissemination of this brand (which was recently registered, but is strategic for our entire region) is increasingly fundamental. I conclude by saying that this initiative wanted to understand, especially from a political point of view, if there is the intention and the conviction to convey in a synergic way, from now on, this important brand ""Cuore Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"", a unique image that characterizes, promotes and enhances in a transversal way the different Departments of our Region. I believe that this is the path to follow. It is not easy, but only in this way can we still grow from a tourist and promotional point of view and bring an image of the Aosta Valley increasingly important at a national level, but above all at an international level. From 12:04, Vice President Marguerettaz takes over the Presidency."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,5261,"We have already addressed this issue in the last Council because, in fact, it had been brought to the agenda by colleague Minelli on the DEFR, but perhaps a little more in-depth analysis is necessary, because, in fact, we learned from her hearing in the Commission and from the coordinator - and subsequently she also explained it during the discussion of the agenda - that the Monte Rosa and Cervino companies have moved in the assignment process of the so-called DOCFAP, the Feasibility Document of the Project Alternatives, based on Legislative Decree 36/2023. At the time, when she mentioned this legislative decree, apart from those who are technicians... for us it was absolutely not easy to do an immediate in-depth analysis, because in fact the DOCFAP is regulated in Annex 1.7 of the legislative decree, which is quite substantial. What is the point? The new procurement code has modified the design discipline, providing for two design levels and including, among other things, the Feasibility Document of Design Alternatives, which must be drawn up in compliance with the contents of the requirements framework and is a precursor to the drafting of the Design Direction Document, the so-called DIP. DIP which indicates, in relation to the size, specific typology and category of the intervention to be carried out, the characteristics, requirements and design documents necessary for the definition of each design level. With this DOCFAP, therefore, the first step has been established to begin the design of the work, without the Council having said anything about the study. The same companies in the hearing - I will not report the minutes, because I have not yet understood whether it can be done or not, theoretically not - had however established the fact that the study would then give us Councillors the tools to give the same companies the mandate to proceed with an executive and definitive design. Instead, with this document the study would already be overcome, without us having expressed ourselves, to evaluate the best alternative among those proposed and to begin the design of the work. But it does not seem to me that, precisely, these were the agreements. We are certainly not technicians, but at least to examine the issue in depth, especially the economic-financial one, I believe is absolutely essential, given that the companies have even asked for 100% regional financing. It is fine that they are participated, so the money, on one side or the other, is always public money in some way, however - since the financing requested is a special law that, as for the Skyway, finances 100% - rightly a whole series of considerations must be made. Councilor, you know very well that from our point of view we are absolutely not against the project, on the contrary, but we know that it is a project of truly great importance and therefore certainly all the necessary investigations must be done, as was in fact said. Surely then you will reply that in reality this step forward was traced by the previous DEFRs, precisely in relation to the technical-economic feasibility, but the Council, at least from this side, had a totally marginal role. We have already spoken about it: that there is the political will on the part of the majority to carry forward this project is beyond any doubt, no one questions it at all, on the contrary; however, precisely because it was established that it was the Council that had to contribute and participate in the analysis, in the study and then in any case also in the evaluation of the technical-economic feasibility of the work, I believe this process must be carried forward. I truly hope that there was some sort of misunderstanding between you and the President of the Commission, because in fact it seems that perhaps... but you rightly did not participate in the hearings, so you cannot know what was said and what was not, but perhaps you could have believed that after that hearing we could move forward without any kind of problem and that the analysis of the study was finished, which in reality is absolutely not true. This initiative is precisely to clarify and we want to at least reiterate whether there is the intention to have the Regional Council express its opinion on this study and on the alternatives proposed in it: first of all, we are not technicians, so we cannot say whether alternative 1 or alternative 3 is right, because we certainly do not have the skills, at least not on a personal level, to say which is the best thing, but to delve into the matter, given that it is a very substantial study, absolutely yes. ""What is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the assignment of the DOCFAP, in this case ousting the Regional Council, when it was said that the study was preparatory to the DOCFAP"": if we have not given any kind of opinion on the study, I do not understand why we are already moving forward in this direction. Furthermore, ""Whose decision was it"" - whether it was yours, Councilor, or the companies' - ""To proceed with the next assignment of the Feasibility Document of the project alternatives without even communicating it to the Regional Council, if not when the process has already started""."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,4,4884,"Thank you, colleague Lavy, also for how you have illustrated the initiative. The topic is probably a topic of great importance and it may also be that, with respect to the terminology at a technical level, there may sometimes be misunderstandings, or even incorrect communication on my part, as on the part of the coordinator, as happened during the hearing. I clarified this during the discussion of the last Council. I come to the answers and then I also try to make two political considerations. On the part of the majority, to come to the first question, ""Whether there is the intention to have the Regional Council express its opinion on the study and on the alternatives proposed in it"", I would not answer this question exactly. Whether there is the political will to continue to discuss it in the Commission and in the Council: yes. I believe that it is necessary, as the President of the Commission also said when speaking on the last occasion: to have a meeting, perhaps a smaller one, to understand what the opposition is asking for in order to do this in-depth work and what we can give, as a political role, to the bodies we have. She said it and I repeat it: on a technical level it would be wrong to replace one another, also because, beyond the competences, there is also a question of responsibility for the procedures envisaged. The majority has no intention of not working openly on this project, we have been doing so since 2020, from the first DEFR, and we have done so subsequently. The DEFR indicate the paths, but these absolutely do not preclude discussion. We need to understand, once and for all - but I am also available for a meeting with the Commissions or with the group leaders, with whoever you want - understand what is meant by expression of the Council, so we go into detail. Several colleagues have requested it, colleague Minelli requested it and colleague Aggravi requested it: let's decide what role we want to give in this phase and let's do it. Of course we didn't want to collaborate on projects of such wide scope and interest. We are very convinced that the operation can go ahead, we have said so; this is also supported by a whole series of expressions from the structures of the regional administration. The Lega group was already saying it then, as I had the opportunity to say during the last discussion in the chamber: even the Lega group, when we made this choice on the DEFR 2022, had considered it a step that was too restrained, so let's welcome the in-depth analysis. I repeat: let's see what is required, whether a further hearing in the Commission on that document, or something else. At point 2, ""What is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the assignment of the Feasibility Document of the project alternatives of the work, ousting the Regional Council, when their leaders have repeatedly stressed that it would be the Regional Council that would decide what should be done"". On this, the question was probably asked following the hearing. In the last Council I said that it is not a new document, the document is the initial one, the one of the assignment of the project, which the companies have considered, pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023, Article 41, Annex 1.7 - more than the companies, the professionals who analyzed the study for the company - that it could be a DOCFAP still to be completed, so there was no indication to move forward, rather than give that project the value of DOCFAP. To date it has not yet been approved and the companies, to approve it, obviously also ask the regional administration for clarity on the next steps and the activation of a specific program agreement. This is why in the DEFR of last year and this year we said that it is necessary to start the authorization process, so as to then be able to have the structures express themselves on the entire procedure if necessary. Question 3 is now outdated, in the sense that there has been no indication to move forward, but rather now it is also the companies that are asking the political side - the Council, the Executive, the majority - how to proceed, because a series of elements are missing, in particular, as was said last time, it would be necessary to proceed with the SEA and the VINCA. In order to move forward, in fact, a process must be regulated at an administrative level, which could be regulated through a program agreement. I repeat that there have perhaps been moments in which we have not been sufficiently clear, I say this also because there have been discussions with colleague Minelli several times in this chamber. It is necessary to understand what role the Council must assume, if it is the Council, or the Commission, if it is the Commission, with respect to the documents that we have in our hands today. We will certainly not be the ones to preclude a discussion on the subject."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,1858,"I am satisfied, I also appreciated the tone with which you said that there is maximum availability. It is true, the question mark was somehow understanding how to work, because it has always been said that the Council has a central role, but it has not been defined how and what it means that the Council has a central role. We should have a meeting between group leaders to decide the next steps to take forward. I think it is absolutely correct and something truthful that there is the will, I think on everyone's part, to discuss this issue. As for the answer to the second question, I understood that you, in fact, have nothing to do with it and I didn't have many doubts about this. In some way, the attitude of the companies leaves me with some question marks, because, perhaps not having had any kind of response from the political side, to understand how the analysis of this study would have progressed, perhaps a phone call to someone on the Council, perhaps not to you, but to the President of the Commission, to understand if the analysis of the study in the Commission would have progressed, perhaps it should have been done. Because, as I said before, the DOCFAP is a preliminary document for the design and it had been reiterated several times that the study was useful to us to then give directions for the design, to carry out these procedures, which was not done. We know very well that, when it comes to certain topics, some doubts arise. I am not talking about you, Councilor, I am talking at the company level, because several times we see certain attitudes that create many questions, to say the least. I therefore appreciate your spirit, I appreciate the fact that in any case it is also up to us, as Councilors, to see each other and decide what we want to summarize this centrality of the Council, so we will certainly update each other."
47952,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,2423,"Thank you, Mr President, for the prompt passion with which you give me the floor. We always come to the topic of transport and buses. We are talking about the experimental on-demand public transport service for the connection with the international airport of Milan Malpensa. Highlighted that this line, which was in service from 5 July to 9 September 2024, was operational on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; recalled that - this is data from 2016, if I made a mistake in the request the Councillor will correct me, it is data that I found in the Sole 24 Ore - following the acquisition of 100% of Savda by the Arriva Italia group, public road traffic in the Aosta Valley is managed 50% by this company; considering that, looking on the site, the line is currently temporarily suspended and postponed to the next reactivation in December 2024; let's ask three very specific questions. The first: ""What were the results of this experiment during the summer months, whether there was satisfaction"", obviously they pointed out to us the fact that those who have to take the bus to go to Malpensa would have needed this bus even on more days, this is a bit of the rationale of the question, but you will give us information on this; ""What reasons determined the specific limit of days of operation during the period carried out""; ""What intentions does the regional administration have"", so perhaps information is given outside a little earlier than it will happen on the company website, to allow people to know which and when other buses of this type will be there; ""When will the service be reactivated and the possible limitation of operating days in the winter tourist period"". These are the questions. By the way, since we are talking about electric mobility - this is not addressed to anyone in particular, but I stick to the topic perfectly, so as not to incur the reference to the topic that is present in the regulation - Norway is one of the main international producers of oil and one of the first exporters of natural gas in the world, so, even if it had all electric cars, clearly Norway does its own calculations and sells oil and natural gas to the whole world. Then at home it has electric cars and many praise the case of Norway. Brilliant. Let's get to our buses. Thank you, Councilor."
47952,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,4,3917,"Returning to the Aosta Valley, to our buses and the connections with Malpensa, which are also smaller, lighter means of transport, as a connection; ""What were the results of this experiment during the summer months"": precisely because we are talking about experimentation, the connection was introduced in the past for the winter period and we decided to try to experiment it also in the summer periods. Exactly 839 people were transported between July and September. There is also the distributed timetable, where there was greater use. We also tried to introduce a night timetable, to try to connect to international connections that leave at other times. The experimentation is a positive experimentation. Probably the service - in fact we also spoke about it with Councillor Grosjacques, with the Office - should be advertised even more, information should be given both to the local population, but above all to tourists, that this possibility exists and exists in this experimental form. The objective is clear and should be to achieve... and I'm already coming to the second question: ""What reasons determined the specific limit of days of operation during the period carried out"": precisely because it is an experiment, we have tried to give this experiment a first part of organization linked to the periods of greater travel, in particular for the moments of arrival and departure of people. The ideal would be to be able to extend it, indeed, to have it completely at service throughout the week. It is also a question of cost evaluation, we must understand if, by implementing the service, the greater use can make the expense appropriate or if we then risk not having this optimization. For my part, for our part, there is no limit to reasoning in this sense. It is always a question of using resources in the best possible way and trying to do it in the best way to also guarantee the economic system, in particular the hotel system, an additional service for its customers. The evaluation was conducted, in fact, together with the carrier and the Hotel Association. This winter we will work to reason about next summer and to evaluate whether the service can be implemented. It seems like a good service to us, the assessment we give is that it is a useful, necessary service - especially given the phase we are experiencing with transport - and that it can give added value to our territory. As regards point 3, ""What intentions does the regional administration have regarding the new activation of the service and the possible limitation of operating days in the winter tourist period"", the service is in operation until 12/31 because the administrative planning could have been done with a commitment up to that date. We will shortly bring the commitment resolutions for the following years to the Council and obviously the service will continue during this winter and also during the next summer, with some changes to the timetable. As I was saying, we have also introduced departures from Aosta at 03:00 in the morning and at 05:30 from Friday to Sunday to Malpensa, because that is the time of arrival of international flights. Some assessments have been made; the service will continue, the goal is to make it grow and advertise it more and also to understand, directly from those who can benefit from it, if other improvements can be made, making it grow and knowing that we must make more resources available. It is a service that also requires payment by people, so it has a cost that, if used well, can be optimized, because, a bit like all transport services, if they bring added value this added value is then distributed throughout the territory and the related industries."

You have rightly made your assessments and the company too, I can simply tell you that - since we had received reports that require implementation, probably with other assessments - if you could extend it to other days it wouldn't hurt and it could be an important service. That's all I can say to you, in the meantime I thank you."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,2,1636,"Let's return to the issue of the roundabout in the ex Fera area in the Municipality of Saint-Vincent. It is a topic we have already discussed on several occasions in this Regional Council, presenting inspection initiatives, most recently that of 17 April 2024. On that occasion, we were informed by the competent Councillor that the executive planning of the initiative was being updated and the necessary programme agreement to be stipulated with Anas was awaited. We have brought the issue back to the agenda today, because we believe it is an extremely dangerous situation. We see widespread attention on the territory, with the construction of roundabouts, but this topic has been discussed for several years, indeed, I could say that it has been more than ten years, and also another initiative, always on the Saint-Vincent ring road, which has not yet been examined, in correspondence with the cemetery area; these are situations in which there is a great need for intervention. We are surprised that nothing has yet been implemented in this area. There have been several inspections in the ex Fera area, even a few hundred meters after the Fera, where there is access to the Champcillien area, we also talked about this, with an extremely dangerous situation. Seven or eight people have already died in road accidents there and the situation is not being addressed. Therefore, with this initiative we want to ask whether the executive planning has finally been completed and whether the program agreement for the financing of the work has been defined."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,4,4272,"Thank you, colleague Marquis, because this initiative allows us to give an update, to take stock after what we said, if I'm not mistaken, in April. Compared to the previous intervention in the spring, we can confirm the amount of funding planned for the state roads of our region, within the new program agreement between the Ministry of Infrastructure and Anas, an agreement that was approved with the Cipes resolution (Inter-ministerial Committee for Economic Planning and Sustainable Development) and was published in the Official Journal on July 10th. The new assignments, as we have already said - they are official - amount to 9 million, which are to be added to the 5 million already assigned in advance with resources from the 2021 and 2022 budget law. Therefore, on the certain basis of the amount of state funding, this administration has held a series of meetings with the technical structures of Anas, and another is scheduled for next week, to start the discussion on the projects to be included in the next update of the program agreement. We can therefore anticipate that, as a regional department, we have asked Anas that the future plan includes the construction of new roundabouts along the state road, more precisely therefore: in the municipality of Pont-Saint-Martin; in the municipality of Châtillon, at the intersection with via Pellissier; in the municipality of Saint-Denis, at the entrance to the regional road to Pontey: we have asked for the subdivision of an important intervention, which included the Pontey roundabout with the hamlet that is found arriving in Châtillon, therefore going to subdivide that intervention, giving priority to the Pontey roundabout; regarding the intervention that gives access to the municipality of Champdepraz, the construction of a roundabout, as already said in a previous question by colleague Brunod, is particularly complicated, but we are thinking about a safety intervention that will improve the current situation; finally in the Municipality of Saint-Vincent, with two requested interventions: the one in the Fera area, which was already partly planned, and the new roundabout at the intersection with the cemetery road, which you rightly mentioned. The second question: the roundabout in the Fera area is considered, both by the regional and municipal administrations, strategic for the industrial area as well as for making the area's traffic safe and could also constitute an improvement in the road infrastructure for the inhabitants and visitors of the neighboring hamlets, coming from the Municipality of Montjovet. Even before the formalization of this agreement, of the new state funding that we mentioned above, the construction of the Fera roundabout had been the subject of discussions with Anas, discussions that had led to the definition of the design process, which was shared with the municipal administration of Saint-Vincent; process started and in the process of being completed. Unlike the other roundabouts mentioned above, in fact, the Fera roundabout had an advanced stage of development, in fact Anas had already acquired part of the design. In this regard, we urged Anas, which informed us that the design update is nearing completion and is expected to be completed by the end of the current year. The works for the construction of the Fera roundabout are included by Anas in the intervention called AO 280, which also includes the roundabouts of Verrayes, in the Champagne area, and Morgex, at the height of the motorway junction. This was included among the adaptation and safety interventions of the 2016-2020 program contract, which was therefore re-proposed in the new 2021-2025 program contract, to cover the additional economic needs compared to the funds previously allocated. We had these 5 million, which were in fact the surplus with the project of these two roundabouts, Verrayes and Morgex, within which Fera had already been inserted. The 5 million did not cover everything, with the new allocation of these 9, which brings the total to 14 million, here is the total coverage of this roundabout, plus those I had mentioned a little while ago."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,1247,"English: Perhaps we are finally getting to the point of realizing the result. Since the executive design is still being updated and since we had already talked about it and I also mentioned earlier that the roundabout in Fera is nearby, near the Champcillien junction, so there are still 200-300 meters of road to go, and you had done the inspection with Anas at the time, which revealed the extreme danger of that situation, where I said before that there have already been numerous deaths; I believe it is worth urging Anas or checking that the remediation and redevelopment of that situation have also been included. Otherwise, it will not be possible to get to grips with different practices, if it is not included in this initiative. I would invite you, Councilor, to check this, because otherwise there are huge risks in that situation, if we cannot reduce the risk that exists today, because it is extremely dangerous. We note with satisfaction that it seems that the work has been financed. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation from now on, to avoid further delays compared to those that have already occurred up to now."

Last year in our country there were approximately 44,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer, with over 35,000 deaths in 2022. During the initiative it was reported that in Italy in the 15-17 age group 30% declared they smoked"", we point out that within the aforementioned article the National Coordination of Teachers of the Human Rights Subject reiterated the urgency of intensifying awareness campaigns on the phenomenon of smoking among adolescents also through the planning of some lessons on the harms of tobacco in the presence of health specialists in the sector; we note that as of today... but today was referring to October 4th because the initiative is obviously an old initiative, which is reported on the official website uslvda.it, there are some pages and sections relating to the prevention of the regional prevention plan that report the wording: ""pages under construction"". We have verified in recent days that the page relating to prevention has been completed, so it is no longer under construction, while, as regards the regional prevention plan section, there is still a section that is under construction; we recall that on December 6, 2021, the regional prevention plan 2021-2025 was approved with Regional Council resolution no. 1654. This plan identifies ten predefined programs and three free regional programs, integrated and transversal, with which it is intended to implement all the macro objectives and all the strategic objectives of the national prevention plan 2020-2025. The competent Councillors are therefore asked to know: what the situation is today in the regional territory compared to what is represented at the national level, how many and which initiatives are promoted by the respective Departments regarding awareness against the harms of smoking in schools and also in general, that is without considering the classic days or anniversaries; if there is an intention to promote and intensify new activities, projects and awareness campaigns against the harms of smoking in the regional territory."
47954,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6058,"Coming to question no. 1: ""how is the situation in the regional territory compared to what is represented at the national level"", we return to a topic that has already been the subject of debate during the Regional Council in July. The data we report are taken from the PASSI 2022-2023 surveillance. In Valle d'Aosta, among adults aged 18-69, 60.6% (Italian data 58.7) of those interviewed are non-smokers, 13.7% (Italian data 16.8) can be classified as ex-smokers, 25.7% (Italian data 24.5) are smokers. Among those interviewed, 24% said they smoked every day. With reference to young people, a 2022 study on health-related behaviors in school-age children photographed and monitored the health of Italian adolescents aged 11, 13 and 15 and, for the first time, also of 17-year-olds. The picture of the schools in the Aosta Valley that emerged is improving as it is characterized by a perception of adequacy of the structures and attention to health promotion activities. As regards smoking, the study shows that the majority of the children interviewed declared that they had never smoked. The percentage of non-smokers decreases with increasing age, going from 99% of eleven-year-olds to 96.6% of thirteen-year-olds up to 89.5 of fifteen-year-olds. The data also tell us that from 2019 to today the habit of smoking has significantly decreased, in fact the percentage of young people in the Aosta Valley who have never smoked has gone from 78.6% in 2018 to 92.2 in 2022. Coming to question no. 2, attention to prevention related to smoking is included in the regional prevention plan, as you mentioned, in particular within the ""Schools that promote health"" program, and identifies some strategic lines of intervention aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles in the school context, including the fight against the consumption of tobacco and nicotine products. In the 2023-2024 school year, with the Coordination of the Superintendence of Studies of colleague Guichardaz, whom we thank for his contribution, awareness-raising courses on smoking and other addictions were presented in schools on this topic, consolidated over time, on the initiative of LILT Val d'Aosta, with the active involvement of the first and second classes of secondary school and a project for the recovery, use and recycling of disposable electronic cigarettes carried out at ISILTEP in Verrès. As regards the ""Addictions"" program, always included in the regional prevention plan, the specific actions, including health promotion, are implemented by the consolidated activity of the Addictions service of the USL Company. The Ser.D. in fact has within it a micro team dedicated to the treatment of nicotine use disorder, composed of a doctor and a psychologist. From the data updated to July 2024, it emerges that 31 patients have been taken care of by the Ser.D., including one minor. In May of this year, the members of the aforementioned team participated in a radio broadcast aimed at the entire population. In the prevention activities carried out with students of lower and upper secondary schools within the scope of the Interinstitutional Table for educational co-responsibility and legality by the Ser.D. operators, the focus is on addictions, naturally in all their aspects. Smoking is treated together with other substance and behavioral addictions. An awareness-raising event aimed at institutions took place on May 31, 2022 at the Fondazione Sistema Ollignan Onlus entitled ""The seduction of smoking"", financed with restricted ministerial funds. Coming to question no. 3, as we have already anticipated during the work of the Regional Council last July, in response to an initiative on the topic of baby smokers, we confirm that within the ""Addictions"" program of the regional prevention plan, in collaboration with the Ser.D. of the USL Company, the planning for 2025 of an awareness-raising activity against smoking is in the initial phase. The initiative is aimed at the younger generations and intends to use forms of communication that are more responsive to the target of the very young people to whom it is addressed and to intercept young people both in school and extracurricular environments. In terms of raising awareness among the youth world, we also inform you that the Youngle project is being implemented by the Ser.D., entrusted to ""Essere Umani onlus"", which aims at primary and secondary prevention and is aimed at the adolescent population. The presentation press conference, among other things, was held on October 9th and had an excellent response. It is in fact a web app, therefore a web application, in which the young person can chat anonymously with a peer about their problems: from sexuality to relationships, naturally up to substances. Peer educators, that is, peer educators, are trained and supervised by professionals and can recommend a referral to dedicated services if necessary. They will also constitute the editorial team responsible for opening social pages in which to convey messages aimed at current lifestyles, including abstention from smoking. A further strengthening of the therapeutic options, therefore secondary prevention, will be given to the use - soon to be introduced - also of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of nicotine use disorder, alongside other treatment aids. We have introduced this treatment in the additional regional LEA with resolution no. 1082/2024 and the treatment will be free for the entire resident population of the Aosta Valley. We remind you that we are the only and first Region at the moment to have included transcranial in the additional free LEA for its population."

It is a very complete, very technical response, where she provided a lot of data. Obviously we wanted to underline that we re-presented this initiative even though one had already been made by colleague Lucianaz in July, because within the response that she had already provided then there were still data, which she has now reconfirmed to me, of studies done in 2022. Since this article, which we cited in the introduction, came out at the end of September 2024, reporting data at a national level, we wanted to understand the picture at a regional level updated to today to understand if further investigations had been done or there was the possibility of undertaking new paths to have more up-to-date data, which give a general picture of the most up-to-date problem regarding this problem of the effects of smoking. English: You answered us in a complete way, but reporting in your answer much of what had already been reported in July, therefore on the various initiatives that the department is undertaking we are pleased, obviously focusing attention through these inspection initiatives on issues on which we are convinced that everyone is paying the utmost attention, trying to do more and more excellent work, more and more synergy between what is health, education, youth world, to try to reduce these problems as much as possible, but above all to raise awareness. At the same time, as has been reiterated in this article that we have cited, through these initiatives, these projects, that there is an increasing presence of health specialists in the sector who bring in a better way, in a more representative way, but at a technical level the situations and above all the problems to make people understand what we can face. Our attention will always be very much on this issue, we trust that there are increasingly important projects in this regard. Here too you told me what had already been reported in July that in collaboration with the Ser.D. is in the initial planning phase for 2025. This is what you said today and it is the same thing that was reported in July, so we understood that, in this respect, we are still in the development phase of this project. We have not had any major details ahead precisely because it is probably still in the development phase. It will certainly be very important to start in a complete and in-depth way under this topic, as we have already reiterated, so later we will return to the topic, not in a critical and polemical way, but to bring attention to this problem together."
47955,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,2,3778,"Within the health and social welfare plan there are two objectives: MA 4.2 and MA 5.4, reported in the premises. The first aims to reorganize governance within the regional welfare system, with specific reference to the separation of the social policy programming function from the service management function through the establishment of an instrumental body to which the management of social-welfare services will be entrusted, including the socio-professional service, as an essential level of social benefits. The second aims to establish the control room for the definition of the new organizational and management structure of social services and interventions, the preparation of a feasibility study for the establishment of an instrumental body and the manager of social services and the revision of the Valle d'Aosta area plan. The initiative is from October 4th. At the previous Council, a question was discussed with Councilor Marzi entitled: ""News on the meetings of representatives of the Regional Government with cooperative societies in relation to the future management of micro communities"", during which the Councilor had already partly given a piece, which was then useful for the preparation of this interpellation, in particular the contents of resolution no. 282, therefore of the control room and also of the assignment to an external body with proven skills and experience in the field of programming and review of organizational, procedural, management models of services in the context of social policies to be supported by the structures of social policies. We then found in the Economic and Financial Document in two sections, one relating to the Presidency of the Region, a passage, of which I quote a part, namely the fact that the appropriate assessments will be carried out regarding the evolution of the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta S.p.A. and the services provided by it in order to rethink the legal structure with particular reference to the new needs for the provision of social, social-welfare and socio-educational services. A part then in the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, which in fact takes up the objectives that have been represented in the health and social welfare plan. What we ask the Councilor is: ""if the potential ""constituting"" instrumental body, as mentioned in the two passages of the Regional Economic and Financial Document, corresponds to the same""; I apologize for the typo, not ""the same"", obviously. It seems like a trivial question, but in reality it is not, because objectively even in the DEFR hearings the doubt has arisen every now and then, even in those of the previous DEFR, so at least the question is clear and we will have, I hope, but I am sure, a clear answer. The other questions are: ""what directions were given to the external body entrusted with the support of the offices of the Department of Social Policies with the resolution of the Regional Council - which I have already mentioned - in particular whether among these there are, among other things, indications regarding the assessments regarding the evolution of the Service Company; whether it is intended to involve any third sector bodies during the performance of the activities relating to the support referred to in the previous point and, if so, in what terms; whether in light of the possible creation of the instrumental body referred to in the premises, the Regional Government intends to keep the Valle d'Aosta Service Company ""alive""? I wanted to make it simple, so we have given human life to a company? so deprived of the provision of services in the social, social-welfare and socio-educational fields""."
47955,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6437,"The identification in section 3 of the DEFR 2025-2027, was actually already present in that of 2024-2026, of strategic objectives regarding the management of social services both of the Presidency of the Region and of the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, tends to the same purpose. On the one hand, the focus of the Presidency of the Region is to evaluate the evolution of the Valle d'Aosta Service Company in order to rethink its legal structure, in particular with regard to the provision of social, socio-welfare and socio-educational services. The need underlying the objective expressed in the part of the Department of my responsibility concerns the reorganization of the system of social-welfare services, maintaining the function of programming territorial social policies in the Department, delegating the management of the services to a third party. The objectives therefore respond to the same purpose of evolution in the provision of social services. The question was not only irrelevant, but, in some ways, we must be grateful because, as we have said on various occasions, probably not very effectively, the fact of answering as I have just finished answering, I hope, has the effect of avoiding this type of doubt. Coming to question no. 2: ""what directions were given to the external body that was entrusted with supporting the offices of the Department of Social Policies with DGR 282/2024 and, in particular, whether among these services there are, among other things, indications regarding the evaluation regarding the evolution of the Valle d'Aosta Service Company"", with reference to the directions given to the Poleis company, which is assisting the offices of the Region in preparing the feasibility study, the following was requested. The feasibility study will have to develop a proposal for the establishment of the instrumental body and for the revision of the Aosta Valley area plan in a study report that provides: first point, an assessment of the legal nature that the instrumental body to be established will have to assume, comparing its respective characteristics, strengths and any critical points, also with the aim of applying the public contract to all employees of the future instrumental body, you will remember that this point was treated precisely within the reference Commission by the undersigned in the hearing of the DEFR. Point 2, the assessment of the economic-organizational sustainability concerning the creation of an instrumental body responsible for the management of personal services, with specific reference to the following services: professional social services, services for people with disabilities, residential services for the elderly, residential services for minors, socio-educational services for minors. The study will specifically develop the following aspects: the organizational chart of the instrumental body, the optimal unit cost of the service, the structure of the profit and loss account and balance sheet, criteria and methods of participation of the members in the financing of the company, organizational methods aimed at ensuring the coordination of the social policy programming function with the function of managing personal services, with specific reference to the reorganization of the competences of the Social Policy Department in relation to the activities delegated to the company. Point 3: a model for reviewing the functions and methods of operation of the regional area plan, as a tool for programming regional social and socio-health policies integrated with other sectoral policies. The study project also includes support for the structures of the Regional Administration in preparing the bill aimed at establishing, precisely, the instrumental body and the related report. Coming to question no. 3 ""whether it is intended to involve any third sector entities during the performance of the activities relating to the support referred to in the previous point and, if so, in what terms"", it is beyond our understanding why it would be necessary or appropriate to involve third sector entities during the performance of the activities relating to the preparation of the feasibility study. This is a feasibility study for the establishment of an instrumental body of the Region, therefore at this moment the regional structures involved are working together with the company entrusted with the technical assistance, therefore the structures pertaining to labor policies, the Department of Social Policies and of course the Superintendence of Studies, in addition to the involvement of the Department of Personnel and the Management of Service Companies. Once the feasibility study is completed, whose delivery is scheduled for the end of the current year, all the necessary assessments, including political ones, can be made and therefore the trade unions and the relevant stakeholders will be involved, as already communicated to them, including of course the third sector bodies that are represented, among other things, in the tables of the area plan for the concertation phase. At the moment, therefore, we are still in the preparation phase of the feasibility study which, as you can imagine, absolutely expresses a whole series of complexities to which an answer must be given, those recalled, in fact, in the answer to question no. 2. Once this phase is completed, the feasibility study will provide useful elements for political discussion and with the relevant stakeholders regarding the establishment of the instrumental body. Coming to question no. 4 ""whether, in light of the possible creation of the instrumental body mentioned in the premises, the Regional Government intends to keep alive the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta S.p.A., thus deprived of the provision of services in the social, social-welfare and socio-educational fields"", as is known, you know better than I, the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta guarantees the provision of a whole series of activities, not only in the area of ​​personal services, but also with regard to services related to culture, forestry construction and road works. For these activities it would therefore remain operational."
47955,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,6,2273,"Councillor, do you remember the proof of 9? It didn't always work, but it was useful to understand if the numbers added up. My question no. 3 had a similar purpose to the proof of 9, it's not certain that it works, but at least for the moment it makes me understand that the calculations more or less add up. The first question, yes, answers the doubts or, better, it was thought that there was a need at least to have a clear answer, also because, as you rightly recalled, the same indication was already present in the previous DEFR, but already at the time we had some doubts and the hearings organised already last time had not given a univocal, or in any case clear, answer. Let's take note of the elements that constitute the assignment given to the consultancy firm, we will see what the final outcome will be. Obviously there are two issues on which I would like to focus more than anything else. I repeat: it is a banal observation but you will accept it. Certainly the company's financing structure... I say this because, also with respect to what was already said in a previous question, it should never be trivialized or simplified, because obviously once you start it is good that the structure is well defined so as not to have to run for cover. It will also be important to understand the methods relating to the application of the public contract considering that today we have a company reality that, although publicly owned, still has its own specificity, so we will see what the results of the study will be. As for the last question, yes, it is true, perhaps this too may have seemed a trivial question, but perhaps it should be discussed more in the context of the overall management of the subsidiaries than in the context of its specific delegations. It is true, it remains in place for other purposes, however, also seeing some indications or in any case clarifications that are made in the latest reports on the management of the company's budget, or in any case also within the planning documents, it is obvious that a further evaluation will have to be made to avoid that the company has some lack of profitability in the face of the loss, allow me a parallel, of the business units, which obviously will go within the scope of the instrumental body."
47956,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,3387,"With this interpellation we return to the topic of autism, because we talked about it on the occasion of the regional economic and financial document in which in the part dedicated to social policies, and evidently also to disability, a series of interventions were highlighted, a series of actions, a bit - let's say in quotation marks, forgive the term, it's not the correct one, but just to be clear - to ""boast"" what have been the things implemented by virtue of the ministerial funds that are made available. In the meantime, a verification that we carried out directly with the Ministry, as well as... a letter that we then wanted to report, there are large excerpts of it in the interpellation, but it is a letter that was sent both to the members of the V Commission and evidently, I imagine, also to you, Councilor, however the ANGSA association directly highlighted some critical issues and above all raised an alarm. As we reported in the text of the interpellation, the association intends to share the concern about the timing of implementation of the ministerial decrees of January 24 and February 6, 2023 and, in particular, this is the central part of this interpellation, regarding the funds allocated to basic or applied research, to the increase in the staff of the national health service, to training initiatives, to the development of the territorial network and individualized life projects and to the improvement of assistance to people with autism spectrum disorder. We know that some discussions had taken place precisely on this, some fruitful because it must absolutely be recognized when there are positive parts, others less so, but more than for lack of will, let's say for the issue of the tight timing. In fact, the association writes: ""More than a year later, it is clear that the aforementioned decrees have not yet been implemented in the health sector. Recalling the need for an early, systemic and long-life intervention program, in the face of more than 200 people with autism in the regional territory, whose needs are still awaiting answers, ANGSA VdA hereby intends to urge the competent structures to promptly implement the aforementioned decrees"". With this letter, the association evidently intends to illuminate, highlight, and make known what is a bit of a critical issue, namely the delays. In fact, the association writes: ""The failure to use the funds within the appropriate timeframe and their consequent return to the Ministry would constitute a serious missed opportunity, which would harm the entire population with autism and the families of the area, compromising the improvement of their quality of life, the possibility of recovery and enhancement of residual abilities and frustrating the implementation of the expected new services, with important repercussions in the care of new generations of subjects with autism"". It is therefore clear that an alarm raised, I believe, in a polite manner by the association absolutely deserves a response, obviously equally polite, but I know that you are, Councilor, to understand if these funds can actually be used, with what timing and to avoid that they may be lost, that therefore they cannot be used."
47956,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,3975,"I answer the two questions, namely ""what are the reasons for the delay highlighted by the ANGSA VdA association and whether every useful action has been prepared to use the funds in a timely manner"". First of all, it is important to underline how the dialogue between the Department and the USL Company is constant and continuous also on the topic of autism. With regard to the funds in particular, with the resolution of the Regional Council n. 628/2023, the activity plans concerning autism spectrum disorders were approved to be used on the funds referred to in the ministerial decree of 24 January 2023, for a total of just over 302,000 euros, and the ministerial decree of 6 February 2023, for 269,591 euros. The latter includes: the study of basic or applied research projects, the increase in the number of personnel of the national health service responsible for providing the interventions envisaged by the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders, developed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, the implementation of training initiatives, the development of a territorial network with the function of recognition, diagnosis and early intervention on neurodevelopmental disorders and individualized life projects based on the concept of quality of life. The purposes and initiatives are aimed at improving assistance to people with autism spectrum disorders both in terms of effectiveness in relation to the quality of life of those affected and their families, and in terms of organizational adaptation of the regional health and social-assistance networks. All of this was naturally shared with the regional technical table, established with the resolution of the Council n. 1633 dating back to 2017, which includes, among others, representatives of the two departments of the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, the Department of Superintendence of Studies, the Department of Labor and Training Policies, the University of Valle d'Aosta, the USL Company, including general practitioners and pediatricians of free choice, associations of relatives of subjects affected by autism spectrum disorder, in addition to significant support also guaranteed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. Regarding institutional courtesy, the technical table meets periodically and the meetings have always been fruitful opportunities for discussion and sharing, as also highlighted in the letter you mentioned... I quote verbatim ""recognizing the Department's merits in having maintained constant attention to the resources made available by the National Fund"". The topic of programming and carrying out activities related to funding was also the subject of analysis in all meetings of the technical table that met during the current year on March 7, June 21 and August 7. The technical table will soon be reconvened, providing for an update, as also requested by ANGSA, regarding the interventions envisaged by the activity plans within the ministerial funds in question. Among the various actions to be taken advantage of the aforementioned funds already implemented in order to provide a response to the increase in cases of diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, we can mention the increase in human, professional and trained resources dedicated to existing services, the increase in individualized therapeutic plans, as well as the activation of support paths for school, social and work inclusion. Periodic technical meetings are also currently being held between the Department and the USL Company focused on the development of the territorial care network. At the moment, therefore, the programming and the activity already underway provide for the use of state resources for the purposes decided. Finally, we inform that the project proposal for both the new 2024 and 2025 funds has also been submitted to the Ministry."

It is quite clear that the letter that arrived after, obviously, the convocation of the technical table and before the convocation of the one you announced, therefore the next one, therefore the last convocation dates back to August, underlines and highlights a problem and a need. For maximum transparency, I highlighted that there was an active collaboration with the Department. You wanted to emphasize it, but I had obviously said it too. However, it is equally clear that, if everything were actually without any critical issues, this letter would not have been necessary. I obviously thank you for your response, the hope I can make is that the technical table can meet as soon as possible, therefore when you announced the convocation... and that from this there can then be some positive news, because it is clear that the alarm raised is certainly worrying, therefore the fears are absolutely well-founded. We hope that, in the face of the new convocation, there will be some definitely positive responses."

We are talking about free additional services in healthcare. What are free additional services? They are those services that management staff and healthcare sector staff, and not only, perform or have the right to perform to reduce waiting lists and reduce the use of outsourcing. These services are paid with a sum that is predetermined on the basis of a company agreement, where the trade union forces also intervene. The State financial law, no. 13/2023, in paragraphs 218, 219 and 220, has allowed these sums to be raised, determining a maximum figure and an amount to be allocated to the Regions. Valle d'Aosta benefits from an amount, which is equal to 588,000 euros, of which 420 for management staff and 168,000 for sector staff. Following this determination, the Regional Council, through a Council resolution, which for us was made in April 2024, at no. 405, determines the destination of these sums. The Council, led by President Testolin, has decided, on the proposal of the Councilor and after consultation with the trade unions, to allocate this amount only to the personnel who deal with the emergency urgency, determining an hourly compensation of 100 euros for the medical management staff and 60 euros for the health personnel of the health sector. With the interpellation we ask what are the reasons behind the choice to recognize different hourly spending commitments between the emergency urgency and the other departments, when the reference standard allows to proceed with the same figures in all the structures and if there is the intention to adjust the amounts also for the other structures where the possibility of carrying out the LPA aimed at reducing waiting lists and reducing the use of outsourcing is foreseen. Thanks for your reply."
47957,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,4391,"Let's come to question no. 1 of the initiative ""what are the reasons behind the choice to recognize different hourly spending commitments between the emergency department and the other departments, when the reference standard allows to proceed with the same figures in all the facilities"" and to question no. 2 ""if there is an intention to adjust the amounts also in relation to the other facilities where the LPA is foreseen aimed at reducing waiting lists"". The 2023 budget has assigned and transferred to the Valle d'Aosta Region, in derogation of the rules of self-financing of the regional health service, the total amount of 588,000 euros, of which 420,000 euros for management staff and 168,000 euros for sector health personnel for each of the years 2024-2025-2026. This total amount constitutes the spending limit for each Region and autonomous Province. In light of the aforementioned legislation, the Department, the USL Company and the trade unions agreed on the need to maintain the company freelance profession for the emergency and internalizations at the value of 100 euros per hour for medical managers and at the value of 60 euros per hour for healthcare personnel in the healthcare sector up to the capacity of the allocated budget. For all other cases, the contractual rule for doctors was applied in the minimum amount of 80 euros. This agreement has its rationale in the following considerations. First of all, the budget for the Company Free Profession, the LPA, both the one connected to the financial and the contractual one, is defined and non-derogable. An increase to the maximum value of all services would in fact have significantly reduced the overall hours that could be provided and, consequently, reduced the services obtainable for citizens. Secondly, all hours, even those paid at the minimum value of 80 euros per hour, have guaranteed doctors a considerable increase in compensation (+30%) compared to the previous remuneration of 60 euros per hour. Legislative Decree no. 73/2024 on waiting lists in Article 7 has also provided, and you know it, for everyone a tax discount on LPA hours, moving to an Irpef taxation of 15%, i.e. the substitute tax on additional services of healthcare personnel, thus generating an increase in the net value paid to workers. Emergency services, by their nature, cannot be delayed or not provided and already provided for the treatment of 100 euros per hour. These are the ones for which it is necessary to give priority and guarantee continuity to the compensation already guaranteed. The services related to internalization are also equally a priority, also due to the provisions that have blocked the possibility of renewal or a new call for outsourcing of services, even in the absence of staff as you know, see article 10 of 34/2023. For example, the third emergency department clinic and emergency department radiology had to be taken over by the dependent staff upon expiration of the contract. The hourly value brought to 100 euros for doctors has effectively allowed the service to be maintained unchanged, moving from the token operators to the staff of the radiology facility, as, among other things, has often been requested within this Council. Colleague Restano, and you know this for the ongoing relationships with your Company, it was the operators themselves, due to the sense of responsibility that distinguishes them, who wanted to give the maximum figure of 100 euros a connotation of exceptionality. What I can tell you about these initiatives is also linked to the fact that your questions are part of a logical discourse that does not see the workers in the sector, doctors, nurses and all 26 health professions working for this exceptionality. You will agree with me that this is the approach, on which questions like yours can then be asked, which makes it clear that these tools, LP and LPA, are additional tools that serve to provide an answer to a problem that is very difficult to manage. Other types of approaches do not grasp the connection of exceptionality. In some other questions of the day it almost seems that for some the exceptionality wants to be the norm, but, as you point out with your question, this is not the case."

The interpellation wants to highlight that, since the State law, which sets clear and evident limits on the basis of which you have moved, in Article 118 establishes as a prerogative that the financing is aimed at reducing waiting lists and the use of outsourcing, it does not set limits to the departments, but by applying it in this way and, I repeat, you do it within the terms of the law, it is reduced on one side, but it is increased on the other. There are equally urgent tests, of a radiological or other type, which are not affected by the LPA or at least cannot be affected to date. The purpose of the interpellation is to invite you to try to find a different solution, that is to allow further investment in the Company, in free company services or, to define them in another way, in free services within the Company, so as to avoid the continuous recourse to companies outside the Valley by the people of the Aosta Valley, or to outsourcing, which evidently do not bring advantages to the economy, bring damage to the environment, risks to health and are starting to become a social problem. I believe that these four reasons are sufficient to go in derogation of certain rules or at least to ask you to want to look into the matter in more depth, therefore meeting the needs of the population and also incentivizing health professionals."
47958,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,5103,"The Regional Council, with resolution no. 1086 of 9 September 2024, established the technical political table and the control room for the reorganization and strengthening of the regional system of interventions and services for people with disabilities. This table will have to deal in particular with the revision of law no. 14/2008. The resolution also starts the procedure to identify an external subject who will have to draw up the feasibility study for the period 2024/2025. In the text of my interpellation a part of the title of resolution no. 1086 has gone out, I apologize. However, the text shows the will of the Region to reform the Aosta Valley system regarding disability, with the support of technical assistance and it is a fully shared objective. In relation to this important intervention that will take place, in the past weeks, now a month ago and more, we received the letter sent by one of the associations that deal with disability in our territory: the Famiglie 162 Committee for the implementation of law no. 162 in Valle d'Aosta. In this letter we are reminded that ""any reform of the rules that concern the world of disability must take place in the wake of law no. 227/2021 ""Delegation to the Government on disability matters"" and with reference to the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities"". These are documents that we have already had the opportunity to discuss in this chamber and we have also done so in the Commissions. In addition to the aforementioned law, no. 227, we must also take into account the important implementing decrees that have been issued by the national Government, which provide for the launch of policies for the deinstitutionalization of services, what we could define as standard services, with increasing attention to forms of personalized support. This is an important paradigm shift, considered very positive for many personal situations, by those who have always been concerned with the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. : The request that specifically comes from Committee 162 regarding the definition of the new system is a request that we know is shared by many other associations and is aimed at working so that this new system - I quote from the letter - ""is not aimed at thinking of new or better services intended as places, walls, dedicated spaces, or segregating, but is aimed at creatively designing new methods, which allow each citizen with disabilities to have support that compensates for their impairment or fragility to give concreteness to their life project in everyone's world"". This seems to me to be an objective as important as it is challenging, which expresses with great clarity the need to respect the individuality of people with disabilities and to concretely take charge of everyone's life project, a project that unfortunately often has to be scaled down and revised due to obstacles arising from an assistance system that also needs to be revised and strengthened. Also because, I recall, the UN Convention, which has become Italian State law, n. 162/1998, from which the association I mentioned takes its name, establishes that ""the person with a disability has the right to choose where, with whom and how to live"". The Families Committee 162 then expresses the hope of being able to participate together with all the other stakeholders in the process of reviewing the regional law: n. 14/2008 and, more generally, in the reorganization of the regional system of interventions and services for people with disabilities. It is true that in the resolution I mentioned, n. 1086, it is stated that the working table will also include representatives of the associations that deal with disabilities in the region, however, given that reference is normally made to the most representative associations, precisely because it is usually so, we understand a wish on the part of this association, but also on the part of other associations, which express the same hope, that is, to be a truly active part of this important process of review, because we know that it will then have consequences on the entire regional disability system. It is for these reasons that we ask the Government to know whether the assessments that led to the formulation of the resolution included a thorough examination of law no. 227/2021 and whether legislative decree no. 62 of 3 May 2024, which is specific to personalized life projects, was taken into account. We ask this because the letter we received rightly refers to the fact that is not mentioned in the resolution. It is important to understand it because it truly outlines processes for evaluating and preparing personalized life projects with methods that are new compared to the past. The second question is: ""if there is the intention to involve the various associations that deal with disabilities in Valle d'Aosta and that intend to actively collaborate in the process of reviewing the law""."
47958,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,2623,"With reference to the interpellation presented by my colleague, which is based on the note sent to me and the Councillors responsible for disability by the Family Committee 162 for the implementation of law no. 162 in the Aosta Valley, I am responding today, as I noted, together with the Coordinator of the Department of Social Policies, on 9 October last, to the President of the Committee 162. The planned reform of regional law no. 14/2008 is necessary because, in addition to being a rather dated system - we talked about it when we talked about the DEFR and I am pleased that, when it comes to making interpellations, it is made known that at least the process of reviewing no. 14 has started - precisely following the approval of the delegation law no. 227/2021 and the related implementing decrees, it is more urgent than ever to rethink policies in favor of people with disabilities that are respectful of the most recent guidelines on the matter deriving both from the aforementioned national regulatory framework and, as you recalled, from the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In this sense, the fact that the text of resolution no. 1086/2024 refers to delegation law no. 227/2024 and not to the subsequent implementing legislative decrees should not be understood as a devaluation of the implementing provisions but, on the contrary, as a desire to adopt those principles and purposes expressed in the delegation law, which are then subject to detailed regulation in the decrees approved by the Government. Coming to the second question, namely ""whether it is the intention to involve the various associations in Valle d'Aosta that deal with disabilities and that intend to actively collaborate in the process of reviewing regional law no. 14/2008"", I believe I can state, as is also clear from the resolution of the Council no. 1086, that this process intends to be as participatory as possible, giving the widest space both to the stakeholders and to all those who wish to collaborate, as already happened on the occasion of the launch of regional law no. 14/2008, which already followed an absolutely participatory path. It is also important to recall, and you mentioned it, that in the resolution of the Regional Council no. 1086 there is talk of a technical table and a control room with a technical composition and that in the technical table it is expressly recalled that representatives of the associations for people with disabilities will be involved and, based on the topics discussed, other subjects may also be called to participate."

When you ask a question, you acknowledge that the process has started and here it could not have been done differently because the resolution is clear: the process has started, we know, thank goodness, it was also written in the DEFR. I imagine that your introductory note made in the speech refers in some way to the other process that has started and started with a delayed fuse. When things work, they say, when they work less, they say the same. Beyond this, the interpellation was essentially aimed at receiving reassurances and the second answer that you gave is indeed reassuring or, better, confirms what was expected, however, given that often then those who participate, as also happens in other areas, are the most representative associations, the concern was to be able to all be there. It seems to me that you have confirmed this, so it is certainly good news. On question no. 1 you say: we absolutely did not want to devalue the decree that I cited, that is, no. 62 of 3 May, we included in the citation of law no. 227 also those that were the subsequent steps. Maybe, that's fine. I believe that, considering the importance of that decree, it could have been cited, precisely because in that decree reference is made in a very precise and very timely manner to the issue of the change of the new rules that exist with respect to the extension of a personalized life project, which already existed in the past but which now has a value and a structure that is certainly different and more important. In any case, thank you for your reply."
47959,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8175,"With this initiative we discuss a topic that, unfortunately, often comes back to the fore and how, despite ourselves, we must take note that every opportunity that in theory should serve to wage a just battle against violence and I want to reiterate against any violence, wherever it comes from and whoever it is directed against, is absolutely important. Imagine the surprise when, looking at the resolutions that have come out, we see that two projects have been funded: one costing 10,000 euros and the other more or less the same: 9,990 euros. I am particularly struck by the title of this initiative, because an initiative against violence is called: ""Sex Joy, for non-violent affectivity"". Moreover, I also went to look at the definition of ""affectivity"" and the dictionary says: ""In psychology, a dynamic complex of various feelings"". We will probably talk about feelings, but ""Sex Joy"" left me with some doubts before... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...well, yes, in my opinion, that was the intention. We then did the appropriate in-depth analysis to understand what this project consisted of and we drew a series of ideas from this project, which also earned me the title of I don't remember what a well-known page, a well-known far-left political group, wrote to me. ""Andrea de Torquemada"" perhaps they called me. I wanted to reassure that obviously I will continue to deserve this title. The project tells us that ""the project intends to prevent gender violence and eradicate sexist stereotypes thanks to targeted actions, of an informative and educational nature, but also artistic and cultural, which promote gender equality among the younger segments of the population"". This English is nice because it muddies the waters a little, it tries a little to mask in a positive way what is brought. It is said that ""the first area of ​​objectification of women is precisely the erotic experience"" and they write ? it seems like a political manifesto for this project -: ""we want to bring to the center of local debate issues that still struggle to enter the public agenda due to fear and taboos, with the aim of countering the discriminatory and patriarchal culture in which gender violence is rooted"". A manifesto that seems to me to be reading a little... let's go back to the topic of Trump's victory, which we have happily acknowledged... the topic that some inconsolable feminists have brought up: we have not talked enough about these things, we have not managed to get this issue into the political agenda and therefore people have not voted as we wanted, they have voted in a slightly different way, which we did not like. In short, this project tells us that ""the patriarchal cultural system in which all forms of gender violence are rooted is struggling to defuse"". So essentially the problem is the patriarchal system. I also looked up the definition of ""patriarchal"" and ""patriarchy"" and it is rather curious. I won't read it to you because you know it well, but I certainly don't think it's the root of all evil. They always write in the project ""'Sex Joy, for non-violent affectivity"" ? we always have this contrast between sex and affectivity, which, in my opinion, has little to do with violence ?: ""it places the theme of sexual and affective education at the center of the interventions"". With this project against violence, that is, they want to provide sexual education, at least that's what they say. I won't tell you the name of the person who proposed it, but it's curious because they are in this association, I don't know how to define it... it's called APS, the same people who also do projects for the Municipality of Aosta, little projects for the Region always on the same theme, a little assignment here, a little assignment there. It's curious, they are always the same people who go around and take money. It almost seems like they live off this, that is, that their main activity is to do these projects. It is a danger, because evidently a person tends not to want to solve problems perhaps if these problems give them a living. So this is another issue that I put on the table. Obviously I am not saying that this is the case, but in general, if this type of disclosure becomes a profession, the risk is created. These associations say that ""the project is constituted in various interventions on the themes of gender violence, sexuality and gender equality in the artistic, cultural, informative and educational fields"". There are a whole series of descriptions, which I will cut out for the sake of my country. At point no. 3 of a list of objectives it is said, among other things, that ""we want to spread the discipline of consent, opening the discussion on the future scenarios of the relationship between men and women export""... ""sportare"" is actually written and this is an error that unfortunately is reported in the project, you can see that it is written quite hastily. Moreover here among the subjects proposing the pages, I pointed it out before to another colleague... there are some other errors that are particularly funny. ""Spread the discipline of consent, man-woman relationship, export the themes of contrast to patriarchal culture outside the so-called ""feminist bubble"""". We are all feminists, we must involve men too, let's get them to fight this beautiful political battle. As for spreading the discipline of consent, I am honestly not clear what it means: is it necessary to explain that consent between two people is necessary in order to have an emotional relationship of the type described in ""Sex Joy""? Because if that is the case, I am reminded of that fantastic speech that a prosecutor made a few years ago, who told how immigrants who arrived had to be explained that raping a woman was not okay, because they probably did not know. There is a video, I think many of us have seen it, which is particularly funny and edifying if we then imagine that the same people who say it have to judge these types of crimes. The thing that actually left me particularly shocked is the list of results. At the end of all this beautiful project on sex, on consent, on ""transporting"" the issues and so on, it has results. What are the results for which 10,000 euros were given, money from the taxes of the Aosta Valley? ""The project aims to combat patriarchal culture and gender violence by offering the population opportunities to meet and reflect on innovative issues - cutting-edge issues, we might say - such as sexuality and affectivity, bodies and gender stereotypes, deconstruction of patriarchal culture. In particular, among the expected outcomes of the project is the prevention and fight against gender violence - this is fine, but I would have stopped at violence - educating the young generations of formative age to recognize and fight patriarchal culture - therefore training - in which acts of gender violence are rooted in plural forms, not only violence by men against women - drum roll, I look at my colleagues - not only violence by men against women, but also homolesbotransbiphobia"". So we said it. We have been going around in circles throughout this project, gender violence here, patriarchy there, but we have also stuck a nice rainbow brushstroke at the end. In short, in light of all this, Councilor, I sincerely did not understand... among other things, I apologize, for the record, among the activities that are proposed there is also ""the organization of recreational evenings"". I do not know what ""recreational evenings"" are, but they are written in the project. Maybe I will ask for a specific explanation of what these ""recreational evenings"" are. With the presentation I gave you, I hope I have explained to you what our Region has unfortunately gone to finance and I ask you what the relevance of the project is to the purposes mentioned in the introduction and whether the Administration intends to make a better selection of projects so that they are relevant to the purposes of the law."
47959,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,2225,"Law no. 4/2013 on the prevention and fight against gender violence and support for women victims of gender violence recognizes that all forms of gender violence are a violation of human rights, physical and psychological integrity, freedom and dignity of the person and promotes initiatives to prevent and fight gender violence, including through public awareness and the dissemination of a culture of mutual respect between the sexes. In particular, Article 5 of the aforementioned law defines that the Region promotes projects aimed at implementing initiatives to prevent gender violence, particularly in schools and families, education on mutual respect in the relationship between the sexes, respect for sexual, religious and cultural identities, and non-violence as a method of civil coexistence and provides that anti-violence projects may include awareness and information campaigns on the issue of gender violence. With Resolution no. 401/2023 approved the call for proposals for the 2023 financial year for the financing of anti-violence projects for the prevention and information of gender-based violence, pursuant to Article 5 of the aforementioned Law No. 4/2013, and the specific theme on which the projects should focus and develop was shared within the Permanent Forum against harassment and gender-based violence. The evaluation of the projects, as provided for by paragraph 6 of Article 5 of No. 4/2013, is the responsibility of the Forum. The project in question was presented by the social promotion association Creature Montane APS and to the Forum itself. With reference to the expected results, it is also expected to raise awareness of a non-discriminatory and even less sexist culture of equality towards women. The project was examined by the commission provided for by the Forum which, in full legitimacy, positively evaluated the project in question, considering it consistent with the provisions of Resolution No. 401/2023 and in line with the theme defined within the Permanent Forum against harassment and gender-based violence."

I am close to you, Councilor, I realize the daunting task you are called to, every now and then you even manage to have a moment of pride, as you did yesterday, essentially not sharing what the Neuropsychiatry Service of our Region has done. I must tell you, however, for the next time, on some answers like these, if you manage to feign greater enthusiasm, probably the people who support these projects will be happier. I take note that your evaluations are linked to a mere list of rules, which evidently do not cover what is foreseen in these projects. The exaltation that, among other things, is in the project is beautiful, I repeat, it is not that there are many pages, it will be four/five, but with a lot of errors, so it means that perhaps they were more careful in receiving the funds than in writing the project. As always, then what is written is one thing, what is done I am very curious to know if it also follows the outline. The funny thing, in short, up to a certain point, is that, among other things, a show is exalted with a track, among other things, brought to the stage here in Valle d'Aosta, and not only, by a company from the Aosta Valley that is part of this let's call it ATI, because they are different associations even if they are not companies, but they receive the money and it is called: ""Having Bocca di Rosa as a mother"". This is the title of the show. The funny and recurring thing in this document is that it is always said that the image of women is sexualized and this is wrong, we can absolutely agree on this, but then the show is exalted, which is called: ""Having Bocca di Rosa as a mother"". I don't know, we all generally know Bocca di Rosa's profession, I don't know if this can have a congruence with what is outlined in the project. What remains, however, is that pages and pages are written, they try to confuse words with words, but in the end the line is clear. There is, as my colleague Perron rightly said before, a lobby, which is a very strong lobby, a lobby that is fueled by these actions, which have no intention of doing what they declare. What is done with these actions is simply self-feeding and political propaganda based on this self-feeding. We know very well that this project has no intention of developing results of that type, but, as they wrote, having evenings with tiktokers who present you with the petalous thing, who tell you ""girl power, we are all strong, we are all good"", but maybe next year you will come to the Gay Pride because that way we are many, we prevent homolesbobitransphobia, at least I think that's how it reads, which is obviously not in the law, so you know very well that this is absolutely not within, so much so that... my colleagues will agree, the action you want to do is to insert some traits of the PL n. 64, right in the law you mentioned, so evidently this part is not there but they want to force it in anyway. These results that are highlighted are not the results that we should have, we should have a structure that allows us to protect anyone who even just fears being subjected to violence, we should have a structure that teaches us not to use violence in any case, against anyone, because violence is never the explanation, instead we have hordes of people who feed themselves, who live off projects, who live off these things, they take on a job here today, tomorrow they will take on a small job from the Municipality of Aosta and they live off exactly this in function of the construction of the next project, the next cooperative, the next management. Then maybe it happens that these same people go to manage a public space and say that Fascists cannot enter there, maybe they even lay hands on them or call the police, who knows! I, Councilor, invite you, even though you have not found any inconsistencies, to think more carefully about the next time and to pay more attention to what is paid with our money, otherwise sooner or later, when the Government changes, perhaps these things, as has already been said, will find the taps closed."

We have learned that, in the context of the awareness-raising activities that were carried out in the month of October, the Aosta Valley Section of the Italian League for the Fight against Cancer has launched an appeal with the request to introduce urgent and imperative measures to ensure that early intervention can be done in these situations that occur in the area. Basically, two proposals are made: the first is to lower the age, from 45 to 40 years, in relation to the screening that takes place on an annual basis; the second is at the same time to also start an awareness-raising within the school world to carry out an informative activity in the area regarding this topic. Therefore, with this interpellation we ask the Regional Government and in particular the competent Assessor if it intends to evaluate the reception of this appeal, or to introduce the two requests that have been put forward by the Aosta Valley Section of the League against Cancer."
47960,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,2943,"Thank you, colleague Marquis. First of all, it should be noted that screening for the early diagnosis of breast cancer is usually aimed at women aged between 50 and 69 and is performed with a mammogram every two years. In some Regions, the effectiveness is being tested in a wider age group: between 45 and 74. This expansion of the target in Valle d'Aosta has already occurred since 2016. At a national level, the offer of screening to women aged between 40 and 44 is also being evaluated, but at the moment it does not appear that this age group has already been taken into consideration in a systematic manner by any Region. This expansion is therefore the subject of analysis and comparison in institutional tables, such as the National Screening Observatory and, consequently, we are also doing the same type of evaluation in our Region with respect to the further expansion of the offer of breast screening to this age group as well. At the moment, however, it is objectively a priority for the facilities that deal with screening activities to implement the percentage of adherence to the first level of mammographic screening. In this sense, we are working to develop targeted communication campaigns, a greater offer in the territory and a progressive digitalization of the procedures of the investigation path, which range from the call to the transmission of the result. The results published by the National Screening Observatory for 2023, although naturally limited, as I mentioned before, given that the age in the rest of Italy is 50-69 years, to this age group, therefore excluding from the calculation all the services administered to women aged between 45 and 49 and 70 and 74, show for the regional mammographic screening a percentage of adherence of 47.9% compared to a national figure of 55.4 and Northern Italy of 65.5. For this reason, at the moment we believe - and we are confident that you do too - that it is a priority and an urgent matter to raise awareness among women in the current extended and expected age group to adhere to the checks. In parallel, as mentioned, we will also work to evaluate the strengthening of the screening activity and therefore also to broaden the target audience, as requested. Perhaps, colleague Marquis, this initiative of yours will also help us to carry out prevention and promotion of the screenings that are recalled. Coming to question no. 2, prevention is done in more general terms with respect to the specific topic, premature with respect to the school age group. In fact, in this logic, a collaborative action is being carried out with the Superintendence of Studies, especially within the regional prevention plan, in order to propose secondary prevention messages to young people who should in turn be a vehicle of information and education towards adults."
47960,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,2026,"Thank you Councilor for the response that was given to us. We have essentially advanced what was the request that was proposed by the Aosta Valley Section of the League against Cancer. We realize the difficulty in joining, which is a problem that must be addressed. On this occasion you spoke to us about procedures, digitalization, problems of convocation. In fact there is a whole organizational issue that has not found a solution for too long. We are a small Region and we should be a model in this respect, because it is easier to manage small numbers than large numbers when you have to design a management platform. Therefore we believe that it is correct to proceed with the dissemination and information campaign in schools, because this can be, in a context such as has been represented, an important element to create education towards attitudes that can be positive on the subject, which can then be reported by the world of school and by young people within the family to raise awareness on the issue. We believe that the evaluation is a positive thing to do and we hope that the words you said, where you say that this path will be evaluated, are a real evaluation, that it is done as quickly as possible, because even in Valle d'Aosta the number of people affected by this pathology at a younger age is growing. If you can intervene and find the problem in the initial phase, it is also much easier to be able to intervene in a positive way and with much higher percentages of success. Furthermore, prevention done with due attention is true that it leads to a more effective and more efficient organizational model from a certain point of view, but it is also true that, on the other hand, it then leads to savings in the management of subsequent health expenditure. We therefore trust that this topic will not be underestimated and will be treated with due attention."

Now, all this arises from a series of questions. We have highlighted over time, but we have always been answered by the person who was pro tempore Councilor for Social Policies, the then Councilor Barmasse, and also by you, Councilor Marzi, that in reality it was not true, that the costs of district heating were absolutely in line, indeed they were even lower than the cost of boilers, of the previous LPG. They were therefore all inventions. We then cited several articles for our benefit. An interesting journalistic analysis was done by ""Aostasera"" precisely on the cost of district heating, this for private condominiums, where it was highlighted that the cost of district heating was double or triple compared to the normal cost, let's call it that, of the previous heating system. Now we finally have a testimony from a public body that takes a stand on the issue, because on August 8, 2024 - and we're talking about August - a statement from the Municipality of Aosta comes out, which says: ""Palaindoor only partially used, but the costs of district heating double. The Municipal Council of Aosta has extended the management of the Palaindoor until December 31, 2024 to deal with the high costs of heating. The Municipality will contribute to the heating costs"". Finally, therefore, the fact is acknowledged, even by the public, that district heating is absolutely more expensive than other systems. In the body of the article that reports the part of the statements that the Municipality made, I think on the occasion of the City Council, it says that, to deal with the high costs of heating and the economic difficulties of managing the Palaindoor, the current management is extended until the end of the year and the Municipality ends up paying 50% of the bills, because otherwise the companies that manage it cannot cope. I think this position is clear and clarifies very well what the economic outlay that unfortunately district heating requires is. Let's instead come to another communication, even more clear, that I have already mentioned but I think it is appropriate to take up again and highlight again, where ARER has thought of communicating something important to users. We are grateful for once because we have finally put down in black and white also the critical issues related to district heating. ARER says in a communication sent to tenants: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in past seasons""... and it is strange, moreover, that we are talking about fuel, because you will know, Councilor, that so much has been done to spread the fairy tale of district heating powered by waste from Cogne, therefore a green source, indeed even that it reuses something that would be lost, instead here we realize as if by magic, in reality, district heating uses fuel. I repeat it, among other things, once and for all, once again, because, in my opinion, it helps to understand it: not only when the hot water leaves the plant and goes somewhere else to develop its effects, it clearly loses heat on its way, it loses approximately one or two degrees for every kilometer traveled and the district heating network is 50 kilometers long in the city of Aosta. I'll let you do the calculations. Not only is fuel used to produce that heating source, but then there are revamping plants specifically to avoid the effect of the loss of temperature, which use additional fuel to always heat that water that had started from the other side and was already hot. All this obviously produces costs, multiplied costs. ARER then tells us: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in past seasons and considering the probable continuation of such costs at least for the 2024-2025 season? And here's a twist? Together with the possible limitation of available fuel"". I've said it before at the DEFR, but I'll say it again: do we foresee a war? Is there a fuel limitation? Have the world's oil reserves run out? Have the gas reserves run out? Will Cogne stop working? We don't know, that is, explain to us what's happening. Why will there be a limitation of the available fuel? What's happening? Why is ARER writing to the tenants that they might run out of fuel? It really feels like being below deck on a ship and the cabin boy says: ""Captain, look, we're running out of coal here, we have to slow down"". I put myself in the shoes of a tenant who reads something like that. ""In light of all this? Also the limitation of fuel? A careful and scrupulous use of domestic water heating is recommended"". Limit consumption, wash once a week, do not heat too much, because here you have to limit. ""Both to avoid an excessive increase in individual expenses, and to reduce fuel consumption"" which, as has been said before, could become scarce, or even go to zero and here we freeze to death. Councilor will then remember a discussion on boilers, the famous little boilers, we also talked about it with colleague Baccega, he told us that the boiler system is wrong, it is dangerous, it should be changed, that it cannot be used. ""Buh! How disgusting boilers!"". Where someone opened and closed and knew what he was consuming, if I open I consume and I know how much I consume, I am doing it. Better district heating, which has monstrous costs, but above all a part of undivided consumption, and this is not said. There is a part of consumption that does not only depend on what I use, but a part of condominium consumption, which I would not have paid with my boiler, but this communication tells us: ""Only for tenants who use autonomous heating systems, boilers or alternative forms (stoves) we remind you that before the start of the winter season tenants are required to carry out periodic inspections of the systems used and cleaning of the flues by specialized personnel"". We find at the bottom of this communication the solution to the danger of boilers: commit the tenants to do maintenance. A solution that we could call the Columbus egg. In the face of all this, however, we already have the first effects. I have two bills from last season and the current season. Last season the same user had a consumption estimate for the 2023-2024 season of 450 euros, so in one season he was made aware of the fact that the estimate was 450 euros and that he would consume that amount. The same accommodation is forcibly connected, with guards at the door who throw you out if you don't connect, to the district heating and this year the estimate arrives, which goes from 450 euros in 2023-2024 to 1,750 euros in 2024-2025. An increase that is plastic, is in the cards and is due to the mandatory connection of district heating for all accommodations. This is why, in light of this, Councillor, although it is almost certain that we will not get any answers, other than a strenuous defence of what has already been put in place by ARER, we ask you: whether a comparison has been made between the costs incurred before the connection to district heating and those incurred afterward; if so, what is the outcome of the comparison; if not, whether you intend to do so and, if the cost is higher than the previous one, identify the appropriate methods of support for families in need; what are the reasons for the announced and considerable increases in the cost of fuel and also what is meant by ""limitation of available fuel""."
47961,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,7018,"In the communication note to users sent by ARER to tenants, emphasis is placed on the careful and scrupulous use of heating and domestic hot water precisely to be of help in limiting their use and, therefore, to also have adequate attention to expenses. Precisely because ARER, as recalled by its presentation and also by its initiative, in reality does not only carry out the role of condominium administrator, but also of a subject involved in the management of socio-housing hardship. Normally a landlord, a condominium administrator, whether renting or owning, does not send this type of communication to tenants: this is true precisely because ARER in reality also carries out that type of service. English: The Department also requested data comparing the costs incurred before the connection to district heating and those incurred afterward and there is no increased cost for users connected to district heating compared to previous or alternative supplies, neither in the 2021-2022 season, nor in the 2022-2023 season, nor even in the 2023-2024 season. For the maximum protection of its tenants, a contract was signed with the Telcha company, which guarantees the maintenance over time of the agreed economic convenience, equal to 16.64%, compared to other alternative sources available on the market, with particular reference to the price of gas in relation to the overall cost. Therefore, regardless of the private dynamics that may exist between a public structure, managed by a subject, and the district heating company, which you mentioned in the presentation of the initiative, this does not concern the dedicated relationships that both I and my colleague Barmasse have repeatedly recalled, which exist between ARER and Telcha. Not because it is not the public's duty to reason about who supplies district heating, but that does not pertain to the initiative because the relationships that bind ARER to Telcha are relationships that must be maintained within certain cost parameters, naturally in favor of those who live in the housing emergency or in the reference public housing. The consumption estimates for the 2024-2025 season are drawn up on the basis of the final accounts of the 2023-2024 season and generally report an average decrease in costs of about 14% of all ARER buildings connected to district heating. The only increase forecasts concern the buildings called Filippini and Stura, in the Cogne district, whose connection will be starting from the 2024-2025 season: therefore, inevitably, it has increased for the simple fact that previously heating was not included in the estimate. As already mentioned, unit costs are guaranteed to be as competitive as possible, but the overall cost of heating also depends, obviously, on the tenants' consumption. In this specific case, it is also useful to report the data that I now represent. The expenditure for buildings connected to district heating is reported below, with a comparison of the last three heating seasons. After the anomalous increase in the 2021-2022 season, there was a significant reduction in costs already in the following season and there is a further reduction for the season just ended. In fact, to date, compared to a 2021-2022 season of 1,071,499 euros, last year in the 2022-2023 season there was already a drop of 20.29% on average, therefore going down to 854,000 euros. At this time there has been a further drop of 14%, as mentioned earlier, which brings the total costs of connected condominiums to 734,000 euros. As regards the whole issue of water and water management, that too is part of a dynamic between a subject appointed to participate in the system of socio-housing hardship and its tenants, because in fact in the management of public spaces, therefore also of council houses, there are parameters and objectives that are given to those who manage public spaces that are also linked to the use of water and energy efficiency. It is important, colleague Manfrin, with respect to history and the countless initiatives that will continue to exist, where in fact you and I do not have to discuss, but rather discuss, with regard to what colleague Lucianaz was referring to yesterday afternoon with respect to a direct line, in reality the direct line exists on the issues. You naturally bring forward certain types of requests and we try to represent the complexity of such a broad management. But I have already told you once and I will repeat it: the story of the difficulties in terms of costs with respect to the tools used to heat the public housing in the Cogne neighborhood, in particular, is a story older than me and you. It is a story that in history has seen, over the last twenty-five years, ""n"" thousand minority Councilors, ""n"" thousand Administrators, who have tried to represent, whatever the choice made to heat the houses in the Cogne neighborhood, by those who collect the just requests of the residents of the protests because they were too expensive and, in fact, find solutions. Every time the solutions that were proposed were found, the next tool that was criticized as too expensive for the management of public housing was the one that was first longed for. Here is my colleague Baccega who will remember the ""n"" thousand discussions in the City Council with the then Deputy Mayor regarding the issue of boilers and heating tools for the same public housing that we are talking about today. At that time, the boilers and every other type of heating tool were longed for to be replaced, with all the delays of the case, by district heating. Then people started to protest because district heating was not being connected as quickly as possible. Even today, you only have to go online and you will find endless discussions between the then Deputy Mayor and a colleague, whom we all know. Today we are at the same point regarding district heating, even if district heating, among other things, in some cases has also been brought up by some minority colleagues, represents from this point of view, not because it is the best solution, but because of the specific relationships that exist between the company that supplies it and ARER, which are expressly dedicated to ARER, a less expensive tool than other forms of heating currently on the market. I know that you will not be happy with this. I believe that fuel is in fact another of the tools for which ARER is keen to communicate... in my humble opinion, that part in the old communication is a typo, but I will let you know. In my opinion, it is still a typo in the old joint communication that was sent last year. I will, however, let you know the reference."
47961,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,4661,"Thank you Councilor for your answer which, as you predicted, evidently does not see us in agreement, but it is not that you do not see us in agreement because of a question of bias. I thank you for the answers you wanted to provide and obviously I also imagine what is the painful task that falls to you every time. I believe that there is an underlying reasoning. What is the point? The point is that today we are dealing, in particular with public residential construction, but it is not only this, because, as I have highlighted several times, the problem of costs concerns and unfortunately also involves private condominiums. I have had experiences of people who connected their condominium and evidently a minute later regretted it when the first bills arrived, but this is a private experience. Having said that, what is the issue? The principle is this, Councilor. I understand, and you are perfectly right, often politics seeks a quibble, something to be able to discuss and above all to agree with the interlocutor who comes raising a problem. But, as I told you, I actually have the comparison between before and after, but I don't think that's the choice, the problem and the issue either. I believe that the problem, the issue on which this question of costs has not been digested, was the imposition. The imposition generates a dispute. If people had been put in the position of choosing whether to connect to district heating or keep the old heating system, I believe that all of this would have been digested better. I'll tell you more, Councilor: the people who were threatened - I have brought this up several times in this Council - that if they did not allow the workers to enter the housing they would be thrown out of their homes, have made an extra move. Because they were rightly told: well, this is considered an improvement to the housing, so you are obliged to let the workers in. Fine, let's let them in. But I'm keeping my old system. I'll make you do all the connections you want, I'll keep my old system, which I'll have the appropriate checks done and I'll use that one, that wasn't allowed either. ARER stubbornly said: ""woe betide you, we're seeing that you're not consuming with district heating, woe betide you. Close it down, remove your system immediately"". This is not a motivation of costs or no costs, this really seems like a vindictive issue: ""Oh yeah, you won't let me do what I want? Oh yeah, you won't let me? You won't use the system I gave you? Then I'll beat you"". This is profoundly wrong. After that, it's a question of costs. You say it's not a more expensive system. Let's assume I believe you and you're acting in good faith, rightly so. I don't know if you've had a comparison or if you've actually had the bills, because I wouldn't trust the tables they give me, an Excel table made by a surveyor who tells me: the cost before was like this and then the cost was this. This is manipulation, in the sense that one person manipulates one cost and another. I would ask: excuse me, can you give me the history of a bill for that accommodation from 2021 and 2024? It is something grave, if there is an increase, it is clear that I will detect an increase, I will read it. Since, I repeat, I do not know if you have this, but I think they have made you a summary table, you should trust it. You do not want to trust what I tell you and what I show you, at least trust the statements of the Municipality of Aosta. It is the Municipality of Aosta itself that says: ""The Palaindoor is only partially used, but the costs of district heating are doubling"". The Municipality of Aosta says it, not me. How come the Municipality of Aosta detects a doubling of the cost of heating and the ARER does not? Do they use two different district heating systems? No, because we are in a monopoly regime, the monopolist is one, he provides everything. So, you understand, there is a discrepancy on this: either they increase for everyone or they do not increase for anyone. You say that there are preferential prices regarding the ARER: I take note of it, but in reality the bills say something completely different. You may eventually and rightly modify and motivate what you deem most appropriate, but this is not a political quibble, unfortunately this is a fact. I hope that you can pay due attention to what I told you and I hope that somehow, sooner or later, we can arrive at the possibility of giving people the freedom to heat themselves as the hell they prefer."
47962,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., Personale medico e paramedico",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,2,2293,"Waiting lists are still the biggest problem for Italians who deal with the health service and their impact is so large that it contributes to inducing approximately one in 13 Italians to give up treatment. This emerges from a report released ten days ago and presented in Rome. The data refers to 2023. Eye exams scheduled for 120 days, which move four times as much, almost 500 days; the same for eco-Doppler, class B eye exams, hip replacements, etc. 7.6 of citizens have given up treatment, almost 1% more than in 2022 and almost 2 out of 3, 4.5%, do so precisely because of the long waiting lists. The rate of giving up among women is higher than among men. I presented this initiative some time ago, Councilor, because the citizens of the Aosta Valley, as you can well imagine, as is often and willingly heard in this chamber, rightly ask for information and clarifications. English: What is the situation in Valle d'Aosta? According to an Agenas survey on the ratio between visits provided in ordinary form and those in intramoenia, during 2022, which seems to be the latest data available, the Valle d'Aosta Region has once again recorded one of the indicators that is defined as the most critical in Italy: compared to 87% of ordinary visits, in intramoenia it reaches 12.25%. Specialist visits in intramural mode, therefore outside the normal working hours of doctors, have a waiting time that is decidedly lower than the ordinary one. Here, I imagine, because it is preferred by the Val d'Aosta people, practical people, who when they have an emergency, a need, see to dealing with it as soon as they can. Of course, this is not for everyone's budget and in fact it is not so easy for everyone to be able to access this service. Fortunately, however, that the situation in Valle d'Aosta of the waiting lists is less serious than elsewhere, can certainly also contribute to this fact. I won't go on any further, also because in the inspection act I filled you with popular rhetoric, where you certainly excel compared to me, so I won't go any further. The initiative was to provide the public opinion of the Aosta Valley with some data and the terms of the question of how much the intramural profession affects, precisely, the Aosta Valley health system."
47962,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,7716,"English: In order to immediately excel in the art of dialectics, the first thing that comes to mind for you regarding initiative no. 80 is to reach an agreement with your new group colleague, colleague Restano, regarding the LPA, because he maintains that the LPA should be given in a more extensive manner and you, in no. 80, maintain that the LPA should be numbered differently. Now we will try to explain some aspects. The phenomenon of waiting lists, as we have already had the opportunity to share on several occasions, is the main health problem perceived not only by our community, but by the entire population on the national territory. It is a topic that, as is known, is continually brought to the attention of the media, even if most of the time the information provided is aimed more at making noise than at giving correct indications and solutions to citizens. With this I am obviously not talking about you, colleague Lucianaz, but I am talking about those who use this tool to distract. We reiterate once again how the problem is essentially linked to the lack of doctors and therefore to the difference between supply and demand for services. Therefore, it is clear that, beyond the specific issue you mentioned in the initiative, this widespread problem will exist until truly useful paths to finding these figures are identified at a national level, also with a significant review of the sector contracts. For years, the concrete commitment undertaken together with the USL Company has been aimed at announcing numerous competitions, creating agreements and pursuing collaborations with other regional entities. In this sense, the data that the USL Company communicates regarding participation in competitions have been the subject of discussion in the chamber several times. Precisely because the phenomenon is dated in the years and heavily involves the entire national territory, the Government in office, at the gates of last summer, issued a specific decree-law, which we have already discussed in the chamber on several occasions, the last time in July 2024, effectively recognizing its structural dimension within the national health service. To implement the various regulations on the subject, we were forced, with resolution of the Regional Council no. 1185 of 30 September 2024, to approve the establishment of the Central Unit for the management of healthcare and waiting times and lists, composed of healthcare and administrative professionals. We are therefore following all the requirements set out in the national law on the matter, as well as the activation of the national waiting list platform and lastly the appointment of the Sole Responsible for Regional Healthcare which took place at the end of last October. Pending this activation, Agenas, which you mentioned, will activate a new data flow relating to specialist services starting from 1 January 2025 which will replace the current one. Furthermore, the USL Company has already revised the discipline of the protection pathways which provides that the patients who are unable to be provided with visits within the prescribed times are offered alternative solutions by the Company itself, mediating additional activities organized by the Company, or through the appeal always with the sole payment of the ticket of the accredited private individual. Let us now respond to the specific points of your initiative. Point 1: ""how many local health care doctors work in the intramoenia regime and where do they work?"" Intramoenia is called LPI. The doctors of the USL Company who carry out intramoenia private practice - and therefore outpatient and surgical - are 158 out of a total of 297, practically only half. They carry out this activity at the various company facilities, therefore the Umberto Parini hospital, the Beauregard and the facilities on via Guido Rey n. 3, the so-called ""outpatient clinics"". We also remember that the facility where, in fact, intramoenia activity was centralized was one of the various things required in the various regulations that have chased each other over the decades for the management of waiting lists that required that intramoenia activities be all centralized in one place. The autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta was perhaps the only or one of the very few regions in Italy to try to manage waiting lists in one of the various decrees that have followed one another over the last twenty-five years for the management of the issue. Let's come to question no. 2 ""how many visits in private practice were carried out in 2023 and divided by specialist visit or other visits"". English: As regards the number of services performed during the year 2023, given the impossibility of listing in detail the significant amount of data, the project of services that find their source in the Agenas monitoring is made available by email, which you will surely already have and, if you do not have it, we will provide it to you, because it is a public table on which, regarding this latest regulatory variant, we also arrive at this file. Among other things, in this table we are in the average of the non-solution of the problem and only in four cases a little worse. ""How many institutional hours has each individual doctor adhering to intramoenia performed and how many have they performed as a freelancer"": the evaluation of the relationships between institutional activity, therefore the ordinary one, and the intramoenia freelance activity, which the latest national regulations on waiting lists have brought to attention, has always been monitored by the USL Company. The comparison is made between volumes of services provided per team. We therefore confirm that the relationship is maintained, as can be seen from the data provided. The institutional activity is always superior to the intramoenia one because on this point it is useful to specify that the institutional employment relationship provides for 38 hours per week, while the freelance activity does not exceed 10 hours per week on average. ""What actions does the competent Councillor intend to adopt in agreement with the Health Authority with respect to the last aspects"": as we have already highlighted, the USL Authority has always guaranteed over the years compliance with the relationship between institutional activities and intramoenia activities. There are various actions aimed at encouraging staff to perform activities in the institutional sphere, also through paid work in company freelance work, which is the LPA, referred to in initiative no. 73 by colleague Restano. The object of contention, in my humble opinion - and with this there is absolutely no will to dislike initiative no. 80 - is linked to the fact - and we will also have the opportunity with respect to no. 81 to intervene on the merits - to take into consideration what are currently the three main problems that the Italian public health system has: the first is the number of professionals, of any characteristic, therefore both medical professionals and the other 26 health professionals; the second is the financing of the public health service; the third is the waiting lists. Of these three gigantic problems, the waiting lists are naturally the most hated by the population, as I already had the opportunity to declare in July, but I am not the only one doing so, otherwise even the national government, which has just transformed a decree into law, would not now be re-editing another decree to manage the issue. The problem of waiting lists is a separate problem for the Italian public health system, including the regional one. It is the one most hated by everyone and it is the one, unfortunately, that has the least solution of all."

I had asked you some more specific questions, well, we'll see what we can get out of this file. What the man in the street, like me, is wondering? Without being Bocca di Rosa, but am I in the street too?, is that perhaps the monopoly regime is bad for a company, because, if the problem is pandemic and has been dragging on for years or decades, probably not the subordinates, but someone at the top must face some organizational problems. I recently heard a head doctor complain about spending more time doing administration than his job as a doctor. Probably these structures have too high an administrative load, we have more officials in the offices than in the corridors... I don't know, but certainly thanks to those who, it's strange to say, operate under the intramoenia regime, which, if nothing else, lightens the load. It seems like a paradox, but thanks to these the lists are certainly lightened. With good will, more can certainly be done. I start with the environmental conditions of this hospital, which are certainly not optimal, but to some it seems that things are fine this way and will continue to be this way for decades to come. I repeat, however, that a company should also find all the strength and energy possible within itself and I would say that they are welcome, that they renew, that they definitely make this machine more efficient. Good work to those at the top of the structure then."

There are health professions that cannot do intramoenia freelance work, but can do LPA and these professions guarantee a health service within the company for the benefit of the population by reducing waiting lists."

The picture of our Region appears to be unedifying compared to this report, but, as is often represented to us in this chamber, those data do not represent reality or at least this is what we are told. In some way, therefore, we would like to understand from the Councilor and we have highlighted some salient issues. First of all, the report highlights that the Aosta Valley has suffered a percentage drop of 27% in total services provided in 2023 compared to 2019, resulting in the second worst data in Italy. It underlines how this reflects a worsening of access and efficiency of the health service. Then there is a worsening of waiting times, a topic already discussed in a previous interpellation. The report highlights a particularly significant increase in waiting times for the oncology area, with a worsening of 17.74% between 2019 and 2022. This is also a particularly critical figure for what concerns urgent and delicate treatments, even if the company has already responded to this in some way, but the Councilor will say so. There is then a focus on the use of intramural freelance professional activity, which we talked about a little while ago. Valle d'Aosta is the second region with a higher percentage of hospitalization services provided in freelance compared to institutional ones: 0.5%, equal to 83 services out of 18,000. This could indicate, but we ask the Councilor, a more frequent use of paid services to make up for deficiencies in public health. There is also a difference between prescribed and provided services. Valle d'Aosta also has the highest percentage: 28% discrepancy between prescribed and actually provided services, another sign of the system's difficulty in ensuring all prescribed treatments. This report, compared also with what has been reported and with what has been done by IRES in the analysis that SPI Cgil gave us, highlights here too those critical issues that we have in some way spoken about at length. We also believe that both Cittadinanzattiva and SPI Cgil have in some way a certain capillarity in our territory and that in some way the fact that these problems are reported I believe is done first of all to try to have answers and above all to somehow encourage improvements. In light of all this, we ask the Councilor if the aforementioned analyses, therefore especially those of the Cittadinanzattiva report, correspond to reality and what actions have been implemented or are intended to be proposed to improve the health system."

First of all, it is important to understand two issues. The first is that the civic health report by Cittadinanzattiva always carries out the analysis on the same data relating to 2022 and in some cases on the data relating to the first half of 2023. This is a normal delay in national reports, but it must be taken into account. It is also important to point out that very often these reports are all drawn up starting from the same sources, such as, for example, the evaluation of the LEA or the new guarantee system. Every time a report is published, a new initiative is presented, but each time it is presented as if it were new data or updated data, but the data on the essential levels of assistance relating to 2022 are always the same. So for the umpteenth time we analyze and explain them. We thank you, therefore, for giving us the opportunity to once again tell of the great commitment and all the attention that both the Department and the USL Company are investing to improve and strengthen both the quality of the data and information that are disclosed, and the services provided. I think that the 2022 data will be at least the sixth or seventh time that we have analyzed them in the classroom. Fortunately, in the meantime they are improving. As I anticipated, I confirm that we have already had extensive opportunity to comment on the data reported to attention and these have certainly been an important starting point for reflection to start improvement actions. Today we can therefore update the situation and report a value closer to us than the information published and referred to 2022, or to the beginning of 2023. Coming to the second issue that we want to bring to attention, also this one already illustrated several times in this classroom, concerns the topic, for years never taken into consideration, of how faithfully we describe the healthcare activity that we provide. It is called data quality and it concerns both the completeness of the information entered in the information flow and the correctness and congruence of the data in terms of exact rules and codes. This, for example, since I mentioned earlier that this is the umpteenth time that we have dealt with the topic, was the subject of an initiative by colleague Aggravi. On this last point you already know that we have been investing for some time, both through the establishment of the Information Flow Office at the Department, from 2023, and through a specific working group provided for by the health and social welfare plan and the subject of specific action also in the Annual Operational Program, i.e. the POA 2024, of the health and social welfare plan at sheet no. 20, approved with resolution no. 622/2024. The working group is addressing the qualitative issue of the flow, as well as the performance of healthcare, identifying the areas to be strengthened and proposing action to contrast it with the collaboration of the reference clinicians. Coming specifically to the questions you raised, reported in the premises of the interpellation, compared to the 23% drop, the drop, as you certainly know, was attributable to the difficulty in finding the necessary professions. Here we come to initiative no. 80 of colleague Lucianaz just now. The lack of specialist doctors, technicians and nurses affects above all outpatient services as the available human resources are obviously oriented primarily towards emergencies, then to guarantee coverage in the hospitalization departments and subsequently, with the residual resources, obviously respecting the work shifts imposed by the USL, on outpatient services. However, the increase in hiring has already made it possible to recover part of the services considered and in fact the same data for the first half of 2023, compared with 2022, recorded a +4.1%, which rises to a +7.5% if all specialist services are considered. This despite the fact that the new hires were intended to naturally and primarily recover the volumes for hospitalization activities. Specifically, the surgical activity, in 2023, exceeded that of 2019 by more than 25% and in the first months of 2024 it recorded a further +11%. Coming to the other question, on the highest worsening of waiting times, in addition to referring to data from two years ago, we inform you that the Complex Oncology and Oncological Hematology Structure of the Parini Hospital in Aosta recorded an increase in performance of 22% in 2023 and the trend is also confirmed by the partial data of this year. The Reception and Services Center (CAS) also guarantees patients rapid access to care and the first visits are guaranteed within five working days. After a decline in activity in 2020 and 2021, obviously coinciding with the pandemic, oncology activity has started to grow again since 2022, recording 861 hospitalizations with 11,456 days of decency in 2023. The trend is confirmed again this year, the numbers for the first half of 2024 are in line with those of 2023. ""The second Region with the highest percentage of private hospitalizations"". As is known, small numbers have a high variability. In fact, over the years, especially the last ones, the value has fluctuated between 02 and 05. However, Agenas constantly monitors the private institutional relationship and the data collected on regional volumes of activity and private practice. In relation to institutional activity, they have always demonstrated full respect in Valle d'Aosta for the ratios between the volumes of the two types of activity. Coming to the higher percentage of services actually provided compared to those expected, what was reported in response to the first question is partly valid, and partly the considerations that are mandatory in terms of appropriateness of the services are valid. The number of services per inhabitant is higher than average, an indicator of the existence of margins for recovery of appropriateness of prescriptions, on which we are working. Coming to the last question, that is, the discrepancy between high health expenditure and the goals achieved in terms of coverage of demand, you, colleague Guichardaz, the first thing you must consider is that it never happens, if it were not so, the thing that everyone would be telling us is that we do not put enough resources into public health. Let's instead come to the object of analysis of this data. First of all, I mentioned it a moment ago in response to colleague Lucianaz to interpellation no. 80, the problems of the public health service in Italy today are always the same three as above. Let's clear the waiting lists, because I have clearly said the above and it is not the first time I have said it. Let's stick to two dramatic issues, but on which we can try to do something: the first is the number of professionals at 360 degrees, from doctors to all the health professionals foreseen, and the second is the financing of the public health service which at this moment in Italy is the subject of a very close comparison between the central State and all the Regions, I won't explain why. In Valle d'Aosta this problem, with extreme sacrifices on everyone's part, does not exist and will not exist for the next few years, because the reference data on which we have tried to stabilize health spending in the next few years with respect to the financial coverage of the LEA, you will see it in the next budget forecast, will certainly be the subject of a more in-depth discussion in the chamber. However, it is important to say that what we have tried to do with the next budget forecast on health spending is the coverage and stabilization over the entire three-year period of the same figure with regard to the essential levels of assistance. In the current forecast, the 2024-2025-2026 one, the reference expenditure for the coverage of the essential levels of assistance in 2024 was 277 million, then 270 million in 2025 and 266 million in 2026. Even just this discrepancy between the first year of the old budget forecast compared to the second year, always of the old budget forecast, created problems, for example, for the Aosta Valley Health Authority for the preparation of its own budget forecast. Naturally in 2024 you have to make the budget forecast for 2025, in 2023 you had to do it for 2024 and so we can move forward. Having figures for the second year of the three-year period lower than those of the current year, there were always problems, so often we went in derogation with the budget forecast not allowing the Aosta Valley Health Authority to have its own budget approved on January 1st of the following year. With the stabilization that we are making of the essential levels of assistance over the entire three-year period, even increasing and that is to 278 million euros, we are in fact guaranteeing a stabilization of health coverage, so the first thing that we all have to say is that with the sacrifice of everyone, with an analysis of everyone, because these things here, I can assure you, I say them here but it is not that they give particular merit, in fact maybe tomorrow I will find letters that tell me ""but if you put the money in, why can't I make the visit in a day, two days, three days"" and so on. I say this as a common factor because that is the object of contention and they ask me about it all the time. Since we have the job of being the Administrator, therefore of making choices, including planning and strategic ones, with respect to the last question of your initiative, it is absolutely important to represent this. Naturally, the guarantee of spending on Title II on investments is also connected to all of this. I think we are one of the few local health companies to guarantee financing of 6,650,000 euros every year, so this, regardless of what would appear to be discrepancies between how much we invest and how much we get, is actually a positive thing for our health system."

Of course, it's the same data, but new ones are always added: for example, the services actually provided compared to those prescribed, I hadn't seen them in the Agenas report. This is an example. On this too, Councillor, you know very well because we were also in the majority together and we discussed it extensively, but one of the priorities that our political force put forward was the issue of the Observatory, but not because of our own punctiliousness, because every time we clash with those data and evidently, if none of us understand them, because today it's my initiative, that of Councillor Lucianaz, and so on, but in every Council it's like this, evidently there is a problem, Councillor, that you must start dealing with. Above all - I say this in every forum and in every place - we certainly cannot say that there is no money and it is also written in the premises of my interpellation, because in fact we cannot say that no money is being put into the budget. But allow me - we will come back to the next initiative of J.B. Festaz, which is perhaps even easier to understand since it is a small reality -, if we go from 2 to 5 million and if the quality of the service worsens and people leave, can we ask ourselves a question? Can we ask ourselves why, by increasing resources so much, we end up arriving at these conclusions? Evidently the results are not visible and, from this point of view, even on the waiting lists, allow me, those floating lists give hives to all those who call the CUP and tell them: ""you are placed in floating"", which means: wait, hope and you will never have the possibility of being examined. This is what people perceive. After that for you it is a sensible thing, continue to do it, but this is not how you give effective answers to people. Look, Councilor, I made a mistake, I did not send you the video I told you about yesterday, but I am sending it to you. If you tell a person who is waiting for a hernia operation when it is a high priority: ""you have to wait a year"" and then, calling a private clinic, you tell them: ""it's 6,000 euros but we can come to an agreement, maybe it's 3,000"", there is a problem here. After that, maybe you will tell me that it is a fake interview and this, in my opinion, should be reported, because, if these things come out in the newspapers and on national broadcasts, on the one hand there is still a return of image on the Aosta Valley that is not positive. I tell you this because, unfortunately, in my life I have also had people with serious disabilities next to me and even just when choosing where to go on holiday the first thing we looked at was whether it was close to a hospital and what the health system was like in that region. Those were the first choices we made to identify the region to go to on holiday. I tell you, Councilor, in my opinion, take these initiatives as initiatives that want to help in some way and certainly not always crucify the Aosta Valley health system, which we know very well makes enormous efforts."
47964,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,2,3379,"Let's talk about the family nanny service. We have learned of a note that freelance family nannies have sent to the Regional Administration, to the offices of the Regional Administration, essentially. The nannies are asking for an increase in the nannies-users ratio, which is currently one to four. They arrive at this request after a series of evaluations and comparisons with other situations. I tell you that in the Province of Trento five children are authorized, therefore one more user; in Veneto nannies are authorized to assist six children; in Valle d'Aosta four are authorized and, where there is a nanny's child over 3 years old, the fourth child is also allowed, but the service must be managed by the mother... the fifth child. Obviously it has always been a service of excellence for us, a service also developed on the territory, which has allowed the people of the Aosta Valley to live in the mountains and to have those who provided a service provided, with great professionalism, organizational skills, people with a strong sense of responsibility, whose goal was the well-being of the children. Other services similar to this one have the same objectives and perform the service in the same way. It must be said, however, that, for example, the nursery service has a user-educator or nanny ratio of one to eight, therefore significantly higher. You understand that the balance at the end of the month is completely different. Why did the nannies come to this request? Obviously because there have been a series of changes over time, for example, the early entry of small users into nursery school, therefore brought forward by months, means that small users who use the nanny service leave the service at the end of the year and the nanny goes from four users to three. If perhaps at the same time one of these children is only hired part-time, the nanny has a further hole, therefore you understand that the income is always lower. Being able to increase, at least as they underline, by one unit, if not by two, would allow the financial accounts within the service offered to be rebalanced. I believe that a further request is coming or has already arrived from the nannies, always to the offices of the Region, who ask for an adjustment of the fee that the parents of these children must pay to the family nanny service, to bring it closer to the fee that is paid for the nursery service. Obviously on one hand, with the same ISEE, a fee of 272 euros is paid and on the other 487 euros, so there is a substantial difference, beyond what is given by the Region. There is also a further request, which is the one regarding the recognition of the meal voucher, which is 1 euro. You understand, they use local products, the snack is free, the meal is given for only 1 euro, it seems a little too little for all this, to be able to continue to provide a service of this type. Unless the political choice is completely different, let's all go to work in the nursery and, since someone says it will be free, let's provide the free nursery service. However, it is a political choice that must be expressed. What is essentially being asked, Councillor, in the end, is whether you want to make an assessment and meet these requests, or whether you intend to take a different path."
47964,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,645,"Colleague Restano, I would have liked to answer you very briefly, two pages, which we were already doing, however, given the presentation of your initiative, I must tell you that you know more than me, so you will certainly also have a guarantee regarding the fact that we are not only already doing, but that there have already been discussions with the Department of Social Policies and that in the next budget the things you hope for will be included. To save time for everyone, therefore I believe that you will be absolutely satisfied with the interpellation and also with the sources that have represented you more than the relevant Councilor knows."

47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,4873,"This morning, colleagues Aggravi and Manfrin addressed the issue of the proclamation of a state of agitation with respect to the J.B. Festaz, here we are going to take a step further than the requests they brought and that is why, by mutual agreement, we had decided not to include this interpellation. As for the issue of the expansion of the Parini Hospital, I believe that the position of our regional group with respect to the issue of the J.B. Festaz is known, that is, we said we were against moving the RSA and the UAP to Variney because we were convinced that that move would have led to a worsening of the service, which then occurred, so much so that we even had to set up a commission to verify the state of the art and then because there was also an outsourcing, but on the other hand because we thought it was wrong for people with a certain amount of experience to go and occupy places in the Hospital and then be reabsorbed into the Community Hospital. Somehow, during the many questions that followed in those months of July and August of 2023, we had started to say that it seemed a bit like a shell game, where at a certain point I move the RSA to Variney and outsource, I move whoever was in the RSA to the Hospital, at this point the Community Hospital is freed up and then who knows whether either the Community Hospital or in some way the hospital department will also end up outsourcing them. This was a bit of the picture we had during that period, so we had insisted, for example, on inter-compartmental mobility, because we knew that it had already been used, as you also confirmed in several of our questions, we knew that there was the possibility, therefore, if in some way we decide to send people to the hospital, in the meantime, in our opinion, it should have been asked of all those in the nursing home, and not just a part, but even there we had been told that there was a group, this group wanted to go all together and this group wanted to return all together. This is a bit of a summary of what happened. In the meantime, the work on the community hospital has begun, in some way it is also proceeding, there has also been the addition of the water columns, as you mentioned today during the morning, so in some way we have moved forward from that point of view. Now we are almost getting to the point, because I seem to remember that in any case you said that the Community Hospital would open in 2025 and 2025 is upon us, in any case there is also a time frame in which the movement of people who are in the Hospital... must be welcomed back into the Community Hospital. With this interpellation as a first point we ask for the state of the art with respect to the opening times of the new Community Hospital and also therefore the coincidence of the end of the duration of the temporary assignment of staff, or when we intend to open the Hospital and when this staff returns to the structure of the J.B. Festaz. In the meantime however we have analyzed the various resolutions that are coming out over time and we have noticed that calls are being made - you had also mentioned it to us - for OSS or nursing staff, but in some of the premises we found something a little strange, that is, that people on the list, with reached the limits of 36 months of work, are not considered. Even though we know there are vacancies, we are moving forward, or even going to a temporary agency. The other question is therefore whether it is true that operators with 36 months at J.B. Festaz have not been hired. Already this morning, Councilor Manfrin asked about the issue of staffing, about the fact that we also saw that there was a position in the concierge service and that this was not filled by staff with limitations. You have already given an answer today, so it is up to you to repeat it or avoid it. What I am certainly saying is that, in the event that there were to be a mobility, at this point what you told me last time would completely fall through, that is, that those staff could not be recovered within the facility, because we can easily move them to the hospital. There are many places available, so just as we can easily move the staff without limitations, we can easily move the staff with limitations. Then we ask you about developments regarding the state of agitation. Today he already told us that there seems to have been no agreement, but we wanted to understand better, also because he said that he had been summoned and then did not show up, I think I understood that way. We would therefore like to understand this part better with respect to the state of agitation called by the unions."
47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,9357,"In the first instance, Mr Guichardaz, as I also said to Mr Restano a moment ago, the presentation of your interpellation - but this as usual and also giving you credit - shows that you already have much more than I can give you in terms of information, so you are absolutely asking rhetorical questions to which you already have the answers. Above all because, in reality, also with respect to questions no. 54 and no. 55 this morning, we have provided a whole series of information. I will start from the end. I did not say that I did not show up for conciliation: I said that I cannot show up for conciliation because in conciliation, at the prefecture offices, in these cases the Assessors cannot show up. Despite this, however, I met with the union representatives on October 29th in a very detailed meeting, which lasted two hours, in which I answered all the questions that were asked of me and we perceived, it is in the minutes, a satisfaction also on the part of the union representatives with respect to all the data that they requested from us, which were basically nothing other than the financial data that I represented this morning in response to no. 54 and no. 55. What financial data were I asked for? I was asked for the amount of the annual contribution for a maximum of 30% of the costs, pursuant to article 12 of no. 34/2004. I represented this morning that we went from a contribution, pursuant to article 12 of no. 34/2004, of 860,000 euros in 2018 to the current 1,600,000 euros. I was then asked what the contribution is regarding the per capita quota: it was 1,874,000 euros in 2018, it is 2,600,000 euros today, also because we went from a per capita quota of 115 euros for protected women... of 125 euros for protected women to a current per capita quota of 130 euros for protected women and 140 euros for protected women plus, so naturally it has grown. Then there are of course extraordinary contributions regarding current expenses, for example the current 750,000 euros for what concerns the contribution to contractual expenses, increasing for this sector. It has been done for other local authorities, it has also been done for the Jean Boniface Festaz. I recalled the extraordinary contribution for investments of 500,000 euros regarding the water columns, also following the inspection requested by you to go and look at the community hospital in finding this type of problems that were promptly transferred. All this means that in all respects we have gone from a transfer in favor of the Jean Boniface Festaz of 2,734,000 euros, contributions included in 2018, to the current 5,220,000 euros. If this is then transformed into minutes given to the elderly in difficulty at the Jean Boniface Festaz, to date we are record holders in this sense at a regional level, with absolute respect for the minutes for people in difficulty at this facility. Naturally, if we also transform all this into a per capita quota, also in this sense the Jean Boniface Festaz is absolutely the facility in the Aosta Valley that most respects this type of parameters. Of course, once you have done a 120-minute analysis, ... two hours compared to the current 10, you will understand that there was a possibility of going into the subject in an absolute way. Let's get to your questions, because otherwise, after I have represented everything to you for the umpteenth time in reply, you tell me that I have not answered every single question punctually. Let's therefore come to answer no. 1, which is the state of the art with respect to the opening times of the new Community Hospital. The PNRR, which financed the Community Hospital at Jean Boniface Festaz, foresees that the structure will open in the spring of 2026. Regarding the construction, we can report that the completion works relating to the entrance area and the gym are underway, while the department is already almost finished, therefore respecting the times and foreseeing the delivery and installation of all the furnishings. Coming to question no. 2 ""if it is true that the social-health workers employed for 36 months at Jean Boniface Festaz have not been hired despite the many vacant positions"": the Company reports that there are six vacant positions of social-health worker in the nursing home service with regards to the current change in the organizational chart, however it should be noted that four of these remain temporarily covered by the staff hired on a permanent basis and assigned until August 2023 to the social-health service RSA and UAP, who have not temporarily transferred to the USL Company. These four OSS staff units will be assigned to the Community Hospital when it is at Festaz. It is only at that time that the four OSS positions at the nursing home will actually become free, because to date these people are obviously working within Festaz in the other departments. To date, therefore, contrary to what was claimed, the vacancies for OSS figures are actually two and not six. It should also be specified that in the second half of 2023, the Jean Boniface Festaz Company stabilized 10 OSS with full-time and permanent contracts, drastically reducing the vacant positions which in turn are filled with fixed-term contracts. The positions temporarily covered by fixed-term staff are linked, among other things, to replacement contracts for long absences of permanent staff. It should be noted that none of the operators in question has or will reach with the existing relationships a period exceeding the 36 months of service that you mention. Having taken note of the final approval of the organizational chart, the Festaz Board of Directors has deemed it appropriate to authorize the Director to hire full-time and permanent 2 OSS, in order to fill the only two vacant positions that are currently present, as we have highlighted. Therefore, as a result of this, there will be no OSS positions not filled by permanent staff until the opening of the Community Hospital. Coming to question no. 3 ""if the vacant staff present in the organic endowment to be assigned to the operation of the Festaz has been proposed to the staff with limitations"", the Company reports that there are currently no vacant positions in the concierge service, as also referred to in the questions (points no. 54 and no. 55) this morning. Coming to question no. 4 ""the developments of the state of agitation proclaimed by all the Aosta Valley unions with the explanation of the Administration's intentions to try to re-establish a collaborative climate"", as already specified and recalled this morning when discussing the questions, the regional offices of the competent prefecture services, regarding the management of the conciliation attempt initiated by the unions against the Festaz Rest Home, have communicated that the conciliation attempt had a negative outcome following the meeting of 30 October last, where, I reiterate, the Councilors cannot participate, however they had answered all the unions' questions the day before... between the parties who can naturally present themselves. However, it is useful to highlight that the minutes reveal some positive ideas in this sense from the nursing home, which communicated that starting from 2025 it will be possible to allocate additional resources for staff replacements and also that two of the six vacant OSS positions will be stabilized shortly, thus recalling that the other four are covered by permanent staff, temporarily assigned to the nursing home and who will transfer to the Community Hospital only once it opens. It will open, was the first question, therefore from the spring of 2026, so there are 18 months to be able to make a whole series of choices. It is also useful to point out that, even with respect to the requests that came from the staff who were present in the health facility and who should then go to open up with the Community Hospital, these professional figures, therefore the OSS and the nurses, all asked together to be able to transit at the Parini - these are the resources that were used to reopen the Neurology Department, regarding the fact that we find ourselves in a difficult situation - and we had also said, in the project made at their request to all go together and to be able to return all together, that it would be a training moment for them. We can make it clear, after this happened, that both on their part the experience is so positive that they are even officially declaring the possibility of continuing to operate at the Parini, and on the part of the Parini, towards this staff, both OSS and nurses, the response was absolutely positive. Also in this sense, therefore, we do not believe we have done anything strange, but we have simply tried to find a solution that would benefit the Aosta Valley community as a whole."
47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,6,4066,"Councilor, no one says that you did not do good for the Community. What I say is that it was quite understandable, but it was already understandable when you made that draft agreement, so at that point, I repeat, it should have been asked of all the staff of J.B. Festaz. I also allow myself to say: why then does the staff of the micro, even that, not have the possibility of doing a training period in the Hospital, instead of those of Introd now having to go to Morgex and so on? Let's give everyone this great opportunity if that is the idea and I repeat, because, in my opinion, the plan was already clear from the beginning, that is, when it was decided to move the RSA Variney and outsource it, to move the staff to Neurology. Of course, as you said, in the draft agreement it was written: ""ensuring the same the necessary training, as well as gaining experience in view of subsequent employment at the community hospital"". I believe that people do not like to go back and forth like packages, this is quite evident, so it was quite normal for this to happen. From the beginning I have been saying: but why don't we do inter-compartmental mobility? Why isn't this possibility given to everyone at this point? I tell you, Councilor, we will monitor this very carefully because we have spent initiative after initiative on this and you remember it well, so much so that you spoke of feuilleton for a reason, because I have a folder of this type. From this point of view, I will bring them all out to you, because every time I have said to you: but why don't you do mobility? I have asked you a thousand times. If this mobility happens now, I tell all the OSS in the territory to do the exact same thing, because at this point, if the idea is to outsource everything that is outside to bring it to the Hospital, it can be a choice, then the possibility is given to everyone and not just to whoever you want. On the other hand, you continue to talk about money and that is right, because the money is put in by the Regional Administration, but, when we talk about funding, then we do not look at whether this funding goes through, how is the assistance, the quality and the working conditions? It seems to me a bit like saying that those who sell underwear do not know what their neighbor, who sells socks, does. This is what I seem to be saying. Also from this point of view, I, Councilor, invite you not only to say: ""we gave the money"", but whether that money goes through. From this point of view, you also said it today: you said that 60-day replacements are done differently and the people who are there are employed. I do not think it takes a scientist to understand that this brings an increase in work for the staff who are there and they are staff who already do a job that is not exactly a non-wearing job, so much so that we have been asking for all this for a long time. Maybe your numbers need to be reviewed because, from what I heard today from colleague Manfrin, an OSS must have just resigned, so most likely the numbers are still increasing. With respect to the fact that you couldn't go to conciliation, I wonder, if you couldn't go, why were you invited? That is, if someone can't, why were you invited? That is, in my opinion, you shouldn't even have been invited. This is my opinion... (intervention by Councilor Marzi off microphone) ...no, that you don't go to conciliation of course, but why were you invited? What I want to say is that if the trade unions asked you... and just look at another interesting resolution from October 2024, that is when it is essentially said that the Board of Directors does nothing other than what the Councilor tells them. So if the Councilor asks to rationalize, they rationalize. I don't know... I'll send you the letter, Councilor, so that we can discuss things in some way, but, from this point of view, most likely then you'll talk to whoever you appointed to that Board of Directors."

To be fair, I must say that the first time agri-campsites were mentioned was, I believe, in November 2022, following a question from colleagues in the Lega group, who asked what the approval timeframe was for the law on multifunctionality in agriculture. During the response of the then councilor Sapinet, agri-campsites were also mentioned, because, completing the response, he said: ""there are still some particularly important aspects relating to the performance of some types of activities not yet provided for in the current legislation, such as agri-campsites..."" and then continued with something else. The issue was then taken up again seven months later by my colleague Minelli during an interpellation, which aimed to find out, among other things, the state of the art on the reform of law no. 29, which is the law that regulates agritourism. In the introduction to the interpellation, my colleague Minelli recalled an amendment she had presented on the law, I must say famous law no. 8, which concerned the Covid period. She had inserted an amendment where she spoke of agritourism facilities that could include open spaces intended for the temporary settlement of a maximum of three tents or caravans, for a maximum of 9 guests, for which a toilet, a shower and a sink are reserved. She was basically introducing the concept of agri-camping. I also recall my position on this amendment, which was not entirely positive. Having said that, it cannot be hidden that the phenomenon of agri-camping is an evolving phenomenon, which could be well-suited to our local reality if well-coordinated and regulated. Since it is therefore growing out of all proportion in other regions, we wonder what could be done in Valle d'Aosta and what the state of the art of the law is, whether we are at a good point, whether we want to implement it, whether we want to make a separate one. Just to know what the landing point might be."

The Coordinator of the Department of Agriculture stated that paragraph 5-bis, as well as paragraph 5-ter, which were added with law no. 8/2020, do not find organic reference in the regional law on agritourism. I would also like to point out, for the sake of completeness, that as of November 4, 2024, according to what I have been told, no request for agri-camping has been received by the offices, therefore from 2020 to 2024 to date this rule has not been implemented. During 2023, the competent offices of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources worked on a regional bill on multifunctionality in agriculture, which, among other issues, rewrites the rule on the subject matter covered in this initiative of yours. The proposal of the offices, included in the draft, provides for the possibility of carrying out hospitality activities in open spaces aimed at the stay of guests in mobile setups, provided that they are not permanently anchored to the ground and have dimensional and technical characteristics that comply with the provisions in force. This regulatory text, currently still being analyzed and defined, has been included among the objectives of the DEFR 2025-2027, approved by the last Council."

47967,XVI,07/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,2,3443,"I refer to the information reported in the article in ""Aostasera"" of September 24, where we learn the following: ""The Giro d'Italia returns to Valle d'Aosta, in 2025 possible stage arrival in Val d'Ayas. According to rumors, the location in the Lower Valley should host the finale of the third-to-last stage of the Corsa Rosa. The hypothetical date is Friday, May 30"". We also report the contents of the article in ""La Vallée Notizie"" of September 28: ""The Giro d'Italia will arrive in Ayas, possible date Friday, May 30. Confirmation of the Corsa Rosa route soon"". The article in ""La Vallée"" also reports the following details and information: ""Ayas could be the location of the Aosta Valley stage of the Giro d'Italia 108, which will be presented in mid-November by RCS Sport. According to the first rumors that are leaking out, on Friday 30 May 2025 the Corsa Rosa, which will start on Saturday 10 May and end on Sunday 1 June in Rome... should be the third to last stage from Borgomanero to Ayas with the climbs of the Col d'Arlaz, the Col Zuccore and the Col de Joux in the finale. The next day, Saturday 31, the start from Brusson or Verrès, or more likely from Canavese, for Sestriere, with the Colle delle Finestre that the organizers of the ""Tour de France 2025"" also want to include and then transfer to Turin airport to reach Rome by plane for the grand finale in the capital"". : Following these articles, obviously, in the following weeks, other articles followed, which partially reported the information we have just said, others some very close dates, but different from those mentioned. We all remember well what happened to our Region during the thirteenth stage of the ""Giro d'Italia 2023"", where unfortunately the Corsa Rosa did not pass through our roads, despite the fact that the Aosta Valley, through a working table, had worked to coordinate the organizational interventions, snow removal and decorations to best welcome the runners. In those days, the following contents were reported on aostasera.it: ""Failure of the Giro d'Italia to pass, the Aosta Valley requests sporting compensation. The request in the formal letter of protest sent to the President of RCS, the CEO of RCS Sport and the Director of the Giro. Meeting in Saint-Gervais for the Tour de France on July 16th"". We also highlight what was reported in the ANSA news of June 12, 2024 in the days of the Giro ""Next Gen 2024"": ""Valle d'Aosta is aiming for a stage of the Giro d'Italia 2025"" and the Councilor reported: ""Negotiations are underway with RCS"". The competent Councilor is therefore asked to know: whether the information reported in the various articles cited above and also those that came out subsequently regarding the planning of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" and in particular regarding the part involving our Region are officially confirmed or not; how it is intended to proceed with the objective of obtaining from RCS concrete sporting compensation for Valle d'Aosta in view of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025""; whether there are any new developments or developments regarding the meeting that had been scheduled for 16 July 2023 in Saint-Gervais during the ""Tour de France"" regarding the interest of the competent Department in bringing the largest cycling race in the world back to the Aosta Valley."
47967,XVI,07/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,7385,"I will answer the first and second questions together. In the meantime, as you well know, obviously, with respect to the time of the presentation of the interpellation, there has been a postponement of the presentation of the ""Giro"", which was initially set for November 12, postponed to a date to be determined. At the moment it would seem the presentation will be in early January, but the date is not confirmed. Beyond the dates, which also emerge from the correspondence that I will read to you, I am not at this time in a position to confirm either the arrival of the stage, or the subsequent departure, as there is no confirmation of this, because the official confirmation, as communicated by RCS, will only be available on the day of the official presentation. As for contacts, as you correctly reported in the last part of your introduction, on the occasion of the Giro ""Next Gen"", we started to talk with RCS Sport, even if the contacts, in reality, continued after the... let's say the unfortunate stage of May 2023, which saw our Region completely skipped, to then resume in Switzerland and arrive in Crans-Montana. We had a series of meetings and telephone contacts, which I then followed up with a letter on September 11, 2024, this also in response to the second question on what we asked RCS in relation to the missed passage of 2023: ""I am following up on the meetings held to confirm the will of the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta to host a stage arrival and departure of the ""Giro ciclisto d'Italia 2025"", the route of which is being defined by your organizational structures. With this and in the spirit of great collaboration that has always existed between the entire Aosta Valley community and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"" I am asking you to evaluate as the main option the possibility of having the stage arrival at the Colle del Grand San Bernardo in the municipality of Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses, at an altitude of 2,473 meters above sea level, already identified as Cima Coppi in the unfortunate Borgofranco/Crans-Montana stage of the edition of the ""Giro ciclisto d'Italia 2025"". 2023"", whose passage, due to adverse weather conditions, had to be replaced with the provision of the passage of the riders inside the Gran San Bernardo Tunnel, which in turn was then definitively cancelled, with great disappointment also and above all for the great work carried out by the local communities to welcome the Giro caravan in the best possible way. The arrival of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would therefore be a fair and dutiful recognition certainly appreciated and prepared with great professionalism..."", then a series of other considerations. On September 20, I received a reply: ""We have received your letter of September 11 regarding the request to organize a stage finish at the Colle del Grand San Bernardo and we thank you for your interest in the Corsa Rosa. The proposal is certainly very fascinating, but at the same time we must take note of the logistical non-feasibility of a stage that ends at the top of the pass. The set-ups of the arrival stages of the ""Giro d'Italia"" require large spaces for the construction of the hospitality areas, the TV compound, the sponsor village and all the service structures. Several parking areas are also needed for the vehicles of the team, the organization, the media and all those who follow the ""Giro d'Italia"". While on the one hand we are unable to accommodate your request, on the other we are available to study a sports project that can enhance your Region and return the Corsa Rosa to the people of the Aosta Valley, given the historic fruitful collaboration that unites us and that led, during the current year, to the great start of the ""Giro Next Gen"" for athletes under 23. The plan for the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would foresee the last stages taking place in the north-west of the peninsula and then returning to Rome for the final stage. In this context, a stage arrival and a start the following day in your splendid Region would fit in perfectly. The two stages would be inserted, as previously mentioned, in the last weekend of the race, to be precise Friday 30 and Saturday 31 May, configuring themselves, at least on paper, as decisive stages of the Corsa Rosa"", then a series of other evaluations on the returns of the presence of the ""Giro"". The dates should therefore be confirmed because the problems - and I continually use the conditional precisely because we do not have certain news - should concern only the first week of the ""Giro"", while from the second onwards everything should be confirmed. I can therefore confirm the dates at this point. Along with the ""Giro d'Italia"" there will be a stage of the ""Giro"" for electric bikes, the ""Giro d'Italia"" with the pedal-assisted road bike is interesting and increasingly followed. It is a ""Giro"" within the ""Giro"", with teams formed by former professionals in the team and by real captains appointed to win the final classification. They are joined by VIPs, invited from stage to stage, to further ennoble a starting group of absolute value and level, not only in sports. The mileage of the individual stages is around 50 kilometers. To this must also be added the section of the stage pedaled by cyclists invited by the main sponsor Mediolanum. Also in this case at the start there will be former professionals and well-known figures from the world of entertainment and business. Associated with this we are thinking of creating a stage committee that can work for the enhancement of the stage, involving the territory and the community with, for example, among other activities, a cycle-pedaling that can involve all the actors of the professions related to the world of the mountains. As for the third question, as you reported, there had been a contact to have a meeting on July 16, 2023, through the Mayor of Saint-Gervais, with the general director of the Tour, Christian Prudhomme. The assessment made after appropriate checks highlighted that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to be able to communicate with the management of the Tour during the very hot days of the race, risking having little attention and jeopardizing the validity of the project itself, filed in Paris in 2019, called ""Tour du Mont Blanc"", which involved the Haute-Savoie, Valais and Valle d'Aosta in a triptych of stages. One of the hypotheses at the stage level included the departure from Bourg-Saint-Maurice, the entry into Valle d'Aosta from the Colle del Piccolo San Bernardo and the arrival in Pila. It was therefore decided to postpone in view of more appropriate situations, dedicating time and resources to first of all bring the ""Giro d'Italia"" back to the roads of our Region, also because, making the parallel with the stages organized by some Regions of the North, therefore Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Piedmont, in the great start of the ""Tour de France 2024"", which involved these regions with three stages and a start on the fourth day, the cost that was communicated to us by short means amounts to approximately 7 million euros. Today therefore these are resources that would not be available for an activity of this kind."
47967,XVI,07/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,4096,"I listened carefully to the Councilor's response regarding this long-awaited stage, but let's say stages that will be in 2025, but above all long-awaited by the people of the Aosta Valley after what happened in 2023. Obviously you cannot bypass the institutional steps that must be taken by the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", so you gave us some information to clarify a little what was reported in the newspapers. We understand that the precise details cannot yet be revealed at this time. What you said well and that is right that it is then reported in the media is that the precise dates will be the 30th and 31st. We said this because we learned from the newspapers on the date of October 28th, in ANSA news it was reported - I think from a press release from the Regional Council - that you confirmed the two stages and the dates of May 29th and 30th had been written. On the same day, ""Aosta News"", which always took its cue from this press conference, reported the 30th and 31st. It is therefore also right to specify these dates so that things are clearly understood. These dates are certainly very positive because, as we all know, the end of the ""Giro d'Italia""... will then be the decisive days for the general classification and therefore, in terms of spectacle, it will be a great sporting and technical spectacle in our region. We hope that, as has been reported in the newspapers, highly technical routes will be identified, because our roads are such anyway. In the second stage, assuming these locations that have been described unofficially in the media, therefore with a possible arrival in Val d'Ayas and a restart in the valley floor, which could be Verrès, we hope that the restart could perhaps include a route that does not start immediately from Verrès towards the valley floor, to try to better enhance our region, our roads and above all all the excellences of the Aosta Valley. We are certain that the arrival of that stage, that is, the previous day... which will arrive inside the Aosta Valley and then go to the Ayas Valley... that stretch will already be covered, so replicating it in the exit would be a bit of a duplication in terms of international showcase. This is a passage, then we know that it is not easy to be able to do what you want, but surely, if you lay good foundations, or give suggestions, maybe in time you can do things as one hopes. The other issue: you spoke of committee initiatives to best enhance our territory. We share this aspect a lot, they are fundamental, in fact we thank in advance all the volunteers, associations, Administrators who will work to better enhance the passage of these athletes of the caravan, because, as I said, events like the ""Giro d'Italia"" have great visibility and therefore we must seize these opportunities in the best possible way. Here too, you probably cannot reveal more details to us. We hope that in the discussions that have taken place between the Department and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", always referring to what happened in 2023, there has been the possibility of putting together a media plan that is as rich as possible in terms of promoting everything that is our Region from a historical, cultural and naturalistic point of view. We all know that, when there will be a live broadcast, that is, the decisive phases of the ""Giro d'Italia"" that will arrive in our region, therefore with a live broadcast that goes worldwide, if we manage to transmit as much as possible everything that is part of the Valle d'Aosta system, it will be a great result for everyone. We therefore hope that this work has been done and that on the other side RCS has taken these ideas, but above all... we repeat again... how can we say it? has put in the maximum effort to give this great result, remembering what happened in 2023."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,2,2962,"Let's go back to talking about commerce in this Assise, about small commercial activities, which are increasingly being absorbed by large-scale distribution. There have been rumors for quite some time now, in Verrès, about the possible relocation of a well-known supermarket in the Lower Valley, which I will not name. This possible relocation to a more strategic area has triggered a heated debate among local traders, who express significant concerns about the impact that this reality could have on their businesses, already tested by the economic crisis, the high cost of living and, in particular, by the phenomenon that persists throughout the territory, both nationally and in the Aosta Valley: that of commercial desertification. The fear of traders is evident, the relocation and possibly its expansion could further intercept potential customers, thus eroding the shares of small shops already put at risk, precisely as I said before, by the phenomenon of commercial desertification. I would also like to point out that concentrating spending in a single point of sale could alter the face of the historic center of Verrès and thus reduce the wealth that circulates within the Community, with negative repercussions on the local economy, a concern that, in our opinion, is more than understandable. I reiterate that we, as an opposition group, will always try to find concrete solutions to strengthen the economic and social fabric of the Aosta Valley. Allow me at this point to point out that the commercial landscape is constantly evolving: on the one hand, large-scale distribution, which, in our opinion, must absolutely be regulated, and on the other, small neighborhood businesses, two different retail models with their own strengths and weaknesses. Large-scale distribution offers a wide choice of products, competitive prices, convenience, but at the same time has disadvantages, such as perhaps the lack of customization, environmental impact and less attention to quality. On the other hand, small neighborhood businesses offer a more personalized and, if I may, even a little more human shopping experience, quality products and, above all, they contribute to keeping our villages and towns alive. It is clear that these businesses also present significant challenges, higher costs, a more limited offer and, consequently, the difficulty of competing with large-scale distribution. Having highlighted these differences between the two businesses that constitute the commerce sector, let us now move on to the purpose of this initiative. The undersigned calls upon the competent Councilor to find out whether this information is true and, if so, what strategies are intended to be implemented to protect commercial businesses that risk being swallowed up by large-scale distribution."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,6524,"With reference to the first question regarding the news of a possible inclusion of a supermarket in the former Vuillermin Marmi area, in the municipality of Verrès, I would like to point out that in this regard there are no communications of any kind in the files of the Department. The Municipal Administration of Verrès, which we consulted on the matter, also informs that to date the Municipality has not filed any building application for the construction of a new commercial building on the lot of the former Vuillermin area. The only building permit relating to this area, filed in 2024, in fact concerns a remediation intervention of the asbestos roofing of the existing warehouses. At present there are therefore no elements that allow us to confirm or deny the news. I could also end it here, because the Municipality has correctly responded on the basis of the documents it currently has available, but I think it is more correct to give an answer, because the ""it is said"", the ""it is heard""... There are some things that are in progress, not formalized, for which I allowed myself to hear the proposer of the initiative, who represented to me that at the moment the intervention concerns, as I told you, the removal of asbestos sheets on three warehouses forming a single body, located a short distance in particular from the school complex and the micro-community for the elderly, a removal intervention that therefore I believe is to the advantage of the community. A new request for building intervention will then be presented for a total redevelopment of the area, with the drafting of the PUD, as provided for by the general municipal regulatory plan, with the aim of transferring the current medium-sized sales structure activity? you didn't mention it, so I won't mention it either? currently located in the same municipality, a short distance away. The new structure would not accommodate new types of goods, therefore no restaurant, no hamburger joint, no parapharmacy, as is obviously heard from the rumours in the village, nor larger surfaces than the current ones, except for a new fishmonger's department in the spaces needed to guarantee a quality service for a business not present in the municipality of Verrès, nor in the neighbouring municipalities. As for the structure currently occupied by the sales structure in question? I believe that this is also part of the reorganisation?, the intention of the promoter of the initiative would be to place a non-food product there that is not present in the area. With regard to the second question, namely ""what strategies do you intend to implement to protect the local commercial activities that are facing competition from large-scale distribution"", we reiterate that the Regional Administration is fully aware of the importance of the widespread presence of commercial activities in the area since commercial activities preside over and keep our communities alive and provide essential services for residents and tourists who visit our region. One could therefore imagine protecting local businesses by introducing restrictions on the establishment of specific categories of production and commercial activities, perhaps on the basis of product or size criteria. However, this path - and my colleague Ganis knows this very well - is not viable because no regional intervention can ignore the principles of protection of competition, freedom of establishment and the free provision of services. Principles that, in application of the Bolkestein directive, prevail in most cases. In this regard, I recall that in 2013 there was this article 1 bis, which we refer to in all inspection activities and which therefore I do not want to repeat, because it is perfectly known. In its current formulation, therefore, the regional law on trade, taking into account the specific territorial characteristics of the Aosta Valley, establishes that free access and the exercise of commercial activities can be limited only when the objective is to protect health, workers, cultural heritage and the environment. The Department is now defining a new update and refinement of regional law no. 12/1999 to pursue the best possible balance between the constraints of compliance with the principles of protection of competition, freedom of establishment and the free provision of services set by European and national legislation and the needs of protection of the territory in a broad sense. Furthermore, regional legislation values ​​small commercial entities in accordance with the principles of the Landscape Territorial Plan, with a view to protecting mountain settlements and small nuclei. This enhancement is implemented through urban planning choices that are essentially the responsibility of municipal administrations. In fact, even if the municipal general regulatory plan is subject to verification of subjection to strategic environmental assessment, the government of the municipal territory is and remains the prerogative of the Municipality and, in the absence of imperative reasons of general interest, which I listed a moment ago, there are no tools that allow the Region to prevent a local authority from allocating an area of ​​its territory to the establishment of a medium or large sales structure. Therefore, since it cannot in most cases select or limit commercial activities on the basis of the size of the sales spaces or the types of goods or services offered, the Region intervenes with incentives to support commercial activities considered important to ensure balanced development of the territory. This is what we are doing with contributions in favor of neighborhood businesses and with subsidized loans for investments or for the creation of liquidity, provided for by regional law no. 19/2001, with which the Region supports investments for the opening and renovation of commercial businesses. I close by saying that there are further support initiatives, in addition to those I have just mentioned, that are being studied also in favor of commercial activities, in particular, a bill to support energy efficiency and innovation of tourist-receptive and commercial activities is currently being prepared... more of a study than a preparation, with resources already included in the 2025 budget."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,6,1485,"I thank the Councilor for the response and for his attention to a sector, that of commerce, which is a sector in particular difficulty. I thank you again for having examined this issue in greater depth. Personally, I have done nothing other than bring to the attention of this Council, that is, I have done my job, the concerns of many traders and also those of neighboring countries, who do not look favorably on this possible move. Furthermore, it is one thing to take into account a move, excuse me; on the other hand, it is a move with an annexed expansion of the sales area, which will not happen, as you have clearly highlighted. At this point, however, politics comes into play, because there are two ways: either focus on large shopping centers, or make the most of our small commercial and neighborhood businesses. I therefore close, I have already mentioned it several times, because the law on commerce, which is particularly dated, antiquated, should be updated. We have said it many times, we have been saying it for years, also taking into account all these problems that we are experiencing at the moment, that twenty years ago did not exist, therefore e-commerce, large-scale distribution and the economic crisis. We, as a group, will continue to monitor and bring the requests of the traders to this Council. I hope that today ? and I do not know until when ? the traders of Verrès can still rest easy and sleep soundly."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,2,3639,"Today, however, I would like to draw your attention to a topic of fundamental importance, which is the question of the cost of living, a topic of great current interest and concern for the citizens of the Aosta Valley. The high cost of goods and services compared to other Italian cities significantly affects the quality of life and the economic well-being of the Aosta Valley population. Allow me to bring to the table an article that appeared in a well-known newspaper, whose name I will not reveal: ""From a survey by Codacons (Coordination of associations for the defense of the environment and the rights of users and consumers), in 2024 Aosta is the Italian city where living costs the most, while Naples is the cheapest. It is best to do food shopping in Catanzaro, while Bolzano boasts the most expensive food and drink trolley. Goods and services also have higher costs, for a total of 573 euros. Comparing the most expensive city and the cheapest, it turns out that in Aosta the average cost of living is around 57% more than in the Campania capital"". Returning to our beloved Region, the causes of the high cost of living that contribute to the increase in prices are many: the geographical position, being a mountain city, the costs of transport and distribution of goods are higher than in flatter areas; the seasonality linked to tourism; the local economy strongly linked to tourism, especially winter tourism, so the high demand in certain periods of the year can increase prices; the higher cost of living, so salaries and pensions are not always able to compensate for the increase in prices; we also have the problem of limited supply, so the presence of a small market can limit competition, favoring the maintenance of higher prices. All this, allow me, generates a negative impact on the lives of the citizens of the Aosta Valley, hitting precisely the most vulnerable groups. Many families struggle to make ends meet and are forced to give up essential goods and services. The increase in prices erodes the purchasing power of citizens, limiting the possibility of consumption and, finally, the high cost of living could push more people to leave our Region in search of more favorable economic conditions, therefore also in defiance of the policies to combat the phenomenon of depopulation of internal areas and mountainous zones. Considering that this issue is also very much felt at a national level, many organizations and institutions are involved in monitoring and managing this phenomenon. I remember that at a national level, Istat, the Government, the AGCM, which is the Authority for Market Competition, the UNC (National Consumer Union), are involved, which have the task, precisely, of monitoring the trend of prices and intervening in the event of anomalies or speculation. Therefore, if on the one hand these organizations and institutions can contribute to protecting consumers, on the other hand it is necessary to implement a policy of support and assistance to Aosta Valley families in difficulty. Based on these considerations, our group asks the competent Councillor to find out which retail price monitoring tools are currently in use and whether the Council intends to engage in dialogue with the most representative trade associations and representatives of the distribution sector in order to explore solutions that can promote greater transparency and competitiveness in prices, such as the promotion of sustainable commercial practices."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,5909,"With regard to the first question, the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, as part of the initiatives undertaken to defend the purchasing power of families, as you highlighted in your illustration, has activated through the action of the Guarantor for the surveillance of prices, also known as ""mister prezzi"", a supply chain monitoring project that, to date, relies on statistical information coming monthly from the markets at origin through the Institute of Services for the Agricultural Food Market, at wholesale through the Italian Telematic Commodity Exchange of the Chambers of Commerce system and at consumption through the National Institute of Statistics. The information collected, which also concerns the monthly price levels of consumer goods and services in the Aosta Valley, can be consulted on the website of the Price and Tariff Observatory of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy. The same website also publishes analyses and in-depth analyses on price trends. Last June 27, with the signing of a protocol between the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, the Ministry of the Interior and Unioncamere, an experimental monitoring project of the consumer prices of some food and agri-food products sold in the main retail markets, in the regional capitals or autonomous provinces, was included in this system of detection and sharing of information. The project is aimed at experimenting with a new method of monitoring prices, with particular reference to agri-food products sold in local markets and in the regional and autonomous province capitals and has the objective of strengthening the surveys at territorial level and the level of analysis of consumer prices on the basis of detailed investigation plans and through interaction with users. The project also includes the activation, by the prefectures, of specific observatories, which will see the participation of a plurality of stakeholders, including consumer associations registered in the list referred to in Article 137 of the Consumer Code. In particular, the protocol of 27 June 2024 provides that consumer associations, in addition to the aforementioned observatories, are also involved, through the Directorate General for Consumers and Market of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, in the implementation phases of the initiative on the territory, contributing to the collection in the markets of information and price data necessary for the implementation of the protocol. To this end, the Ministry of Business has published two notices: a first notice that was rejected on 18 September and a second notice, on 26 September, to collect expressions of interest from consumer associations registered in the list referred to in Article 137 to participate in the price collection. The entities thus identified upload the price data collected on the territory into a software made available by the Ministry itself, which forwards the data to the Guarantor for Price Surveillance. The observatories are currently being activated in the various provincial capitals. The observatories are assigned the task of monitoring the trend of consumer prices in the identified sectors, of analyzing any problems and of making reports to the Guarantor for Price Surveillance. The Observatory meets at least once every two months and at the same time draws up a report on the trend of consumer prices to be sent to the Guarantor for price surveillance. The Special Observatory in Italy is based at the Prefectures and the Regions are not part of it, even if evidently in the case of our Region there is participation in the prefectural activities on the basis of the protocol signed by the Ministry of the Interior. In Valle d'Aosta, as in many Regions and Provinces, this Special Observatory was established at the Prefecture and the survey activities have been started with reference to two local markets in Aosta. The data collected will be sent directly to the Ministry via the Chambre Valdôtaine. As regards the second question, obviously we return to the point that we have already somehow dealt with in the previous interpellation. I would like to say that the activation of the Price Observatory in the Aosta Valley will constitute a new and additional venue in which the dialogue with the various stakeholders in the distribution and consumer sectors will be strengthened and institutionalized, with meetings at scheduled intervals, according to the methods just illustrated. The purpose, as mentioned, is precisely that desired in the question you asked, that is, to promote greater transparency and competitiveness of prices and in this regard the Department has asked to be able to acquire the reports and any relevant documents that will emerge also for subsequent assessments for the purposes of changes to the rules on trade. I will not repeat the issue of local businesses, because we know it by now. Within the framework of the regulatory framework currently in force, the Department grants contributions in favor of local businesses to mortgages in order to support competitiveness in the distribution sector, as well as to protect consumers and guarantee them a widespread service throughout the territory, as well as other initiatives under consideration such as those I illustrated in the previous answer. In conclusion, the Department supports the initiative in favor of consumers also through the granting of contributions to consumer associations both with funds from the regional budget, pursuant to regional law no. 6/2004, and through the participation of the Department in ministerial calls for tenders annually intended for the same purposes."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,6,2064,"Thank you Councilor for your reply. I welcome the Councilor's commitment to intervene with measures aimed precisely at reducing the cost of basic necessities. You also told me about these projects that are being implemented: in Valle d'Aosta we have this special Observatory, we hope they do something. What I want to tell you is that every day, unfortunately, we hear stories of families forced to give up - I'll get to the heart of the initiative - essential goods and also of young people who leave our valley. Many elderly people, after a life dedicated to work, struggle to meet expenses, even basic ones. I therefore believe that we cannot remain inert in the face of the difficulties of our fellow citizens, so it is our duty to seek all possible ways to guarantee them a dignified life. For this reason, we must implement all possible solutions, even by revisiting policies that may have been implemented, therefore, to address the high cost of living in our region, it is necessary to involve institutions, associations, businesses and citizens. Now I come to the heart of my initiative. Allow me to point out some solutions. You mentioned a couple, I will tell you others, in my opinion, important, always with a view to effective collaboration: incentivizing local production, implementing collaboration between consumer associations, giving support to local businesses, but also introducing maximum price caps for some basic necessities. In all of this, however, we have an important and fundamental role in combating the high cost of living through fiscal policies, investments in infrastructure and support for families. We talked about it in the other Council, where we also talked about vouchers for families in difficulty. Therefore, solving the problem of the high cost of living is a complex process, it takes time, but through a joint commitment it is possible to improve and guarantee greater social equity."

We all know that the bill: ""Provisions on public safety, protection of personnel in service, as well as victims of usury and the prison system"" has been approved in the Chamber. This bill is now in the Senate. We highlight that in the 38 articles of the ""Security"" bill there are 13 new types of crime, plus various aggravating circumstances, including: article 10, which provides for imprisonment of up to one month for blocking a road or railway committed by an individual and from six months to two years if the crime is committed by several people together; article 15, which opens the possibility of prison also to pregnant women and mothers, and to newborns; English: Article 19, relating to crimes of violence or threat and resistance to a public official, with the aggravating circumstance provided for if the act is committed to prevent the construction of a public work or a strategic infrastructure, such as, for example, the bridge over the Strait or the Turin/Lyon railway line; Article 28, which authorizes public security agents to carry certain types of firearms without a license; Article 32, which provides for the closure of businesses for 5 to 30 days for shopkeepers who sell SIM cards without identifying customers and so on. With all these new rules inserted, the Government has decided to want to manage numerous social issues, in our opinion, in the most illiberal way possible, that is, by repressing with the use of the penal system of prison, rather than opening up to dialogue and listening, while intervening to alleviate the problems that afflict citizens, which is what we would expect from a democracy. For us, balancing security measures with the protection of individual freedoms is important and for this reason we recall the principle that security policies should in no case compromise the fundamental rights of citizens, such as privacy, freedom of movement and expression. In this sense, there is already an initial response to what colleague Manfrin was saying today, because this flyer was on the union noticeboard, in my opinion, rightly so, because even the workers' right to demonstrate is affected in some way. I highlight this because it seems to me that, from what he said, then I did not check on the union noticeboard, but it is not that all the initiatives are there... evidently there are initiatives that are more dedicated in some way to workers. I have not analyzed with the attention that my colleague has given to the issue of the noticeboard, but an initial response, in my opinion, is there. A right, which is the right to demonstrate, is currently being somewhat limited by the ""Safety"" decree, so I think it is important for workers to know that demonstrating can become a crime against them. We also believe it is important to provide for monitoring and transparency mechanisms for the new measures so that their application can be controlled and that they do not lend themselves in some way to abuse. Democratic control is essential to prevent the tightening of safety regulations from being used disproportionately. This is why the challenge is very simple. In the meantime, we will understand what our colleagues think, many of us participated in those demonstrations, they also authenticated signatures, so, from a certain point of view, they have also taken action on this issue and what we would like to somehow bring out is what the Chamber thinks, certainly having some certainties with respect to the person in front of me, because I can already imagine what they will say. The commitment, however, is to activate the regional government, to take action towards the Aosta Valley parliamentarians so that the national government and the Parliament are asked to remove this bill, which for us is in some way also an attack on democratic principles that we believe to be important. As I was saying, I can already imagine what some people will say, but this is our thought and therefore we also wanted to submit to the Chamber and understand what our colleagues think about it. It is noted that from 7:41 p.m. President Bertin resumes the presidency."

I definitely, personally, do not approve of this bill. There is no doubt about that. But where am I going to get lost here? On the commitment. The commitment of this motion has ended, it can no longer be done, it is in the past. The Deputy has already voted. It was necessary to ask the Senator, who we know very well... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...but they will be the ones who will have to tell him. Therefore on this motion... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...there is not even suspense, dear Councilor, because it is clear, it has passed. This motion must be withdrawn. I mean, they have already played the tune, now what do we do? Are we going to make ourselves laugh at? Because if we present something like this, we will make ourselves laugh at. What do they tell us? They tell us that you voted in the Chamber, we are waiting for the Senate... and the Senator is clearly aligned. Therefore, this is a motion that, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Movement that I represent, should be withdrawn."

This is a question of institutional courtesy, because, from a certain point of view, we have two Members of Parliament. After that, I imagine that the Member of Parliament also has contacts with Senators, right? Let's hope at least that in some way he not only works with the Senator, but also works in other ways. This is to be hoped for, that he is not there alone and scattered. What we are therefore asking in some way is that he also take action to ask for the deletion, that is, from this point of view, I believe that he can do it very well regardless of what he voted or did not vote for, whether he has already voted, and so on. Taking action to ask for the deletion is something he can very well do. From this point of view, therefore... if you then want to amend and write that we are only asking the Senator and you want to do this, however, it would be important to understand what your position is, which cannot hide behind, sincerely, these reasons that we have heard at this moment."

I would make a proposal: either withdraw the motion and, as forces opposed to the provisions of the bill, perhaps, I don't know, present a national legislative initiative in the Council that seeks to repeal a law approved by the State and therefore the Left forces are united and present... or there could actually be a modification to the commitment where the writing is proposed, obviously there will not be a vote in favor from our group, I'm saying it already, we will abstain, or present the initiative so that someone, who in this case is the Government, writes a legislative text of council initiative, perhaps by the pen of a Councilor of the majority, certainly very expert in this... to present a legislative bill of council initiative towards the Italian State, which seeks to repeal this type of commitment.

You cannot intervene by blocking people! Because otherwise everyone here invents a motion and while you are speaking, since I invent something, you interrupt me or I interrupt you.

This is a resolution of the Rules of Procedure Committee of 2000, which means that the rationale of the rule is that the point of order interrupts the speech.

The so-called ""security decree"", which some have rightly renamed ""repression decree"", is a liberticidal law, which brandishes the Penal Code against unions, students and all those who want to express their dissent even in a non-violent way, a decree that responds to the problems and social injustices of our country by increasing penalties, disregarding our Constitution. These rules, in addition to not solving the problems, aggravating the work of the police forces and clogging up the courts even more, will only worsen the current situation, creating a climate of greater insecurity among citizens.

As for the merits, we would like to make some considerations on this decree. We believe that the ""Security"" decree corresponds to the needs of the country to guarantee respectful coexistence between citizens. I have listened carefully to positions that are legitimate, but that we do not share at all and that are distant from our way of seeing the organization of society. Saying that we need to work on the education of citizens who live in hardship or who have problems is a fine declaration of intent, in two or three generations we will see the results. In the meantime we find citizens, according to what you say, who can afford to illegally occupy a property, someone else's private property and should not be punished. There are citizens who can demonstrate in the middle of a highway, who can block the country, who can block railway lines, who can block transport. In your opinion, does this mean demonstrating? Democratic demonstrations are done in a different way because of our way of interpreting the organization and democratic life of a country. It seems to us that, in this respect, there was a need to intervene, because we must also be respectful of the freedom of others. It is not that because I claim a right, my freedom, I can undermine the overall organization of society. There are ways to express one's principles, one's voice and one's ideas, in our opinion, in a very different way from those we have heard represented. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we are deeply convinced that we need a little more security in this country, that we need conditions that guarantee the conditions for everyone to live peacefully. In our way of seeing and interpreting the institutional organization, we cannot allow the lives of others to be undermined.

I therefore referred to the facts that undermine the honorability of a Councilor. Having been the recipients of some invitations, I thought it was important, given that the person responsible for it was the first to point the tip, the lighthouse, the finger at other people, to point out this passage, but we will talk about this, since the recordings are there, so we will have the opportunity to talk about this later, don't worry. As for the merit of the initiative, I would like to thank my colleagues in a very calm manner, because I believe it is indeed an important topic, on which the discussion allows us to express our thoughts and allows us to express them in a way that is in any case different between us and you, who proposed it, and we appreciated, I personally also appreciated the calm tones with which you rightly expressed your opposition. I appreciated it a little less, but that's part of the game... and I understand the rather agitated intervention of those who, unfortunately, are gagged so as never to be able to speak, especially when there are issues that concern something they would like to have a say on, so as not to have their last remaining voter stolen from them, by the very two colleagues who proposed this initiative and instead are always forced into silence... in fact I saw some colleagues with particularly dark faces, while the colleague who intervened with this vehemence was throwing out weeks and weeks of brooding, of unexpressed words. To get to the merits of the initiative, let's say that even with respect to what has been said, colleague Guichardaz, certainly, when you intervene on the merits of demonstrations, you limit the right to demonstrate, but let's not forget that the right to express one's dissent is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is clear that I cannot do it in the ways I like best, but I have to follow certain rules. Obviously the Constitution also provides for the application of the rules for demonstrations. For demonstrations, it has already been said, but I think it is important, a stop has been put to some methods that objectively had proven to be particularly wrong to express one's thoughts. I believe that there is no problem, and there never has been, in organizing initiatives, public meetings, parades, marches. We have also seen it here in Valle d'Aosta, several have been done and, when they are peaceful, they do not create any problems. It is different when these then intervene and perhaps suspend a public service or create an obstacle. We have all seen, for example, the famous initiatives that have become quite famous throughout the world... in one part of the world, in the Western world, the one that allows you to do it because in others they are not allowed. I don't know, those who demonstrate for the climate, I don't know if they are all called ""Fridays for future"" or have different acronyms. The traffic block that is being implemented obviously has some big problems: if I block traffic, I don't just block the person who is going to the cinema, I block the person who is going to work and perhaps risks being fired, I block the ambulance with a person on board who risks dying, I block a series of connections that certainly do not help attract attention, indeed they are even counterproductive for two reasons: first, people who remain stuck in traffic are certainly not happy and certainly do not get passionate about the issue; secondly, cars stuck in traffic certainly produce much more CO2 by remaining stuck there, certainly those are not the methods. I have heard of the crime of riot and the ""anti-Gandhi law"", which however has actually been used incorrectly because this type of crime was introduced for prison inmates and this law provides that ""anyone inside the prison who participates in a riot through acts of violence or threats or resistance to the execution of orders given committed by three or more people gathered together is punished with imprisonment from 1 to 5 years"". Acts of resistance are also passive resistance behaviors: imagine, for example, the walks and the prisoners who refuse to return to their cells as a protest when they have to go back. We have clearly seen acts of protest of that type. Prisoners clearly have all the rights, they have lawyers who visit them in prison, they can demonstrate what they want, there are methods in those facilities that are not good and these methods, this same type of situation is foreseen for the detention and reception centers of migrants. It is not therefore for all demonstrations, but for some typologies. Then we talked about detained mothers with children. We addressed a problem that unfortunately was a serious problem, because there was a reiteration of crimes by mothers, who in reality hid behind their children to avoid ending up behind bars and who used this as an excuse to continue to pickpocket. Perhaps in our reality we notice it less, but in the situations that have subways or trains, unfortunately, this is a reality that is very present and has become a plague. I think that anyone who watches the news can notice it. Clearly here we are not talking about taking and throwing people behind bars, but, since here the sentence provides for a postponement, in that case the execution of the sentence will not be postponable, not always, but ""if the judge identifies the risk that further crimes could be committed and it can take place in an institute with attenuated custody for detained mothers"". Penalties are also being increased for those who employ minors for begging and the maximum penalty goes from 3 to 5 years. Again: cannabis was mentioned. This Government has said it from the beginning: we are evidently against the use of drugs, whether soft or hard, we rightly do not make this type of distinction. I honestly have only one thing to say: I feel very sorry for those who, to get through their day, find their personal relaxation or outlet in ""sniffing"" a bit of drugs. I feel very sorry for them and, honestly, I think that there are different ways, different ways of being able to live one's life and also of being able to find a moment of leisure and relaxation. What was said about the sentences is indeed true, but the Government, obviously, from this point of view, will continue to move forward. Again: we talked about the demonstrations and the sit-ins. There will be a blockade, as we said, not only on the road but also on the tracks, because unfortunately one person on a track is enough to completely block a train and a connection. We realize what can obviously happen. What has been said... the aggravating circumstance of dissent on works of great importance has unfortunately become necessary because, for large works that are indispensable for our country, such as the TAV, unfortunately it has come to urban warfare in order to defend a work that is truly indispensable and to connect Corridor 5, which unfortunately is a necessity. Moreover, for example, the Democratic Party has never denied this position and the need to build this work when it was in government. I believe that this was a necessity for everyone, not just for one political party. Furthermore: the penalties for damages in demonstrations have been increased. Indeed, demonstrating peacefully is not only permitted, but is encouraged. It is right to demonstrate and I much prefer those who demonstrate, who expose themselves, who show that they do not agree in an absolutely peaceful way compared to those who perhaps disguise themselves and go and smash shop windows, go and smash cars and perhaps smash the cars of some poor guy who has to wake up and go to work that day, who has absolutely nothing to do with it, but, ""since I have to demonstrate, I smash everything"". We remember the interview with that boy who said: ""Well, if you don't smash things at demonstrations... that is, a mess!"". Those people unfortunately must be punished and deserve to be punished, it is quite obvious. Again: there is an extension of the urban DASPO. We also believe this is a useful measure to be able to restore some order in those cities that are certainly today, unfortunately, also prey to petty crime, which is defined as micro, but which in reality the people who live those realities feel in an important way on their own skin. In the manifesto, in the flyer that was then put on the union noticeboard, it was said that migrants are being blamed. You also said it, colleague Guichardaz, in your speech. Why? Because it simply inserts a common sense rule, that is, it is not that we are blaming someone, it simply creates the situation whereby, in the event that companies were to sell SIM cards without observing the identification obligations for customers, the sanction of closing the business or activity for a period of 5 to 30 days is applied. It is clear that SIM cards cannot be sold to people who do not even have a regular residence permit, people of this type are in theory illegal immigrants and should not be in this country. Eventually, we know, you know better than us and you also know very well the associations that defend them, they have every right to go and ask for the right to asylum, they can do it and, if the right to asylum is denied, evidently they do not have the right to be here. If they do not have the right to be here, why should they be able to have a SIM? To be here illegally, perhaps to commit crimes? Because in theory, if they are not here legally, they cannot work, they cannot have a contract. How do they earn a living? I think these are questions that everyone should ask themselves, but common sense. I do not think there are security issues, as has been said. Arbitrary occupation crime. This has not been discussed, but it is important. The part of illegal occupation of housing has become a truly important situation and we are also suffering from some of it. Councilor Marzi knows it... I imagine Councilor Sapinet also knows it by virtue of their occupation of the residential building part, there are people who have unfortunately occupied housing illegally, even council houses, and unfortunately send them away... not those who cannot pay because they cannot afford it, but those who occupy these houses because they do not have the possibility of finding another, but they clearly abuse a right... it is obvious that they absolutely must be evicted. In fact, the crime is introduced because ""anyone who occupies and holds without title a property intended for someone else's domicile or prevents access to it by the legitimate owner is punished with a sentence of 2 to 7 years. The rule? this is a great novelty? also applies to appurtenances such as garages, courtyards, balconies, terraces. The same fate for anyone who interferes or cooperates in the occupation of the property, or receives or pays money or other benefits for the occupation itself"". The plague that exists in other areas of occupying public housing through third parties by renting it. Again: an aggravating circumstance for crimes in stations and in the subway, we said it before, that we do not hear but that are absolutely present. Then a whole section on the modification of the Anti-Mafia Code to make it more effective. Simply put, the interruption of benefits to relatives of mafiosi... if they interrupt relations with the relative who, in fact, has been arrested, or is a subject subject to preventive measures or subjected to a related criminal proceeding. Again - this is a rule on which we have really focused a lot -: the revocation of citizenship if there is a conviction for terrorism or serious crimes. ""The term for being able to adopt the measure to revoke citizenship for crimes of terrorism and subversion and other serious crimes is extended from 3 to 10 years and from the passage into res judicata to the final conviction sentence. It is not possible to proceed with the revocation of citizenship if the interested party does not possess or cannot acquire another"". Finally, the crime of possession of material for terrorist purposes: ""Anyone who, outside of cases of association for terrorist purposes and training for terrorist activities, knowingly obtains or possesses instructions for committing acts of terrorism, dissemination and instruction on the preparation and use of explosive or toxic substances for the purpose of committing crimes against State officials, will be punished with imprisonment from 2 to 6 years"". We believe that these are common sense choices. On this and on security, the League has evidently made very strong choices, choices that were in the government programs, choices that we have claimed and choices that are absolutely compatible, obviously they will be once approved in the Senate. Earlier, jokingly, I said to my colleague Di Marco who was speaking that it was not known whether my colleague Spelgatti would vote for the measure in the Senate. I have not consulted with her, obviously, for this initiative, but I can say with reasonable confidence that I will not be contradicted, that obviously Senator Spelgatti will vote for this measure. She will vote for it and apply it as is right, because evidently, just as we have suffered, unfortunately, in years of Governments that tended to see little alternation, saw a prevalence of the Democratic Party, which managed to govern even when it lost the elections, for once we have an elected Government that has obviously gathered consensus on a program and on this, evidently, will carry forward what it promised to do. Rightfully, regardless of the feasibility or non-feasibility of the motion, I would like to thank my colleagues for having presented it and allowed us to express ourselves and obviously I announce that, if the motion is not withdrawn, the Lega group will vote against it."

It is quite obvious that in any case I do not recognize myself, we do not recognize ourselves in the least in those who, in the name of Moloch, must demonstrate at all costs and with all means, impede the normal activity of a company. We do not recognize ourselves. They are visions, we respect the different position, but we do not recognize ourselves in the least, just as we do not agree in the least on disarming the Police Forces. In my opinion, in our opinion, the Police Forces are called Police Forces because they exercise and have force in the name of order, or they are Police Forces and it is permitted that they do exactly what the name, the expression expresses, otherwise there is a small philological or even simply logical short circuit. It is clear that all this is not just a question of fans, because we know, among other things, that unfortunately we live in a country where the problems are not even the criminals or those who commit crimes, or those who break the rules or those who make social life difficult with their behavior. The problem is those who support these people, and there are, there are political areas that do it, but I don't want to open this discussion. We are on the other side. We are with the police, we are with an order, we are with the rules, on the side of the rules and we do all this not out of partisanship, not out of fans, but simply because we put the safety of people in a society, in a community, first. The safety of being able to do your job, of going to work and not finding a roadblock while someone goes to open their business. We are for the safety of those who get on a train and know that at a certain time this train will arrive at its destination. We are for this safety. The important thing, however, is that truly, in a way that is perhaps unusual, and that you are not used to, colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli, I want to sincerely congratulate you, because you have highlighted a weakness, which has appeared very evident in this discussion, of the majority. There was a speech by colleague Di Marco that is absolutely acceptable. I can tell you this as a soldier on leave, very strategic, impeccable. He didn't bat an eyelid. I also congratulate you, colleague Di Marco, you have found the logical way, perfectly logical, to get out of the impasse of having to take a position of choice regarding this motion, which would have put the majority in a bit of difficulty, which evidently is made up of heterogeneous political forces, a component of the Left and an autonomist component, assuming that the autonomist component is not of the Left. However, the fact remains that the speech of colleague Di Marco had its beautiful placement, a logic, a logical thread, a guiding line and then there was the intervention of colleague Padovani, on whose contents I do not recognize myself, but I also congratulate you, colleague Padovani, because telling the truth is a sign of coherence. You consistently wanted to express your political position, trying to bypass on the Left, on the far Left, the protagonists of this initiative and of this motion, the signatories of this motion. In this positioning of yours on the far Left you have demonstrated that the majority truly has enormous heterogeneity, but above all this heterogeneity is not just the fact of saying: well, let's go and recognize the egg of Columbus. What does the Left have to do with the autonomists? Which is what not only we are asking ourselves, but the Valle d'Aosta has been asking itself since 2020. It reveals the fact that all this debate and this different positioning emerged after about twenty minutes of interruption, of majority meeting to evidently, I think, I presume, decide what positions to take during the discussion of the motions. So what went wrong? You decided that there will be a part, represented by Di Marco, which represents a part of the majority and then the other part represented by Padovani, who strongly takes a political position that bypasses the signatories of the motion on the Left. This is what is curious, this is what is important, this is what emerges, because it is clear that I could stay here and talk until tomorrow but I do not convince the opposing side, I do not convince my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli to change position. I do not convince you, colleague Padovani, to change your ideological position, but I ask myself: you are part of an area of ​​a party that is also represented by your two neighbors on the bench, by the president Bertin, by the assessor Guichardaz. So are you representing the party? Are you representing yourself? I would like to understand what the others in the majority think. What is the position of the majority? Is it Di Marco's position or the other position? This is an important element and this is the reason why I congratulate my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli. You have brought to light this absolutely contradictory situation and this is the majority that is governing the Valle d'Aosta Region."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,44,3264,"I won't take much time, I want to reassure my colleagues who are tired, and we all are. My colleague Guichardaz has already said, obviously, if we are presenting this motion, it is because we are absolutely convinced of its validity and of the fact that the ""Security"" decree, the bill that was approved by the Chamber and that must be discussed in the Senate is dangerous and is absolutely contrary to a series of issues that we believe are important. I will give just one example, which is linked to... there would be many, but I will give just this one, which is linked to the issue of the ban on selling SIM cards to irregular migrants. I will borrow the statement that was made by Oliviero Forti, who is the immigration manager of the national Caritas, who said that this is a highly discriminatory measure, especially for one issue: because it does not only affect people who are in some way totally irregular, but also those who incur this ban and therefore will be deprived of this possibility... (intervention by a Councilor, off microphone) please! ...all those who are waiting for a residence permit, who have all the requirements, have completed the process and are just waiting to have that piece of paper that allows them to look for a job and be here, will also be deprived of this opportunity. I am also reporting the position of the Church, because this was in ""Avvenire"", which I believe has not yet become an extremist newspaper. I really don't think so. There are also doubts on the part of a whole series of magistrates, prison directors, who are worried about the effects that this type of bill will have. I will move on to the second part very briefly. It was said by my colleague Di Marco that this motion is outdated, that it makes no sense because in any case the bill has already been voted on in the Chamber. Now, the bill has been voted on in the Chamber, to become definitive it must also be voted on in the Senate, but nothing prevents some parts of that bill from being modified. If a bill is approved by one of the two Houses and the other branch of Parliament makes even minimal changes, that is, it does not vote en bloc on the text that was approved by the first House, this must return. The Senate could make changes, if it makes even small changes, the text will return to the House and the House will no longer vote on the entire bill, but only on the amended part. From a formal point of view, therefore, there is nothing that prevents this from going forward. Go and see, that's how it is. If it were not so, we would have abolished bicameralism in Italy, but at the moment it is still like that. Then on a whole other series of issues that colleague Manfrin addressed, in much calmer tones than usual, but because there had already been the previous outburst, we would have to respond point by point. We don't have time, it's late, we're tired. The motion will certainly not be withdrawn and the vote, as I believe someone else has also said, will then have to, as on many other occasions, be the litmus test of what people actually say, think and act, because otherwise they are words, words, words."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963.0,M,UV,46,4199,"Obviously not for a question of punctiliousness, but I repeat that the previous passage is absolutely not compliant, because the motions of order are specific motions. The Rules say: ""points of order or for the agenda or for the priority of votes"". Finished. What you invoked was a personal matter or, at most, you should have asked for the jury of honor, honorability. You had no right to interrupt Padovani. That said, therefore, even the reference to the evaluations of the Rules... they are specific, but you did not make any reference to the Rules, nor to the order of votes, nor anything else. On the motion I believe that in the end there is a specific activity simply to plant flags, exactly like the ""Security"" decree. Because the ""Security"" decree, you see, introduces and leverages problems that are real. How can we ignore the fact that there are real problems of public order? The problem is to understand whether the ""Security"" decree solves these problems, because this is what we need to talk about. Colleague Di Marco said: ""we are against it, but because we believe that this tool is a propaganda tool. Let me explain. If something is prohibited, because a whole series of facts are already prohibited, we do not resolve the issues by increasing the penalties. Because here we do great advertising, electoral propaganda. A whole series of crimes that you have indicated are already not permitted and so, if they are not permitted, someone should already prevent them from being committed. With this logic of saying: ""we increase the penalties"" do you think you are resolving the problem? Absolutely not. You see, when we go abroad - and, in some ways they are right -, they ask us: ""but excuse me, what is the difference between prohibited and strictly prohibited?"". If something is prohibited, it is prohibited. So you are making propaganda on the fact that it is strictly prohibited, but things already cannot be done. Today is it permitted to block the highway? No. From this point of view, that is why we say that this is an instrument that is absolutely propagandistic and, if the colleagues had had a bit of intellectual honesty, they should have recalled the contrary vote of our Deputy, who voted against already in September. From this point of view, we were already clearing the field on the fact that this majority, composed of people who roughly represent all the movements that supported the candidacy of our Deputy... to understand what the orientation was, but not because we do not know the problem! We know the problem, but, from this point of view, the instrument is an incorrect and propagandistic instrument, just as this motion is propagandistic, if you will allow me, because it is simply to be able to have a showdown within the Left area. We believe that the commitment is an unvotable commitment, because if someone had written: ""commits to urge the Parliamentarians to vote against"", it might have made sense, but what the hell kind of democracy do you have in your head? The excerpt. The excerpt of what? That is, a bill that is being discussed in Parliament... (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...no, but you didn't write what you want to excise. You spoke in general about the excise... Have you also taken on Manfrin's way of doing things? (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...so you're making a personal issue... no, because taken from the fact that you insisted, I think that colleague Minelli thought that that was an example to follow, therefore speaking over colleagues. The excise of what? In the request it is written the excise tout court, of the entire decree law. Look, it doesn't work like that. If it's a rag, say what you want to excise; if it's to vote against, say that we must vote against; if it's to vote against, we've already satisfied you, we've already done it. For something that has already been done, for us this motion, as it is set out, is unvotable. For the sake of dignity, we will not vote against, we will abstain, because you have presented something that is technically unfeasible."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,48,5552,"Very, very briefly, first of all I understand and I understand perfectly, Mr Marguerettaz, that it happens rarely, because I have to recognize your particular ability, you have frequented this room for several years and know how this room works in depth. A couple of times, however, you have to admit that you were caught off guard and this is one of those times. As I was saying, I therefore also understand the reasoning that you made subsequently, because you will never admit it, obviously, but, if there had not been this dispute, whether regulatory or otherwise, I am sure that you would not have intervened, nor would you have expressed an opinion. You would obviously have left, as you have done hundreds of other times, for probably one of your colleagues from the majority to express themselves on the merits. You are not used to taking a position and would not have expressed the positions that you expressed, because obviously today you have a bit of post-match tension on you and that is fine and I understand it, so we know well what happens. What you probably didn't understand, however, is what the content is, but I say it absolutely without animosity and without wanting to start a debate, also because we will certainly have more to discuss in the coming days. Article 60 of our Rules of Procedure establishes that ""points of order, or for the agenda, or for the priority of votes? are three different cases, so either a point of order, or for the agenda or for priority? interrupt the discussion"". We agree on this, we have established that these interrupt the discussion and interrupt the speech: that's why I evidently said... Obviously what happens? That, if I ask with a point of order to speak, therefore I interrupt the discussion, at that point I receive the floor from the President who asks me to explain the point of order. Which, however, was not done, because, when I asked for the floor to speak, the colleague was not blocked and I was not given the opportunity to explain the point of order. I therefore stubbornly insisted, because my right was to make a point of order. The point of order, which I then made subsequently, was precisely for article 58, therefore facts that undermine the honour of a Councillor. It is therefore clear that the failure to suspend the discussion and the failure to give the floor to the undersigned evidently made me intervene in a vehement manner, also because, as you will remember at the beginning of these three days of the Council, I had received a rebuke from the President, who had accused me of being... how could we say... he had told me that I was a little too shy. Since I have an infinite series of defects, but I am not shy, I thought it appropriate to re-establish things a little and the truth of the issues, therefore evidently I thought I was defending a right. It is therefore clear that the point I made was meant to interrupt the discussion, the discussion was interrupted only at a later time, but I believe that what happened is on record and we will be able to discuss it later. On the merits, I believe that technically my colleague Sammaritani can best express the position of the League, which will obviously vote against the motion, but I also think that it is not because, colleague Minelli, I let off steam first that I am kept calm afterwards: it is because it is precisely the anger that has come out of some of your close colleagues that has persuaded me that perhaps this is the best weapon. The best weapon is precisely to highlight that exactly, as my colleague Distort said, there are positions that are diametrically opposed within the majority and I thank you for your action, which brings them out in all their violence and in all their virulence, because I know that every initiative that is made, regardless of the justifications that are given, because obviously there is no one who intervenes with this violence and with this thirst for revenge, who then would like to vote for the one he believes in... what you wrote... the person who is on your right, but would like to be on your left, because he would like to represent an even more extreme wing than the one you represent... he would like to vote with every fiber of his body and, if he did not have these obligations of the majority, because obviously the things they told him to keep him in that position are two: one, you make him the President of the Commission and, two, if you do not make the President of the Commission and you do not stay here, the Fascists will arrive. Because they told him this, this is what happened and this is what is holding him back. I have a great passion for his resistance and stoicism, but above all a great respect for the great work done by another colleague, who has become multiple Vice President of several Commissions, who has to manage Commissions different from his own, and above all who has to try to contain and find a compromise when it comes to topics that he obviously cannot resist voting on or expressing himself. With a good tug of the ear, here he is... or with a good tug of the ear or with good consultation he always manages to bring home the result. A result that for him is a winning one and for someone else it is not, but, fortunately, the accounts will be done in the end. I truly thank you for having brought this motion and I hope, I truly hope, that you will bring others."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,50,6056,"I will try to intervene briefly, also out of pity for everyone, and certainly without presumption of putting an end to this discussion, interesting because, apart from the regulatory aspects, it has involved issues that are both technical and clearly political. Evidently they are two different visions of how to manage a State and public safety in particular. Well, I must say, I do so because I claim a certain intellectual honesty, which I am always against... I have never liked emergency decrees nor laws made on the wave of emotion, therefore, when penalties are increased following a road accident, etc., I have never liked them, because I still consider them to be chasing events, which certainly does no good to justice and not even to the management of safety and justice itself. Having said this, I must say that what has been said, also by, for example, colleague Marguerettaz, who is always astute in his interventions, is not entirely correct. In the sense that there are many other examples of cases in which there are crimes that already exist, behaviors that are already clearly illegitimate and sanctioned by the Penal Code, but then they are detailed in greater detail because in a certain historical moment there are particular conditions, for which there is a certain particular sensitivity towards certain behaviors. I'll give you an example for everyone: 612-bis of the Penal Code, which precisely because it is called bis means that it was placed after, in fact you all know, the red code, stalking, harassment. These crimes already existed, these behaviors were already crimes, but certain aspects were detailed in greater detail because they wanted to protect women in particular, or in any case people who are the object of particularly serious behaviors towards relational life, social life. The same consideration applies to this ""Security"" decree, it is obvious. Provisions have been adopted that arise from a Government that has made a particular commitment to security and that is also evidently a reaction and a satisfaction, in quotation marks, I say in a good sense, to those who voted for it, evidently, because perhaps those who governed before had not done so. If you let certain things go, you let a sense of insecurity pervade society, you will probably then have to put some brakes on it. It may also be that you do too much, but don't worry about that, on the other side there is the Constitutional Court, there are the magistrates, they do it, they will evaluate. Many lawyers have also contested this decree, then I'm not looking at the political orientation, etc., because it is quite transversal, I must say, probably for the reasons I expressed before, the Order of Physicians, etc. Very well, there is no problem, problems are solved in the courtrooms, it will be the judges, it will be the Constitutional Court that will say: ""here you have exaggerated, this is even unconstitutional"". Very well, we will take note of it, period, but that is the issue. The problem is that clearly this legislative measure, which is in progress, was naturally the occasion and what better occasion for the Left to cry out about Fascism, repression, etc., etc., but this is in the game of roles, of course. The paradox, one of the paradoxes, because there is more than one, is rather that these things come from those who have never dealt with security, or have dealt with it too little, and have regenerated that insecurity in society that then demands these answers. Colleague Padovani, we do not need to go to the United States to be protected, we already do it here because, thank God, there is a Government that now we believe protects us, but before it did not. This is the fundamental issue. The other paradox is that precisely these criticisms of this system to resolve things, that is, to increase certain penalties and provide for certain particular cases, come from those who, in reality, do the same things, but in a much more subtle way, because perhaps they don't have the courage to say: ""look, I'm making a rule that prevents you from speaking or, better, if you speak about certain things, you are a despicable being"". They do it in a much more subtle way because they implement a certain marginalization, a contempt for those who express different opinions. It also becomes quite paradoxical, moreover, the fact that one could think of going to dialogue with the No TAV with dialogue and listening, because I really think we have the wrong approach. We have already seen it extensively. On certain types of crimes I can even agree, on certain types of aggravating circumstances or rules I can even agree on the fact that perhaps they could even be excessive, but, as I say, it is not up to us to evaluate that. On other things, such as employment... I'll give you an example and then I'll close, the arbitrary occupation had already shown the lack of legislation. It should be remembered that this article also talks about the emergency procedure for the release of the property. Here we really have to weigh up the mutual interests, that is, is it more important to protect the person who occupies the accommodation or the owner who, poor guy, finds his accommodation occupied and doesn't know what to do? This also happens here, as my colleague Manfrin has already mentioned, it has already happened here that someone, even with public functions, in any case of protection of public property, went to the Prosecutor's Office to say: ""they've occupied our accommodation, what do we do?"". And the Prosecutor had to answer: ""I don't really know what to do, let's hope he goes away"". Do you understand? This is the impotence. There is a need for regulatory intervention. To summarize, precisely, let's say that this type of measures are necessary: ​​they are necessary because people want more security and therefore, if there has been some exaggeration, precisely, the bodies responsible for clarifying it will take care of it. We will clearly vote against this type of motion."

Just one consideration. Colleagues, if this is the way to put this majority in difficulty, you are really off track, really. You are so off track that, for once, the Deputy we elected two years ago two months ago has positioned himself and represented us unanimously. Colleagues, you are really off track. I'm sorry, you also make me a little tender, if I have to tell the truth, on a political level, and let's not go into the contents because I think that my Group Leader today was really very good on the contents. On a political level, you really make us a little tender."

This last intervention makes me smile a little, not so much because of the tenderness, but because... but not to smile, but to laugh, because you made a movie of yourselves all together, that is, you decided everything you wanted to do with this motion, what the objective was, to make one side clash with the other, to put the majority in difficulty. Read what is written and retrace the steps that we have represented here on some contents. We have no problem saying that what we have written and what we think of that ""Security"" decree is what we have thought in terms of the issues on which it is going to intervene from the first day we came in here. There is no problem, from our point of view, no intention of putting who knows who in difficulty. Everyone has their own conscience, everyone is responsible for what they believe in, what they do not believe in, for the calculations they can make or not make, for the fact of remaining consistent with their principles, their values, or not. Period. That is it. Then, whether there is an excerpt in the request or another expression has been used, never mind, it does not change the substance. We know very well that the bill can be changed completely from one House to another, or in part, there have already been precedents, that is not the problem, but if someone believes that the measure is a measure that goes against what he believes in or what he is fighting for, then vote, period. There is nothing else. There is no desire to put who knows who in difficulty. Everyone is also responsible, before a chamber, a majority or political forces, to themselves. I believe that this is what must be done."

After that, whether you really make up stories about what we think, or whether you go and find fault with the commitments when you write laws that you then go and modify a month later, because you wrote them badly, with the offices that help you... I ask myself: but really, instead of going and finding fault, if you agree with those things, change the commitment and vote yourselves too. I find everything that happened here today in this last part of the debate truly absurd and surreal. After that, it's fine, we'll vote, everyone will take their responsibilities and say what they... I was pleased that the colleague also intervened, because often on many motions we don't hear him and it's important to also have the opinion of the political force that is most represented at the moment, so, from this point of view, thank God that he finally got his say again in this Regional Council.

Based on what has been said, I believe that my position on the issue is very clear but, in case there was any need, before reading for the umpteenth time some posts on social media with distorted information and unfounded accusations, I would like to reiterate the concept, and I will do so very calmly, to demonstrate to the entire Chamber that I am sincerely not angry. The ""Security"" decree is for me a liberticidal decree, which brandishes the Penal Code and threatens penalties in order to erase any expression of dissent. This is sincerely something that, as a citizen, worries me both for today and for the future, but there is a ""but"", as they say, and I would like to thus get to the commitment of the motion under discussion. I believe that the binding, as has already been said, is in itself out of place, because the decree, in addition to having already been voted on in the Chamber by our Deputy, who obviously rightly expressed himself against it, would commit the Senator of the League to request the deletion of a provision, which moreover - and I look at the only colleague who has had experience of Parliament, the deletion of a decree in parliamentary law does not exist, I am comforted - is impossible in parliamentary law, which her party supports so strongly. I think that this thing makes absolutely no sense. Although I reiterate my total opposition to the provision in question and have sincerely not understood what the use of this binding is, which, among other things, my colleagues have said can also be interpreted in many ways, but then in the end we vote on what is written... I sincerely, given the binding, do not see the point in participating in the vote, so I will remain in the chamber but will not participate in the vote."

Regarding the premature passing of Gioachino, I think it is worth remembering a man who has left an extraordinary memory in our community. In some ways, Gioachino is the son of a particular culture, you see, his mother is a Bertholier, who is an expression of the culture, of the Aosta Valley tradition of Courmayeur, and on the other hand Tony Gobbi, a person who was not from the Aosta Valley, but who chose the Aosta Valley as his land. You see, this situation allowed Gioachino to grow with values, with curiosity, with incredible intelligence and this allowed him to take a path that is enriching for him and for the entire community. He managed to relaunch Grivel as a leading company in a particular sector that is typical of our culture, that is, mountaineering equipment. A successful entrepreneur, but not only that, he considered himself a compulsive collector and, if any of you were lucky enough to be at his house, to hang out with him... he actually had the opportunity to collect and gather everything, a symptom of great curiosity. Accompanied of course by his loved ones, in particular his wife Betta, his children, Caterina and Oliviero, a person who also put himself at the service of the community because he was President of Courmayeur Mont-Blanc Funivie for years and always tried to create the conditions to create convergences, to create sharing, therefore an activity that we particularly appreciated. Finally, I remember just one detail of his generosity: when today we go to Skyway and we arrive at the Pavillon and we find this great work, if we look on the right, there is the old station. That station belonged to his family, to him, who gave it to our community. I believe that the Region, our community should truly evaluate and appreciate his journey. Unfortunately, today there will be the funeral. We, as a group of the Union Valdôtaine, gather around his family, I repeat, his beloved Betta, who so fondly called him the bear, and his children Caterina and Oliviero. Rest in peace."

He was a visionary because he believed in innovation, he believed in re-proposed tradition, he was a great collector and I will always remember the two and a half hours spent in the summer of 2020, when he presented me with a large part of his collection with great attention to detail and he lost himself almost like a true enthusiast, more than a technician, of what he had collected in telling also the anecdotes, with which this collection had been and was being composed. However, I also want to remember him personally with one of his peculiarities, he was a visionary, he was a popularizer, he told, he knew how to tell, but in his judgments he knew how to be extremely seraphic, clear and decisive and perhaps there the Bertholier blood came out more than others. I remember him at almost every presentation of any kind of initiative, Jardin de L'Ange, where he had a seraphic judgment for everyone, for me first and foremost and I always thanked him for his very, very direct judgments. Courmayeur today loses and bids farewell to one of its sons, like many others. As Creuméyeurèns I don't know if we will be able or up to the task as Creuméyeurèns, especially the younger part, to replace or in any case to be able to carry on the legacy that people like Gioachino have left to our country. We will try to do it as best we can, without forgetting the contribution that these people have given and what they have represented for Courmayeur-Mont-Blanc but above all also for the whole Aosta Valley. The RV group offers its condolences to the family and I personally bid farewell to his wife who was truly one with Gioachino, ""One without the other - they often said - we are nothing"". She certainly won't be alone, because her family is there and that's how we want to remember Gioachino Gobbi."

I met Gioachino almost 20 years ago, introduced by the then President Caveri, when Rossignol, the company that made ski poles, was closing down with forty families who risked finding themselves on the street from one day to the next. The Gobbi family, with great courage, took over this business, making it a successful business too, creating the ABC Company, a business that is still going today, maintaining all the jobs and then also bringing the production of Grivel to Verrayes. From this point of view, the foresight and great vision of the future that Gioachino put first on Grivel and then on his other business is very evident. I would like to remember him for this debt of gratitude that I believe the community of the entire Media Valle owes to him and his family for what they did. I also want to remember him - I had the opportunity to get to know him over the years - for his human side, a human side of great sensitivity, of great empathy, which he managed to put into his work, making his company a family; all the workers in his business truly had this feeling of being part of a family that had the honor in some way of bringing this all-Aosta symbol to the highest peaks in the world. I too, partly on behalf of my community where I come from, embrace the entire family, especially Betta, Oliviero and Caterina for this mourning that has struck them so suddenly."

Also, as the President said, the title of the Assembly was: ""The hybrid war, a danger for security and democracy"".  The hybrid war is a form of conflict that combines traditional military tactics with non-conventional strategies, such as disinformation, cyberattack, the soutien au movement insurrectionnel or, indeed, the use of non-state actors. Their main objective is to destabilize or afflict an adversary, tout en évitant a military confrontation, pas seulement militaire, directe et en restant dessous du seuil d'une war ouverte. This type of warfare is often used by troops or groups likely to attack political, economic or strategic objectives, tout en maintenant a certain ambiguity regarding the origin of the attacks. The work is done on three panels: the first one is: ""Manipulation of information, cyberattack, intrusive interference and instrumentalisation of history, those actions placed in place are envisaged, comments should be defended without being distorted; the second one panel c'était: ""Les impacts de la guerre hybride et de la guerre menée par la Russie en Ukraine sur la politique, dont la politique de défense, sur les droits et sur les valeurs démocratiques""; finally, the three panelists here: ""Those perspectives pour une Europe en sortie de la guerre"". Colleagues, the delegation composed of the undersigned, my fellow secretary Corrado Jordan and my fellow councilor Marquis, with the presence of the general secretary of the Council, Dr. Perrin, followed carefully. So, just to share some moments that were very touching, because, as long as the topics are treated theoretically and we talk about hacking, we talk about introduction, let's say, you can follow with a certain coldness but, when there are testimonies of people who live the war every day, here the emotions are different. There was Volodymyr, this Ukrainian philosopher, who every morning says: ""I have three children and I don't know if I can take these three children to school, because, when the siren sounds, Unfortunately, I cannot take them and, when I take them, when the siren sounds, instead of being at school, these kids are in the basement"". When you listen to the Prime Minister of Kosovo, who spent two and a half years in prison, tortured, to fight and have freedom, you understand that emotions change; the values ​​that we sometimes express of freedom, of democracy take on a non-trivial intensity. So we are experiencing very serious situations, we are experiencing them in the East, in Ukraine, they are experiencing them in the Middle East and these large groups are equipping themselves to carry out truly terrible activities; when we talk about cyber attacks, these are situations where reality is confuses with fantasy, but all this only leads to tragedies. So, if there is a function that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Francophone world must have, it is to try to network and create the conditions so that the values ​​of democracy, of freedom are not just words, but become effective behaviors. The delegation has drawn a contribution, it was a very positive experience and we will try to capitalize on what we have heard and learned in these three days of work."

When asked for an explanation, the President of the Commission justified himself by saying that he had been impartial and that it was a technical Commission and not a political Commission. English: We would appreciate it if you could direct the Presidents of the Commissions, perhaps through the application of Article 9 of the Regulation, therefore by convening a Group Leaders' Meeting and clarifying that, when the Commission is convened and a politician is convened - in this case it was a Mayor who had availed himself of the right to be accompanied by a technician that he himself will have authorized -, it maintains a political function, because this is our role and not listening, not even waiting for the completion of the question... therefore, not being able to understand what the orientation of the question was, it is an assessment that we consider rather hasty, which then led to the consequence of having to stop the intervention of colleague Di Marco. We would therefore appreciate it if these situations did not happen again. If one of us went off the rails, it is right to stop them, but not even allowing them to ask a question seems really exaggerated, we are going too far.

We had already sent a letter on 15 October, we waited, in the last Council you had briefly mentioned that it had been discussed in the Presidency Office and after more than a month, after 37 days, to date we have not received any response.

We are talking about a question that concerns the entire community, as well as the people directly involved. The failure or delay in delivering this opinion is not admissible. We are often told that people, citizens must know the law, that ignorance is not allowed and here on a law that is in force, that has existed for a long time, since 2007, no interpretation is given, we cannot understand how it works. I believe that this wait is really a bit too long and it also seems to me that the opinion should already be there, I believe that it is already there too. The fact that it is not delivered, or in any case that all this time is being taken to give an answer to the Councilors, in my opinion, President, also appears to be an omission of official duties on your part, or at least it seems to be so. I therefore urge that this opinion be there as soon as possible, because it seems to me that it is truly strange that after 37 days, on a regional law that has existed for almost 20-17 years, we are unable to give an interpretation."

Since you adopted a yardstick that time and I in the Group Leaders told you that at a regulatory level that was not the yardstick to adopt and today the correct criterion was adopted, then this criterion from now on will be applied like this, because otherwise, as always, for friends the rules are interpreted, for enemies they are applied.

We consider it necessary to share with the entire Board some considerations regarding the inaccuracies expressed in response by the colleague and then taken up by the press, so as to signify, within this room and to public opinion, the correct operation and absolute compliance with the legislation on which the choices made by Finaosta in setting up the managerial structure are based. This in a perspective of maximum transparency and sharing, with the aim of not fueling sterile controversies based on incorrect assumptions. The company, with regard to the organizational measures regarding the identification of top management approved in September of this year, confirms that they were adopted in full compliance with current legislation, national and regional and internal regulations, as well as in compliance with the applicable implementing provisions. In particular, the company highlighted that, as clarified by the most recent case law, with regard to publicly held companies, a technical distinction must be made between the recruitment of personnel from outside, for which Legislative Decree 175/2016, the so-called ""Madia law"", requires, as is known, the carrying out of selections in compliance with certain public criteria and instead of career advancements. With regard to career advancements, the Court of Cassation has recently established, in fact, the principle according to which it is to be excluded that the recruitment discipline, dictated first by Article 18 of Legislative Decree no. 112/2008 and then by Article 19 of Legislative Decree 175/2016, can be interpreted in the sense of also including career advancements. This has been implemented both in the resolution of the Regional Council no. 899 of 6 August 2024, which renews and replaces the previous resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022, as amended by resolution no. 454 of 29 April 2024, which in the regulatory provisions of the company applicable to the case in question.

The new regulation for recruitment and also for internal progressions of Finaosta comes into force on November 4 and the guidelines on which it is based are those that were approved before August 2024, so you understand that the rules are made first and then applied, not the rules are applied first and then made, because in the order and hierarchy of sources there is the national law, there is the regional law, there are the resolutions and there are the internal regulations of the participating companies and it is the same thing that was generated already on another appointment of the regional finance company in which a degree was required for a certain top figure and I remember that the Statute had not yet been modified. The time frame is therefore not trivial, because otherwise we do not give ourselves rules. Objectively, why did I refer to the previous guidelines of December 2022 and to the regulation that was in force when I presented the initiative? Because that was the regulation at that time. First you change the rules and then you do things, otherwise there is a problem of some sort. In any case, I wish the budget law good work and, I repeat, because perhaps it is not clear, that it is not a problem of updating the information by the undersigned, but it is of applying the laws and applying the rules in the order of the times in which they are approved, because I did not make the regulation on November 4, whoever did it unfortunately in that place had applied it previously, which is a bit strange.

I would therefore ask you - and I appeal to the Bureau and especially to the components that represent the minority - to give voice, even in the context of the approval sessions of important measures such as this, to the requests that all the opposition forces have made, because, otherwise, I repeat, we have a problem, because it is useless to ask for collaboration or proposals from the Council if on the other side there is no possibility of operating efficiently and above all that can allow us a more autonomous management of certain processes.

This is intended to be more of a spur, then obviously our vote will be in favor and, having said that, I hope that we can finally, beyond, I repeat, the competitive procedure, find a way to be able to close at least this legislature in an efficient manner, as we are trying to do day by day."

The budget forecast is not just a formal exercise, but is essentially the main document with which we intend to say what we want to do, so it is true, as is well specified, that the cost of personnel, as well as the overall management of personnel, is essentially an activity that is done with the personnel structure, therefore with the part referring to the Administration and the Regional Council, however, I repeat, at least from the point of view of the positions taken or in any case internally also of the considerations, it is the budget forecast that establishes and defines how the Council is organized.

47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Rosaire,Roberto,1965.0,M,UV,2,10719,"First Permanent Council Committee - Institutions and Autonomy. Lead Committee. Bill no. 166. Second law for the maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024. This bill, aimed at the periodic maintenance of the regional regulatory system, modifies some regional laws relating to different areas and consists of 13 articles divided by sector of intervention. The aim is not to radically change the current legislative discipline and to make necessary changes aimed at improving the understanding of the text, better combining the various laws in force with the new regulations with which, in some way, they are connected. With regard to the working method followed, each Committee examined the articles of their respective competence and, where deemed necessary, made the appropriate changes. The Second Committee, during the meeting on 28 October 2024, examined the articles: - 3, which contains provisions regarding the regime of the assets of the Valle d'Aosta Region of which the regional law of 10 April 1997, no. 12, aimed at updating and simplifying the procedure for the sale of regional real estate. The aim is to reconcile the interest of the Region in not selling off its assets with that of not maintaining, in its assets, assets that are no longer functional to institutional purposes and that imply excessively high custody, safety and management costs; - 13, finally, containing the financial invariance clause. The Second Commission, in the meeting of 28 October 2024, expressed a favourable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Third Commission, during the meeting of 29 October 2024, examined: - Article 6, which inserts into Regional Law 18 January 2001, n. 5 (Organization of regional civil protection activities), Article 7bis, in order to promote informed and responsible behavior by those who are in the regional territory, with reference to the presence of risk situations present in the same, as well as in relation to the frequentation of mountain environments, taking into account the characteristics, morphology and climatic variables of the territory itself. The new law intends to promote a culture of information and a greater sense of responsibility, which allow to prevent, or in any case limit, the cases of people in danger and accidents caused by careless or negligent conduct, as increasingly frequently detected by the Civil Protection; - Article 8, which contains an amendment to the regional law of 20 November 2006, n. 26 (New provisions for the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads), in line with the provisions on the management of the safety of road infrastructures of the legislative decree of 15 March 2011, n. 35, in order to define the procedural aspects for the adoption of the regulations regarding the management of road safety along the road network under the jurisdiction of the Region and local authorities; - Article 9, which contains provisions on agriculture. More specifically, paragraph 1 modifies Article 18 of Regional Law No. 17 of 3 August 2016, which regulates aid intended for land improvement consortia, in order to ensure greater clarity of the law, so as to contemplate the financing of all expected project costs. Paragraph 2 modifies paragraph 3 of Article 23 of Regional Law No. 24 of 21 December 2016 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2017-2019), which establishes the financing, in the form of an advance, of certain aid provided for by the 2014/2020 rural development programme in favour of agricultural businesses. Given that some agricultural companies have yet to receive all or part of the aid from AGEA, the proposed article provides for a further one-year extension, until 31 December 2025, from the deadline for the repayment of the advance received; - Article 11, which amends paragraph 2 of Article 3 of Regional Law No. 8 of 30 May 2022 (Provisions on redevelopment interventions of residential and public building assets), in order to specify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, that the derogation, provided for by the amended article, to the general rule that sets the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees at 36 months concerns employment contracts aimed at carrying out interventions included in the national recovery and resilience plan, as established by Legislative Decree No. 80 of 9 January 2021. The Third Commission, in its meeting on 29 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Fourth Commission, during its meeting on 31 October 2024, examined: - Article 4, containing amendments to Regional Law no. 29 of 1 September 1997 (Rules on scheduled public transport services), in order to simplify the administrative authorization procedure, promote the effectiveness of administrative action by reducing unnecessary burdens and obligations, reorganize and simplify the current legislation. The objective, in this case, is to promote the protection of individual rights, limiting the constraints deemed not indispensable and therefore making public transport more inclusive, granting all categories of people with disabilities the possibility of deciding which type of vehicle to use; - Article 12, containing amendments to Regional Law no. 11 (Regulation of the organization of employment services and the professional training system in the autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta), making a series of interventions aimed at correcting and specifying the scope of application of the provision, also in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, in accordance with the principle of loyal cooperation. The IV Commission, during the meeting of 31 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned articles. The V Commission, during the meeting of 30 October 2024, examined: - article 1, which amends article 9bis of regional law 17 March 1992, n. 8 (Regional interventions in favor of a Foundation for the enhancement and dissemination of traditional musical heritage and for the development and diffusion of musical culture in the Aosta Valley), on all matters relating to the regional tax for the right to university study for advanced artistic and musical education courses, in order to adapt regional legislation to the provisions set out in Legislative Decree no. 68 of 29 March 2012, which contains a revision of the basic legislation on the right to study, which eliminates, in particular, the definition of the amount of the regional tax for the right to university study as a fixed amount; - Article 2, which contains amendments to Regional Law no. 25 (Use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region), regarding the use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region, to better clarify its scope of application by providing, among other things, the possibility for staff required to return, which may be in the afternoon or evening, to carry out their service obligations, to use the canteen service to the maximum extent of one meal per day; - Article 5, which replaces paragraph 2 of Article 39 of Regional Law 25 January 2000, n. 5 (Rules for the rationalization of the organization of the regional social-health service and for the improvement of the quality and appropriateness of the health, social-health and social-assistance services produced and provided in the region), in order to make it consistent with Article 7, does not provide for the approval of the program agreement with the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority following the amendments introduced by regional law no. 3 of 11 February 2020; - Article 10, which contains amendments to regional law no. 11 of 31 July 2017 (Provisions on the specialist training of doctors, veterinarians and dentists and non-medical graduates in the health sector, as well as university training for health professions). These proposed amendments aim to limit the regulatory constraint currently in force regarding the requirement of residence in the regional territory for access to the financial interventions provided for by the law in question. To this end, the intervention provides that, with regard to the additional regional specialist training contracts aimed at doctors, the additional specialist training positions with related scholarships aimed at graduates in veterinary medicine, dentistry and for non-medical graduates in the health sector and the positions reserved for health professions, access is permitted, provided that the other requirements are met, for candidates who do not possess the requirement of residence in Valle d'Aosta. The V Commission, in the meeting on 30 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles with the amendment to Article 10 presented by the Councilor for Health, Health and Social Policies. The First Commission acted as the lead committee for the bill and, in its meeting on 4 November 2024, examined Article 7, which amends Regional Law no. 28 August 2001. 17 (Regulations on the functioning of the Office of the Ombudsman. Repeal of the regional law of 2 March 1992 (Establishment of the Ombudsman), in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, in application of the principle of loyal cooperation. In particular, paragraph 1 of article 2quinquies of regional law 17/2001 is amended, eliminating any lexical reference that could be interpreted as limiting the protection action of the Guarantor of the rights of persons with disabilities to only persons with disabilities resident, domiciled even pro tempore or having a stable residence in the Aosta Valley, thus excluding those who are in the regional territory only occasionally. The First Commission, in the meeting of 4 November 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned article."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,5859,"Obviously, as a group, we will evaluate the measure article by article, but I believe it is useful, indeed indispensable, to focus on an article that we have already discussed at the meeting of the competent Council Commission, which is Article 11. Article 11, which is included within this law, this omnibus, which should tend to bring results, necessary, urgent changes, in short, maintenance of the text. The question, reading this article, arises quite spontaneously and I hope that my intervention can serve as food for thought: what exactly is this article for? English: We read it in the report that is attached in the article and the purpose of this article is: ""In order to clarify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of real collaboration, that the derogation provided for by the amended article to the general rule, which sets the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees at 36 months, concerns employment contracts aimed at carrying out the interventions referred to in article 1, falling within the national recovery and resilience plan"". In essence, it seems that, reading this article... that without this intervention, the employees in question - we are talking about ARER -, therefore the ARER employees who deal with renovations, could not remain in service - who were hired tied to the project on a fixed-term basis - beyond the date of 31 December 2026, or that they could not be extended beyond 36 months. In reality, the article that is being amended states precisely... therefore this amendment here, article 11, is inserted into an existing law. What does this existing law say? In paragraph 2 it says: ""In order to ensure the recruitment of the personnel necessary for the operation of the project structure referred to in paragraph 1, in times compatible with the start of the interventions referred to in Article 1, limited to the year 2022, the hiring by ARER of two non-managerial personnel on a fixed-term basis is authorised, for a period of 36 months, extendable no later than 31 December 2026. On an extraordinary and urgent basis, also in derogation from the provisions set out in the regional regulation of 12 February 2013 no. 1 - which are the provisions for access to the Valle d'Aosta Single Compartment -, without prejudice to the verification of knowledge of the French language pursuant to Article 16 of the same regional regulation). So what changes with all this? Nothing, because it is already foreseen, that is, the fact that they could be extended until 31 December 2026 and the fact that they could be extended for 36 months remains, nothing changes for ARER employees. What changes? Very simple: Legislative Decree 44/2023, converted into Law 74/2023, in Article 3, paragraph 5, modifies, with exclusive reference to the Regions, autonomous Provinces, metropolitan cities and Municipalities, the provisions of Article 20 of Legislative Decree 25 May 2017 n. 75, which - listen carefully - on a transitional basis allows Public Administrations to stabilize personnel already in service as fixed-term employees at the same Administration. The new law allows this possibility to the aforementioned territorial ones until 31 December 2026. So what happens? The Regions, Provinces, Municipalities and metropolitan cities, until 31 December 2026, may proceed, within the available limits of the current staffing, following a selective interview - we imagine quite selective -, and following a positive evaluation of the work activity carried out, to the stabilization of the qualification held by non-managerial people, who, within the aforementioned deadline, have accrued at least 36 months of service, even non-continuous, in the last 8 years at the Administration proceeding with the hiring, who have been hired on a fixed-term basis following competitive procedures compliant with the principles set out in Article 35, Legislative Decree 30 March, no. 165. Verbis brevis or brevis verbis, the formula you prefer. Without this legislative change, the staff that essentially says that the people who were employed for the PINQuA and for 110% by ARER at the end of their service would have finished their service and obviously, if they had wanted to be absorbed by ARER, they would have had to take a competition. With this change it is simply said that the funds for the projects mentioned above are for the implementation of the PNRR and are not funds for the PINQuA and for 110 and, on the basis of this, these people can be hired on a permanent basis. This need certainly does not come from the State, it is not that the State tells you: ""Listen, since you have to hire me two ARER employees, change this rule, so at least you can stabilize them for me"". I strongly doubt that the State is concerned, given that you write that there is the principle of loyal collaboration with the State, of the hiring, of the stabilization of two ARER employees. We are therefore faced with a rule that has, as they say, a first and last name and that does not change anything, it is a bit like turning the mattress from the winter side to the summer side, unless you are the mattress, then the thing changes and in fact, the mattresses are there and there are two of them and they can be stabilized and hired on a permanent basis by the Public Administration with this change, which does not change anything, does not move anything and is not necessary. We, obviously, will not vote for specific regulations for mattresses, if you do... we wish you good luck but we believe that evidently a regulation has been made here, let's call it pre-electoral."

I will briefly intervene on article 11, a commitment already made on the occasion of regional law 12 of 29 July with the budget change. On the issue, the Legislative Office had discussed the matter with the competent offices of the relevant Ministries, with a confidential correspondence, a commitment therefore to better detail a rule, a precise provision, which gives the possibility of derogating from the 36 months in the use of personnel, which is a consequence of the activity connected to the construction sites in progress with PNRR financing of ARER, in particular the PINQuA financing, which is financed with the 23.2 million and the nine lots of works already all awarded, most of which have already started with work in progress, therefore a correspondence that remains, which is, as said, confidential and was going to better define and concretize this procedure."

I would like to focus on article 6, which is an article that has a very important impact on the future of behaviors on our territory, a mountain territory, a territory that has a morphology, characteristics, climate variables that are very important and this article underlines the importance of the principle of self-responsibility on the territory and on the usability of our paths, our roads, our outdoor activities and it clears a path of responsibility within the users, especially of the activities that take place on our territory. I believe it is a concept that in other contexts, including European ones, is already very developed and that must become a bit more commonplace, in the mentality of those who carry out activities and who must consciously assume responsibility for the danger and any critical issues that may arise when dealing with the territory, a concept of zero risk that does not exist and that is also part of this particular moment of climate change, including geomorphological changes, which characterize especially very particular territories such as the Aosta Valley. Within this bill there are other much more specific indications, this is a somewhat broader principle that I thought was right to underline and highlight its importance in this particular temporal context."

A few more words need to be spent because perhaps with this article we are trying to fill a legislative gap at a national level, a gap that has led to a jurisprudence that is much discussed and sometimes I dare say has led to jurisprudential distortions. It is clear that, by introducing this concept of self-responsibility, we allow each individual who faces the mountains, or ski routes, or other routes in the Aosta Valley even by bicycle the freedom to independently determine their own way of facing the route, of facing the mountains, but which obviously imposes at the same time full responsibility for the choices made. Doubts arise when this person is accompanied by someone who is responsible for accompanying them. All this to say that it was an important step, but perhaps the path is still long, so this article is welcome, but the invitation is that, all together, we work on it further to take a further step forward and encourage those in the area - I see that the Councilor who deals with mountains has booked - of these very skills... perhaps our representatives in Rome can work perhaps in future legislative productions to further clarify this aspect."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,14,1575,"This issue was raised in the Coordination, in the Commission that deals with mountain problems. I illustrated an amendment proposed by the Aosta Valley in the hearing that took place in the Senate during the examination of the bill that deals with modernizing the 1994 law on mountains. I must say that with the various interactions that we had both with the representatives of the Südtiroler Volkspartei, and in particular Senator Durnwalder, but also obviously in connection with Senator Spelgatti, there was work by the Commission and then by the Chamber that allowed us to have, within the text already approved by the Senate, a regulation that concerns this issue that should also cover that part that cannot be covered by the regional law, in particular the criminal issues, which obviously cannot be the object of a regional regulation. We are examining, also with colleagues who deal with the issues of trails and the impact on tourism, whether it will be the case to further clarify the text of the article that has already been approved, which however is already a significant step forward. Now the law goes to the Chamber, I will have the honor, as a representative for the mountains of all the Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, to be heard in the Chamber, and we will return to the point if necessary. The current text is already significant and in any case I believe it should be appreciated, and I am happy that you are, that in the meantime the Region is setting limits within its own legislation."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Cretier,Paolo,1963.0,M,FP-PD,16,3482,"Good morning everyone. A brief, comprehensive statement, I would say, on this beautiful day of work that awaits us in this beautiful week. The omnibus contains a series of modifications, additions or repeals made necessary to respond to the maintenance needs of the legislation in force, which requires adjustments to improve some regulatory passages and its applicability. This is my thought. For example, article 6, which makes the companions responsible, or even ourselves, especially in mountain environments, but extensively throughout the regional territory, thinking - and sometimes having the ability - to give up reaching a goal and the set objective. Giving up saves lives, our lives, but also those of those who must intervene in extreme conditions. I quote an article read in a local weekly: ""Only the rescue of the Guardia di Finanza saved 48 people"" and I would also like to quote Hervé Barmasse for his declaration of renunciation in an interview during a climb in Nepal, which he had to give up for obvious reasons, however, in my opinion, every now and then the decision must be made and you have to give up. We are at the forefront of information, the very efficient Civil Protection system that we have operating here in the Valley, is always not enough, the foundation of article 6 is self-responsibility codified by the Civil Code and in this case the realization of other people's interests without risking one's own life or that of those accompanying us and at the same time of expert rescuers, trained but operating in extreme conditions. Article 8, the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads. The complicated network of rather dated regional roads physiologically requires ordinary and sometimes extraordinary maintenance interventions, with significant financial interventions to guarantee the passability and safety of the citizen, the worker, the student and the tourist who climbs into the Valley. Of course, it is also necessary to think about alternatives to avoid closure, the isolation of economic activities and give the possibility of re-entry, which are sometimes prevented by very dangerous calamity situations. Article 9, the issue of agriculture and the company connected to it. The timing is sometimes now guaranteed by a regional complement that will be approved soon, today I hope. Sometimes the changes in data management create too many temporal hitches in the pure reading of the data, of the value of the application, for which it is necessary to extend the deadline to 31 December 2025 for those companies in difficulty. In cases of repayment of advance sums, these companies - few in truth compared to the total - can have a breath of fresh air. Article 11, a necessary derogation to carry out the interventions included in the PNRR, strengthening the administrative capacities of the Public Administrations, functional to its implementation. These are just a few examples that are connected to the III Commission of which I am a member and the mission is in particular agriculture, health of the territory, public works and civil protection, directly linked to the articles mentioned above. As a group, we will vote on the bill for the necessary changes to openings and approvals to be made today. The Federalisti Progressisti Partito Democratico group will certainly vote on this bill."

You can try to fool someone, a few people for a long time or many people for a short time, you can't fool many people for a long time, so simply we will see what happens and if, as we predicted, there will be a permanent hiring of the two people in question, we will have evidently been right and we will take note of this. As a Lega group we have already expressed our position, our thoughts on the vote on the article, evidently on the overall omnibus law the Lega group will abstain."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Malacrinò,Antonino,1977.0,M,FP-PD,2,12373,"Good morning everyone. This bill contains the second measure of variation to the budget forecast of the Region for the three-year period 2024/2026 and consists of twenty articles that contain provisions for the registration of greater revenues and greater expenditures in the budget forecast. The increased resources are mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that hit the Aosta Valley on 29 and 30 June 2024. The document also contains the provisions for the ratification of the budget variations, carried out by resolution of the Regional Council, which authorized the variations arranged to make the funds available for the first post-flood interventions. This legislative provision is characterized by the registration of increased revenues in the three-year period 2024-2026 for 35.9 million euros that will be allocated to the financing of the interventions listed in Chapter I. Overall, for the year 2024, the authorizations relating to recurring expenses are increased by 2.1 million euros, the investment expenses by 32.8 million euros and the expenses for the increase of financial activities by 1 million euros. Specifically, this bill is composed of five Chapters: Chapter I relates to new authorizations for expenses and is composed of ten articles. Article 1, paragraph 1, establishes that the allocation for the granting of contributions to families and productive activities for interventions relating to overcoming the emergency, following the flood event of 29 and 30 June 2024, is increased by 3.9 million. Paragraph 2 provides for the possibility, if new resources are made available by the State, to collect them directly, without having to pass them on to the beneficiaries who have already been compensated with regional funds. Article 2 establishes the extraordinary transfers in favor of local authorities to cope with the significant investments necessary to carry out interventions to restore the damage caused by the flood. Paragraph 1 gives the Department of Civil Protection and Firefighters the power, following a survey of the damage suffered carried out by the same Department, to transfer to the Municipality of Cogne, as established in letter a), a total amount equal to 13.8 million euros for the implementation of interventions regarding the restoration, after the initial emergency works, of the municipal road system, of the seriously damaged underground services, as well as of the hydraulic regulation works usually carried out by the regional structures competent in matters of public works, territory and environment. Letter b) also provides for the transfer to the Municipality of Valtournenche, which was also seriously affected by the flooding at the end of June, for the necessary interventions to restore the functionality of the aqueduct and sewerage network, of a total amount of 4.4 million and also provides, in letter c), a total transfer, equal to 500 thousand euros, to finance the interventions connected to restoration following the flooding events in the remaining municipalities of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta. Paragraph 2 defines the methods of transfer of the funds intended for the Municipality of Cogne and the Municipality of Valtournenche, establishing the possibility, upon request of the Municipalities themselves, to provide an advance of up to 50% of the expected amount and to defer the balance of the allocation to the reporting to the Regional Department of Civil Protection and Fire Brigade of the interventions carried out. Paragraph 3 establishes that, with a resolution of the Regional Council, to be adopted after consulting the Permanent Council of Local Authorities, the list of interventions carried out in the other municipalities of the Region, excluding Cogne and Valtournenche, is drawn up and the criteria and methods for transferring the related resources are defined. Article 3 provides for the granting of a contribution of 500 thousand euros to the Municipality of Cogne for the organization of the ""Nordic Ski World Cup"" competitions, awarded by the International Ski Federation, which will take place from 31 January to 2 February 2025 in consideration of the important tourist-promotional implications and related economic benefits, resulting from the holding of the aforementioned competitions in the location hit by the floods. Article 4 authorizes and finances two urgent interventions for the safety of strategic infrastructures and the territory. The first intervention aims to review the structural layout of the state-owned canal Ru Arberioz, to complete the emergency forecast action conducted during the calamitous event of 29 and 30 June, to guarantee the supply of water for agricultural, livestock and fire-fighting uses in the municipalities of Aymavilles, Jovençan and Gressan. The second intervention instead involves the reconstruction of the state-owned canal of the Ru Baudin, ensuring hydraulic safety conditions and water functionality for agricultural and livestock use in a territorial area with a high residential density and to protect the strategic infrastructures connected to the hydraulic structures of the municipality of Aosta. Article 5 authorizes the granting of direct contributions to reduce the interest and processing costs applied by Finaosta on loans to support businesses that have suffered damage or indirect damage from the flood of June 2024, ""indirect damage"" being understood as a drop in turnover of at least 20% resulting from the comparison between the data relating to the months of July 2023 and July 2024. It is expected that the contributions will be paid to businesses through Finaosta and under the ordinary management referred to in Article 5 of the regional law of 16 March 2006 n. 7. For the provision of contributions, a special temporary endowment fund will be set up at the regional finance company for the duration of the repayment plans for loans to businesses affected by the flood and it is envisaged that unused resources will be transferred to the fund referred to in Article 68 of Regional Law No. 3 of 13 February 2013 (Provisions on housing policies). The burden resulting from the application of this Article is determined for the year 2024 at €955,212.95. Article 6 authorizes the increase in the allocation for the interventions envisaged by Regional Law No. 29 March 2018. 6 (Regional interventions to support sports infrastructure in cableway complexes of supra-local interest and refinancing of regional law 18 June 2004, no. 8 (Regional interventions for the development of cableway systems and related service structures), by inserting, in derogation from the procedures provided for by the aforementioned law, the possibility of providing extraordinary capital contributions aimed at restoring sports infrastructure damaged by the flood event of 29 and 30 June. Paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively introduce amendments to paragraph 3 of article 4 and paragraph 1 of article 5 of regional law 6/2018, in order to adapt the limits of investment aid for sports infrastructure provided for by the same law to those defined by EU regulation 651/2014. Article 7 increases by 1.6 million the financial endowment for the granting of contributions under regional law 1 August 2011 no. 21 to support businesses and freelancers adhering to the bodies of collective guarantee of the Fidi-Confidi of the Region, in order to avoid the proportional reduction of the contributions granted taking into account the greater demand recorded during the year 2024. Article 8 follows the request for funding by the Federico Chabod regional boarding school to cope with safety interventions in the building where it is located, in particular for the design of the new fire prevention system, for the renovation of the smoke detection system, for the modernization of the fire prevention system, for the replacement of emergency lights, for the supply of fire doors and for the replacement of anti-trauma protection systems in sports fields, for a total expense of 200 thousand euros. Article 9 provides for the financing of 700 thousand euros necessary for the construction of additional mandatory works for fire prevention purposes and for the payment of the charges related to the revaluation of prices relating to the regional swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier as part of the architectural, energy and structural improvement intervention. Article 10 provides for the recognition of an extraordinary contribution of 70 thousand euros to social welfare and welfare institutions for the year 2024 for the increased support and information activities carried out, to guarantee citizens access to the benefits and measures provided to support the less well-off categories. Chapter II provides for the registration of increased revenues in the three-year period 2024/2026 and is composed of a single article: Article 11, which provides for the registration of increased revenues of 35,902,212.95 euros deriving from the recognition of taxes devolved on the basis of the revenue of the year 2023, including a balancing payment relating to previous years. Chapter III provides for the ratification of budget variations and is composed of a single article: Article 12, which ratifies the content of a series of budget variations adopted by the Regional Council, pursuant to Article 36 of Regional Law 12/2024, to address the first aid and relief works of the flood event of 29 and 30 June. The total amount of the decreases is equal to €21,041,164.95. Chapter IV contains other provisions and final provisions and is composed of two articles. Article 13 redetermines, integrating the amount, the financial resources allocated to local finance interventions referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1, of Regional Law No. 25 of 19 December 2023 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2024/2026). Article 14 contains the recognition of spending authorizations contained in regional laws. Chapter V contains other provisions and final provisions and is composed of six articles. Article 15 provides for amendments to Article 19 of Regional Law No. 7 of 12 June 2024 (Adjustment of the Regional budget forecast for the year 2024), amendments aimed at enhancing the value of the property called Palazzo Cogne to be used as a university residence. Article 16 provides that the term of office of the Board of Auditors for the Region, currently set at three years, be set at three financial years, so as to allow the extension of the audit activity over an entire financial year. It also provides for the extension of the assignment of the members of the Board currently in office, expiring in February 2025, for a further term. Article 17 contains provisions on the sale of real estate between the Region and local authorities, providing for an extension of the scope of application of regional law no. 68 of 23 November 1994, on the sale of real estate between the Region and Municipalities. In particular, this amendment allows for improved synergy between local authorities and the valorization of their property, with the possibility of extending the use of some assets for institutional purposes to other authorities as well. Article 18 contains urgent amendments to regional law no. 46 (Rules on Secretaries of Local Authorities of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta) and regional law no. 22 of 14 November 2023 (New provisions on the recruitment of secretaries of local authorities of Valle d'Aosta), to integrate the regulations on the recruitment of new secretaries of local authorities, in view of the next general municipal elections in autumn 2025. Article 19 lists the annexes to this law. Finally, Article 20 contains the declaration of urgency. The 2nd Permanent Council Commission, which met on 18 November 2024, examined regional law no. 171 presented by the Regional Council on 6 November 2024, concerning: ""Second variation to the budget forecast of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta for the three-year period 2024/2026"" and expressed a majority favorable opinion."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,4,10297,"The press release of the II Commission of last November 12, 2024, in addition to giving notice of the appointment of the rapporteurs of this bill, rightly represented this as composed of provisions concerning the registration of greater revenues and greater expenditures in the 2024/2026 budget forecast, mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that hit our Valley on June 29 and 30. The adverb gives an account of the fact that within the provision there are not only rules or measures aimed at restoring the infrastructure and the places affected by the sad events of June, or contributions to deal with the damage suffered by families and businesses, but also of the other. In this sense, the subsequent comment, the one I will represent, will be divided into two parts: the one relating to the articles concerning emergencies and the one relating to other interventions. For the record, it must be said that in the aforementioned press release, in particular in the statements of the President of the Commission, the colleague rapporteur of the majority, among other things, there is no trace of the fact that, in addition to the hearings of the political counterparts, the Councilors and Mayors interested in various capacities, which would then have been held during the morning of Monday 18, the possibility of hearing also the representatives of the trade associations interested was denied by the majority Commissioners through the voice of the President of the II Commission. The opposition forces have criticized and are criticizing this choice even today, because it has limited the possibility for the entire Commission to better understand the problems connected to the negative effects brought about by the flood event in June. A step that could have been managed differently, in line with what, among other things, has already been done in the past for situations of similar magnitude. This is said for the record and for the facts. The first two articles are closely linked to the flood event. Article 1, allocating resources to contribute to families and productive activities through regional law 5/2021, that of the organization of regional civil protection activities, Article 2, transferring resources to support investments by the affected local authorities, including in particular the Municipality of Cogne, the Municipality of Valtournenche, as well as in favor of other local authorities. Overall, regional resources that will then be covered with national funds that will come from the procedures implemented by our Civil Protection with the national counterpart. Resources that, based on the progress of the interventions, may also, in the near future, need to be increased, as emerged during the hearings organized in the Second Commission. Article 3 allocates resources to the Municipality of Cogne as a contribution to covering the expenses incurred by the same for the organization of the ""Nordic Ski World Cup"" race. Some considerations: without a doubt, the inclusion of this provision in the scope of this provision was also determined by the timing of the assignment of the race by the International Ski Federation, just as this opportunity undoubtedly constitutes an important opportunity to relaunch the tourist resort hit by the events of last June. However, it is noted - and some colleagues will certainly add details of commentary during the general discussion - that to date the methods of support and sports competitions of this level, and not only, are increasingly characterized by ad hoc measures, cum titulo, etc., making each situation unique, without a clear underlying strategy and/or potential effects deriving from the synergy with other measures or initiatives. Article 4 allocates significant funding for the safety of two state-owned canals: the Arberioz and Baudin canals) whose details of intervention were the subject of an in-depth study in the dedicated hearing. Article 5 establishes a temporary revolving fund, in line with the duration of the financing granted, for the reduction of the interest on the processing costs applied by the regional finance company for the granting of financing to companies affected by the flood. A measure presented to the attention of the Group Leaders during the last meeting to update the situation by the President of the Region (for the record, already partly anticipated during the September meeting); an information in line with the commitment signed and approved by majority with the resolution of the Valle Council of 10 July last. A commitment that, even if it overlooked the expected weekly cadence of the information on the evolution of the emergency management, was nevertheless implemented with meetings held on July 5, July 15, August 14, September 17 and October 1. The measure provided for in Article 5 was presented in the October meeting, then the final text was subsequently sent quickly to the minority group leaders. In this sense, it is important to point out that there was no sharing of intent on this measure, but rather a sharing in the informative sense, following which the minority forces took note of the proposal currently being examined by the Valle Council; we will certainly return to this point in the general discussion. It is certain - and it is good to question the issue - that time counts for the proper functioning of these tools and today time runs faster than the speed of legislative production. For this reason, we can do nothing now but hope for a rapid provision of this measure for the benefit of companies that request it. Article 6 will allow the restoration of sports infrastructures damaged by the flood event through the refinancing of regional laws 6/2018 and 8/2004. I now move on to further interventions. Article 7 defines the strengthening of the endowment of the fund for the granting of interest rate contributions to law 21 in favor of Aosta Valley businesses through the Confidi. Articles 8 and 9 relate to the interventions to be carried out at the Federico Chabod regional boarding school in Aosta and on the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, interventions that certainly need to be carried out, and therefore financed, but which we would have preferred to find within the scope of a provision not necessarily linked to the emergency events of June. This is because there are certainly other measures that would require equal consideration, but which today have not been brought to the attention of the perimeter of this second variation. At the same time, we would have preferred to find, within the scope of a provision so mainly linked to the flood emergency, other measures in favor of the areas hit by the flood last June. The same goes for Article 10, which allocates funds to social welfare and welfare institutions. As for Articles 15, on Palazzo Cogne, and 16, that of the Board of Auditors, and 17 regarding the sale of real estate between the Region and local authorities, we asked ourselves during the hearings and renew here the doubt as to why they were not included in the scope of the law for the maintenance of the regional system just discussed. I will now go into more detail on the provisions regarding the recruitment of secretaries of local authorities, of which we have, among other things, taken note of the presentation of an amendment this morning by the President. With the bill 147 for the maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024, the one presented by the Government on May 24th and then voted in June, the abrogation of... paragraph 5 of article 1 of law 46/1998 was repealed. A certainly complex issue, that of municipal secretaries and in a broader sense that concerning the legislation of our local authorities, also and above all due to the stratification over time of new laws and various articles of amendment presented for this purpose. It must however be said that during the hearings and then in the debate in the chamber on that article 5 of the bill 147 we had repeatedly asked for explanations and further clarifications regarding the consequences that this repeal would have entailed in view of the preparation of the recruitment notice for the new municipal secretaries, but nothing. Today we find ourselves with a further amendment that also arises from the path taken subsequently in the First Commission - and I would say that we find ourselves with a further one this morning -, a path stimulated by the request for hearings on the point by myself and colleagues Erika Guichardaz and Claudio Restano. This, among other things, after the Secretaries' Agency itself, with a note last October, rightly asked the Region for a ruling, they asked for a legal opinion on the point, in fact it materialized with these two proposals. What emerged is that the regulatory framework resulting from the June amendment was anything but clear as we had been told and could even have led to possible problems and further repercussions on the publication of the notice by the Secretaries' Agency. On this I make a comment: in all the hearings that were held in the First Commission, we said it: our request is not a desire to disturb, but a desire to clarify and avoid the generation of possible disputes following the publication of the notice. Today we are at the umpteenth amendment, what can I say? What is represented in this report certainly does not claim to include all the positions of the minority forces and in this sense the ensuing debate will certainly allow us to further explore more than one aspect already considered here, but it also wants to try to provide those who read and listen with good elements of reflection and a fair duty to report on the contents of this bill. I obviously reserve the right to intervene also following the debate on points that are more politically sensitive for our group."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,7188,"I obviously thank the minority rapporteur who in his report wanted to represent all the parts of the opposition that will discuss the measure today, I see many colleagues already booked, because obviously there are also differences of position between the oppositions, but what is clear is that there are many dark sides to this measure that we are going to discuss. Some have already been raised, on others I will do a further study, this is a provision, which, as we know, has been long-awaited, we talked about it, as has rightly been said, in the days immediately following the flood events and however it arrives late with respect to some needs that have been reported several times and as if that were not enough, after a long discussion, the bill 171, which should have been exclusively intended for the flood emergency, arrives weighed down by various other articles that contain a bit of everything: from swimming pools to the Convitto, from the municipal secretaries to the student residence, with regulatory changes that should have found a place in the omnibus law, discussed as you have seen before this one, there would have been no problem, no criticality in transposing the rules that modify the regional rules into the omnibus and instead it was preferred to insert them in this provision. This insertion evidently causes reactions, because if it had been preferred to focus a law exclusively on the flood, as was also requested by the opposition groups in the Second Commission, the opposition council groups would also have been left free to agree or not with the content of a potential emergency law, instead it was preferred, and we must say this perhaps also in an instrumental way, to try to fill as many articles as possible without any coherence between them and it is not clear whether this is due to an administrative incapacity - and we have denounced this several times - which always manifests itself in the form of self-amendments and bills deposited by the Government, we see it, a law is deposited and then the amendments of the same Government that deposited the law arrive, perhaps even without hearings, which is something that honestly leaves one a little surprised, or - and here it would be even more serious - for a subtle political choice, that is to avoid that the minority could with its own contribution take some credit for having tried to support families and businesses in the areas hit by the flood. If that was your concern, Mr President, I will put you at ease right away. Here at least in my group - but I am sure that it is the same for the other opposition groups - no one wants to steal her alleged glory or the merits that she wants to propagate in splendid solitude, as, for example, happened last Saturday for the little party she attended, with a few other members of the majority, in Cogne, worried that someone might overshadow her, but I think it is right to tell the truth and, if collaboration is asked for, because this is what was asked of us, at least listen to the very few basic requests that came from the opposition, because, yes, the Group Leaders were updated sporadically and laconically, with information that a minute later, but often a few minutes earlier, was released by the media and on several occasions - I say this for the benefit of the record, colleague Aggravi has already done so - there was talk of sharing in the halls outside with the opposition forces, but the sharing stopped at a hearing, as said sporadic, of the Group Leaders, without any expression of assent on our part or sharing of choices or proposals. On the other hand, Mr President, this measure carries with it a very serious shortcoming, a shortcoming that alone makes some of the choices almost devoid of legitimacy, as well as revealing an evident fear of submitting them to an opinion by those who propose them. I, Mr President, believe it is necessary to highlight the seriousness of what happened in the Committee, when you decided that on a measure containing articles entitled: ""Provisions on contributions to support businesses hit by floods"", businesses should not be asked what they thought. Well yes, colleagues and also citizens of the Aosta Valley who I hope will listen to us outside of this chamber, what I have just described really happened. I am not making anything up, I was sitting right here when the minority's request to hear the trade associations, and I specify: ADAVA, Confcommercio and Confesercenti, the majority responded no, not limiting itself to a refusal but adding that - listen, listen - such hearings were not relevant to the law. A law that should provide aid to businesses should not be submitted to the scrutiny of the representatives of the businesses themselves, because this majority knows, in its unquestionable judgment, that what it does is right and the others can fend for themselves. So, since you did not have the courage to submit this mess to the trade associations, we will do it, carrying out a good truth operation so that outside of this chamber it is known what the majority intends to do in favor of the businesses hit by the flood. Well, do you know, dear entrepreneurs and dear people of the Aosta Valley, what the aid for businesses and economic activities hit by the flood consists of? In loans, yes, exactly, loans that will arrive perhaps, if this law is approved, in a few days, therefore, as said, seriously late given that the tourist season has already begun and that they will not be of use to those who have seen the tourist season taken away by collapsed roads or bad publicity from the media, which have painted our region as an enormous quagmire. If you had made an investment to best face the season, but you saw your turnover wiped out, if you were preparing for the current season and your business was destroyed by the flood and your products drowned in the mud, then you will be able to take some money that you will then have to return, widening the deficit created by the flood. All this should be a help that no trade association has had the opportunity to analyze to express an opinion for fear that it could highlight its doubts or even its opposition. I say this for the benefit of the information bodies that perhaps have been badly informed. It is not a rain of money, it is not even a dew of money, these are just funds with a rubber band that unfortunately I fear will not help anyone: this is why, in the face of this very serious choice, the responsibility for which falls on the highest representative of this majority, we have filed an order of the day that, instead of providing money with a rubber band: ""I'll give it to you and you'll give it back to me"", asks for real compensation, compensation for those who, in an emergency situation, have seen years of sacrifice and job prospects erased. We will therefore evaluate the will of this majority there."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,8,5507,"I too will begin my speech by thanking the speakers who illustrated the bill that was downloaded, a bill that we imagined would be focused and place all its attention on the flood emergency, but, as anticipated by those who spoke, it contains articles that are mainly interested in mitigating the effects of the flood, but then there are also a whole other series of articles that raise doubts at an organizational and procedural level, because we also believe that they could have been contained in the omnibus provision and this perhaps denotes a bit of progress with an organizational method that leaves one thinking. Beyond this, there are also a whole series of articles for the ratification of budget changes made with the resolutions of the Council. The provision in its consistency manages 35.9 million euros that are put in the expense account, of which 2,100,000 euros on current expenses and 32.8 million euros in capital expenses. I would like to draw some attention to the first articles, which are those relating to the flood emergency. Article 1 allocates an additional 3.9 million euros for Law 5/2021, the civil protection law, to meet the needs of families and businesses, after which the other articles are essentially focused on public property, on the municipal restoration of all public works that were damaged by the flood, in particular 13.8 million are allocated for Cogne and 4.4 million for Valtournenche. Article 3 500 thousand euros in favor of Cogne for the organization of the ""World Cup""; article 4 ru d'Arberioz and ru Baudin, also provides for investments in the arrangement, after which we move on to article 5. Article 5 is an article that essentially provides for interest coverage for mortgages that will be opened to those who have suffered direct and indirect damage from the flood, to companies that have seen a reduction in turnover compared to 2023, therefore both contributions for the reduction of interest and the costs of investigation, this will be managed by Finaosta. We believe that, as a measure, it can also be a good measure, but this is not the instrument that, from our point of view, should have been used to manage this situation. A situation in which we would have hoped for a behavior by the Region that was complementary and integrated with the behavior that has been implemented at a national level, because there are a whole series of businesses and economic operators that have suffered significant damage especially in these two communities: the community of Cogne and that of Valtournenche, which cannot be humiliated in this way, but must be helped by the Public Administration. For this reason, therefore, also in the budget variation we presented an agenda that we had already presented on the occasion of the discussion of the DEFR, in which we wanted to anticipate the issue because by now the elements were clear on the table of how the management of this administrative practice was developing. Today we also had the pleasure of hearing, from all the colleagues who spoke from the opposition, that there was no sharing - as had been slightly implied when we brought up the topic during the DEFR discussion - from the opposition regarding the substance of this initiative of Article 5, it was a sharing of information, information had been received from the regional government, in particular from the Councilor, who had said: ""Our idea is to carry forward the solution to this problem in this direction"", a direction that we, already then, had seen did not correspond to the needs of local operators. For this reason, therefore, we have presented an order of the day that goes in the direction of introducing compensation for those who cannot obtain compensation at a national level because it is a level of competence that is not foreseen within the Ministry of Tourism. We will return to this later. As regards Article 5, in itself it is an article that can be supported, but which has substantially a different purpose than that of compensation, because it is about having a tool for opening mortgages, which are something other than that of obtaining compensation. Then there is article 7, an article that we can also share, because, although it is not linked to the strictly emergency issue, it meets the Aosta Valley production system, implementing a transfer to the Confidi to reduce the cost of interest that companies have supported and are supporting with difficulty in this period following the increase in the interest rate also in the Aosta Valley. Then there are all the other articles, which are the articles that have been cited, which essentially regulate issues that do not concern the emergency situation, but which could have been addressed, in our opinion, within the omnibus or even within the budget forecast. We will then express our opinions on these at the time of voting on the article. As far as we are concerned, our approach will depend a lot on what the attitude and behavior of the majority will be towards the agenda that we have presented."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,10,9476,"The second budget change came after the budget board's approval and I also believe that this confirms the doubts about the organizational and planning capabilities of this board. Despite the urgency of the situation, bill 171 arrives four months after the floods, leaving too many to make do and, as reported in the Commission in the last Council, it arrives without sharing on such an important issue, but simply with a few information meetings. In July, among other things, with my colleagues from Rassemblement we had worked on a resolution with the majority precisely to ask to be updated weekly on the developments of the floods and the various interventions, but, as councilors Aggravi and Manfrin rightly pointed out, there were five meetings, often they were also requested in light of the fact that the news was published in the press and none of us knew anything about it. English: Sharing then, as has been rightly pointed out by all the Group Leaders who preceded me, has not even occurred in the Commission since the hearings proposed by the minority have been largely denied, while for us it would have been important to hear those stakeholders who have had to give answers in these months. In other emergency situations - and I am speaking especially of the first part of the legislature, when President Lavevaz was at the head of this Council - these sharings, especially on interventions that concerned the entire community, have occurred and have been shared so much that they have often obtained a unanimous vote in the Chamber. Let's get into the merits of the budget variation that has been proposed to us, meanwhile we note that there is a handful of articles dedicated to the emergency, which in some way provide for small contributions to families, businesses and extraordinary transfers to Municipalities, all partial and in many cases insufficient. Regional resources then, which, as has been rightly pointed out by the minority rapporteur, will be covered by national funds, therefore in some way not resources of the Region. Once again, there will be people who will not be able to benefit from any help, except perhaps the contribution of 5 thousand or 20 thousand euros, because, if they are already in difficult situations, they will certainly not go and take on new debts, which in some way can weigh on their activities. In addition, I will be told... it has also been represented to us that we need to think about insurance, which most likely does not respond to natural disasters like in this case, or that we will have to make do in some way. For businesses, we note that the season has already started and access to new mortgages, as I was saying, means having new debts. : This is then associated with the problems regarding the national funds announced with emphasis also by the Coordinator of Fratelli d'Italia and the various related declarations that have followed one another in recent days and to which perhaps Councilor Grosjacques will be able to give us an answer, because a problem has been detected, or has been detected by the trade associations, in the procedures for accessing these funds, very tight deadlines and also exclusion criteria, such as those that leave out bars, sports facilities such as riding stables and golf courses, but also many other entrepreneurial activities. According to some, the regional government was well aware of this situation, but evidently did not want to intervene in any other way. Perhaps Councilor Grosjacques will clarify this for us better. Another sore point that we highlighted in the last meeting is the issue of the redundancy fund still blocked for many workers and businesses perhaps due to inadequate State-Regional Coordination given that the answer was that the applications were incomplete, so perhaps, also with respect to this delay, it would be important to understand what the real reasons are. Even with respect to the funds for the Municipalities, as was well represented in the Commission, these will go into the multi-year restricted fund, to then be included in the 2025 budget, given that there is absolutely no time. Anyone who has managed a municipal budget knows very well that at this stage no new variations can be made and therefore here too we will talk about next year. Finally, we then note a real confusion and a bit of superficiality, which has already been noted by those who preceded me, who use this budget variation a bit to put in everything. We talked about the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, which we know, there is an article regarding the auditors, regarding ru d'Arberioz, which actually had damages related to the flood, but then we find another ru and I thank the Councilor for having passed us the requested documentation yesterday, but I have not had time to analyze it, so it will then perhaps be the subject of some future initiative. As I was saying, I believe it is clear that this budget variation is also linked to superficiality and I want to dwell a little more on what concerns the recruitment of municipal secretaries, a topic on which especially I and Councilor Aggravi have made several initiatives precisely following everything that has happened. On November 15, 2023, this majority approved law 22, which introduced new provisions regarding the recruitment of municipal secretaries; it also defined the degrees, it also defined that secretaries with five years of experience in the last ten years could access it, but only seven months later, on June 24, 2024, the same majority approved regional law no. 9, yet another omnibus, which reintroduced an old article of the 1998 law, which actually created confusion and could lead to appeals. On this, it is enough to go and look at that Regional Council to remember that the undersigned had presented a suppressive amendment, time had been requested from the Chamber to be able to discuss it since there had not been the possibility of discussing it in Committee there either, therefore, if it is said that I did not bring the amendment to the Committee, it is only because the hearings were not allowed there either. Therefore, after the presentation of that amendment in the Chamber there was a request for suspension, but then on the return, everything is fine, Madame la Marchioness, we vote and that article had been introduced. Now, bill 171 is going to modify again what was modified in November 2023, in June 2024 with yet another modification, therefore in November 2024, that is, in one year three laws have been made to somehow further mess up an aspect that we all know is of absolute importance precisely for the restart of the next City Councils. However, it is not the only thing, because, if there had been only the reintroduction of that article, it would have been a bit of a way of telling us: ""Perhaps we understood that there could be some confusion"", also supported by the President of the Register of Secretaries, by the secretaries of the first and second parties who came to the hearing in the Commission, but no, they are thinking of adding a paragraph 2 for a reserve that is decided to be for category D employees who have held the role immediately below the managerial qualification for five years, telling us in the Commission that this wording was put in for fear of challenges if another wording was used. Today we find an amendment that instead brings us back to the issue of municipal secretaries. In the Commission we are told that that can be challenged, now the amendment arrives, so I hope that checks have been done on this one, but I announce right away that of course we will not vote on it precisely in light of what was said in the Commission when the President came. Among all this then... from the discussion with the President of the register in the last hearing, we discover that two people, evidently not the two that Manfrin was talking about today, but two other people who obviously do not have certain requirements I imagine, will be excluded from this competition, because they do not have the five years, nor the ten years because they were evidently hired in the last legislature. On this passage we do not intervene, so for these two people who, from what the President of the Register said, are two people we do not intervene and I have absolutely not thought of making any amendment in order to avoid being told that I am doing it for personal interests, as if who knows who I may have or favor within that category. I believe all this clearly demonstrates the confusion that continues to reign even on an important issue such as what was an event, unfortunately, not sporadic, because we know well that we must somehow also perhaps equip ourselves in the future, because things of this kind may happen again, but what was the attitude to respond to this criticality and whether there was actually an adequate response to the needs of the population we will only find out by living. What I feel like saying is that the families and businesses that suffered those damages deserved concrete interventions shared by the entire Chamber and truly decisive, not empty proclamations and partial measures. Once again the people most in difficulty will not have any response."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,12,9198,"I had said that I reserved the right to make a couple of passages on some aspects of greater interest in relation to the action of our group, as well as elements of novelty that obviously were not in my possession, in our possession before the beginning of this discussion and which will then be the subject of subsequent discussion. First of all I would like to dwell on... and, in reality, the intervention is mainly linked, if you like, to this passage... so, in relation to the first two articles, but I would say in particular the first article, it must be said that, always for the correctness of the action that each one has done, we had already expressed on several occasions the need to be able to use a tool that already existed and that was rightly adopted as law 5/2001, which was born from an experience at the time even sadder for our Region and even more impactful, a tool that certainly needs to be updated, to be made more current also with respect to critical issues and risks that could not even be thought of at that time and above all also to make it especially on measures and interventions... Among other things, both with the President and with Councilor Sapinet I have often happened to solicit the Government benches in initiatives, but on this there is actually the willingness also on our part, to work to make the tools a little more replicable in all situations, precisely to avoid real situations or interventions that are a little too discretionary or tied to a single event, which risk also putting similar situations in difficulty and perhaps putting them on different levels. I say this because, for better or for worse, we must take advantage of these situations and make this instrument increasingly modern and increasingly feasible. Welcome, we have already said it and so has colleague Restano in the discussion of the maintenance law, for example, the principle of self-responsibility. There are all issues that require overall management. On this point, for goodness sake, I have also heard the interventions of other colleagues, who rightly said (I summarize): ""We need to do more, greater and different aid could have been foreseen"". Two orders of the day in particular were presented. I am saying this now in the general discussion to then encourage in the presentation of individuals perhaps a reply or in any case the possibility of allowing myself and our group to have a little more clarity, because I am objectively and politically confused, because if, on the one hand, the criticism is right regarding the fact that more should have been done or more could have been done, very right - and I have made it too - the criticism regarding the need to hear those who represent the affected realities. I found it really strange and absurd the fact of not wanting to do it and I say this above all for how the Council Commissions have always behaved and have always tried to give voice in every situation, sometimes perhaps even with too much abundance in some situations; in this one there was actually the need to make a transition so that it did not remain only tied to the pourparler or informal meetings, but giving a formality to this transition. There was also time to do it and the willingness to do it on the part of the opposition forces, but objectively I find myself - and I say it right away - in further difficulty hearing the closing of the speech by colleague Marquis, who I do not see but who I am sure his colleagues will report to him... the fact of essentially saying: ""We will see what to do then on the vote based on your positioning on the agenda"". Even though we have made a criticism, even though we are critical of a whole series of passages and also of some articles of the budget variation... and if, among other things, we had, in our opinion, not satisfactory answers, when we had called for using law 5 as soon as possible to avoid too much time passing... I confirm that we will vote on articles 1 and 2 because we are responsible, we have taken on a responsibility and, beyond what the position of the Government majority may be on an initiative of their own movement, for God's sake, if someone believes in certain measures, they vote for them regardless, so I confirm that we take responsibility for these two passages and we will vote on them and we will not wash our hands of them with an objective agenda. However, there is another thing that leaves me quite perplexed about these two passages. Whoever proposes them, have patience, but à maintes reprises reminds us that there are referents at the national level who are moving and working, among other things, the agenda of the Forza Italia colleagues speaks of the prompt visit of the Minister of Tourism to Aosta on July 2 and the provision of support to economic operators in the tourism sector... let's say that those 10 million seemed a bit like Mussolini's planes, however in the end the decree brought 15 million. Now, it is not a question of delegations, of those who deal with carpentry, hotels, bars, if there is a necessary aid measure, it must touch, it must be carried forward to all the operators involved. Now that a force, which in any case supports the Government and supports the current Minister of Tourism, says: ""The Minister has done everything but the Government must plan to help or at least plan support for those entities whose Ateco Code is not included in the scope of beneficiaries referred to in the decree of the Ministry of Tourism as it is not within its jurisdiction"", it seems truly absurd to me. Why hasn't something been done at a national level to also involve the other Minister or Ministers who had the delegations to act? Objectively, if I had been in the situation of my colleagues, I would not have presented this agenda, because I objectively ask myself: but you have so many relationships with the Roman referents, but what did you tell them on this point? And what did they answer you? I can't ask forces that are not represented here, and obviously it would also be interesting to know from their side, but objectively I say to myself: ""What does this agenda have to do with it - someone would say -?"", but I'm confused, so maybe you can give me an explanation. Then bear with me if I make a small political passage, but you know who is touched then rightly must also defend themselves, you continue to talk about a united Center Right, but there are two different agendas of the united forces of the Center Right, so even on this maybe a passage by me... but precisely to help me overcome the confusion, because otherwise the confusion is even greater... I don't think of myself perhaps but at the home of others and I say this because rightly in the past Councils we have made an effort to look at the home of others, so then I allow myself to look also at the home of others, but rightly perhaps you will answer us and convince us that this action is valid. Then, for goodness sake, as two characters who are both Mao Tse-Tung and von Moltke, a great Prussian marshal, actually said... we must march divided to strike united, but here it seems to me that we are not striking in unity, but you will explain it to us. Just three more steps: one is linked to the issue of time that I mentioned before, zero-rate mortgages, for goodness sake, are welcome, they are certainly a useful measure for those who have the possibility of subscribing to them, however, beyond the fact that in any case the capital quota must then be returned, the sooner they are made available the better, because today we are talking about November 20 and those who have thought about the season and everything else have already equipped themselves differently. We therefore hope that they can be made available as quickly as possible. On the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, almost all the minority groups have made initiatives, we have had the opportunity to delve into the reason for this allocation, I objectively ... if I'm not mistaken, councilor Sapinet spoke of the spring of 2025, we hope that this is the last and that we can finally get to the point, because otherwise things risk going even further. On the subject of municipal secretaries, I think I can endorse the intervention of my colleague Guichardaz, which is a passage that comes to mind, let's say, especially after the last hearing, but I don't give it as a criticism, I give it more as a topic for reflection. On the subject of municipal secretaries, we continue to talk about the number of secretarial offices. Until the secretarial offices are defined, it is difficult to identify the optimum number to put out to tender, so this is a problem that, in reality, does not so much affect the law on secretaries, but in a broader sense the reforms or the reform of the legislation of local authorities. Having said that, the solution will probably be found a little further down the line, let's try to be optimistic."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,14,3474,"Evidently Professor Aggravi, who is uttering sentences left and right, is in dire need of clarity regarding his new political grouping, namely he is part of the Valle d'Aosta Autonomist Center grouping, on the opposition side, but not so much of the opposition, because this intervention gives strong support to the majority and, on the other hand, with obviously the two Councilor Assessors in the majority with one councilor and the other councilors who are part of the opposition, we immediately understood that there is already a relationship... and that is what we had anticipated in the intervention some time ago, namely that there would probably be different attitudes and behaviors... frankly we would not have expected this attack. Going into the merits of what we are facing, on October 1, 2024 we are called by the President of the Council to a Group Leaders' Meeting, in which I participated, where the President informed us that a legislative measure would be put in place that would support businesses and so on. Obviously it was an idea of ​​strong sharing, sharing that in reality - all the colleagues who spoke said - did not exist and that somehow saw us then deal with a provision that anticipates responses and resources to the affected businesses and inhabitants of Cogne and Valtournenche, but not all, because the rules do not allow it, because from October 1st to today and in the path from July to today, because it was July 2nd when the Minister of Tourism communicated that there would be resources available, so I am sure that the representatives of the Council could have discussed to understand if everything was planned, even bars, rentals, sports facilities, or if those Ateco codes were not planned that then suddenly seem to have disappeared... it is clear that that Ministry cannot provide resources for that part. As I said last time in a Regional Council, sometimes you have to go knocking, we have done it in the past, we have always done it, but not with a hat in our hand, you have to go and say: ""Look, maybe there is a misunderstanding. I am sure that we can go in the direction of changing"". But what does the budget of this Region make available to these affected populations? How many resources does it put in place? Not advances, resources. It simply puts in place financing that, it is true, does not cost businesses, but in some way leads to indebtedness for businesses. I also make the declaration of vote because that was more or less what I had undertaken to do with my colleagues, a declaration of vote that is simple, of this bill all those articles that go in the direction of giving support to businesses and contributions with respect to the flood of 29 and 30 June we are in favor of, we will vote for them. Obviously we will not vote for the entire structure of the law, because we will vote for those articles that we believe are in support of the people of the Aosta Valley. As for the political path, probably this Forza Italia, which sometimes is not even called, I see this fil rouge from PCP to Rassemblement, I see this fil rouge that now runs and probably Forza Italia is annoying. We are therefore very happy about this, we want to characterize ourselves as being liberal, of the Center Right, liberal, even autonomist, but constantly growing and this makes us very happy."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,16,3261,"I am a poor inhabitant of a rural mountain area, I ask however for the possibility to intervene to complete what was expressed by my Group Leader, who had already anticipated a little the intervention by the other Rassemblement Councillors. I will therefore not go into the merits of what has already been stated by my colleague, but I will dwell a little on the structure of the law, that is to say, as perhaps already mentioned by someone, a law that presents itself as urgent to address what was the flood emergency, sees other initiatives involved in the articulation, which we - and above all I refer to the law of the extraordinary contribution to support the ""Cogne World Cup"" competition - see favorably and also other initiatives that could have had a different dignity, be treated with a separate law. Why do we say this, especially with regard to Cogne? Because already previously, with other laws, we have behaved differently, I would dare to say jokingly that there is a sort of political bipolarism. We found ourselves discussing the contribution of sports clubs and it was addressed with a rule defined as urgent and so motivated by the Councilor for the urgency of registering for the competitions of an important championship. We addressed the issue of the contribution to the ""World Cup"" of La Thuile, which was also defined as urgent and addressed with an ad hoc rule. In that case the urgency was defined by the need to approve, even without the hearings requested by some colleagues, because there was the need to conclude the contract with Warner Bros I think for the issue of television filming. Even Cogne, which I consider a location worthy of attention, as was said by the speakers and by the Councilor himself in the hearing, could enjoy a separate rule. English: We believe that a modification of regional law 3, which can be defined as a consolidated text of sport, which concerns, as already mentioned, extraordinary contributions for sporting events, therefore also includes another regulation of sport that concerns contributions for major events, is appropriate and we could have arrived at it earlier, therefore treating everyone in the same way, this was not possible. If we had discussed an ad hoc regulation on the ""Cogne World Cup"", we could have brought our contribution, also through specific hearings, especially and even more so of those who are in favor of this intervention, which we do not allow ourselves to criticize, but we support. We allow ourselves to underline that by doing so we are proceeding at least apparently, Councilor, because I am sure that you have very clear ideas, in a disorderly manner. In the future, therefore, we ask you to arrive at this reform of sport as soon as possible, enclosing under a consolidated text all the regulations that concern interventions in favor of sport, not only the financial ones, but also other regulations. That said, we are substantially in favour of this article, for the other articles we will evaluate, as my Group Leader said, from time to time, however we would like to underline what was expressed in this speech so that it remains in the minutes and in the future we can verify whether our opinion has been taken into account."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Chatrian,Albert,1975.0,M,UV,18,93,For a suspension on behalf of the majority groups to analyze the agendas.
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,14022,"In reply to observations that have been brought in a somewhat disjointed manner during this morning's discussion, I note, in what have been some observations, a bit of approximation in the topics discussed and also a bit of poor punctuality and poor research of what has instead been a very clear path, which aims to provide answers, where they are useful, are possible, and are shared in their path, then more or less appreciated by those who must give judgments. In all honesty, however, I must say that the reconstruction developed by colleague Aggravi - made with great attention to detail - faithfully retraces the activities carried out during these months. I do not do this to annoy colleague Baccega, who smiles at these statements of mine, but because intellectual honesty, in my opinion, always needs to be underlined, even when not all situations have perhaps developed as expected. I believe that the important answers that are given within this budget variation, which is a budget variation that, for 95% of the financial resources put into question, corresponds to needs resulting from the flood phenomenon that hit us on June 29th and 30th... it is a budget variation that leads to the ratification of all those variations, including 21 million euros, that were activated immediately to provide answers to the population, through specific interventions carried out on the territory, thanks to the activity of the regional structures and the activities carried out on site by the Municipalities most affected by this phenomenon. Of those 21 million and some that were the object of these budget variations that we are ratifying today - and which was a path foreseen within the law that we approved a few months ago - these will be reimbursed, these yes in a manner already declared by the National Civil Protection, for approximately 20.6 million euros. The other 35 million total that are made available are resources that are made available by the Regional Administration and, for a part of these (relating to the interventions mainly to be identified in the 13.8 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Cogne, 4.4 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Valtournenche and 500 thousand euros mainly made available to the other Municipalities) a request will be made to the National Civil Protection which however does not yet have any type of coverage and for which there is still no type of certainty that the same will be refunded to the Regional Administration. Therefore this is, if we want to say, a provision of resources that, if they were to be included in the compensation and reimbursement account by the central Administration to the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, will be reused and reallocated in new and future interventions; if this were not the case, the Regional Administration would find itself next year having to implement those resources already assigned to local authorities to complete the work, to find additional resources that will have to be used to complete the initiatives to support the functional recovery of all activities - from roads to the technological networks affected - and it will be the subject of the next financial programming to develop and find this type of resources. This is one phase. The other phase is instead that of attention to the resources necessary to cover the material damage. In this sense, I also anticipate an assessment that, in my opinion, has escaped most people, and that is why I appreciated, in some ways, the analysis made by the minority colleague together with the illustration by colleague Malacrinò who punctually reported the resources allocated, chapter by chapter, on this type of intervention. The 3,900,000 euros allocated in Article 1 are essentially resources intended to reimburse the damages suffered, the material damages, by all the activities that were involved in the flood management and which are, as already underlined in other circumstances, intended for this by Law 5 (although improvable, although dated in some ways, a little more cumbersome) which we have even tried to streamline, accelerating the classic times of the end of the emergency, as classically set, and accelerating the possibility of making requests for financing and requests for support for the damages suffered - with a procedure that provides for the definition, through the appraisals, through the necessary procedures to then go to the disbursement - which will lead to a compensation, where those resources are sufficient, of up to 70%. Where instead, in the face of a situation more important than these 3.9 million - and I'm also going to respond to some exceptions from the Forza Italia group - net of what will be the compensations that will be evaluated based on the resources made available by the State Administration... they will complete that range of attention that the Regional Administration rightly must have for those who have suffered significant damage. On the other hand, the discussion of sharing is a discussion where the main lines of intervention were made available on what should have been the attention to be paid to the structures, to the activities, that had not had the opportunity to work, due to the flood, in the month of July. The choice was careful, fought and also shared and brought to the table of the associations, where there were different requests, but where it was deemed (in a very transparent manner, and also very seriously, in my opinion) to share a path where these resources were made available for a relaunch of the activities from a liquidity point of view. In some cases, the situations that had occurred could lead to compensations - as we defined them - of a few thousand euros, which as a whole would not have moved the ranking of companies that perhaps have to plan the next winter activity, the next seasons and relaunch investments, and we decided to significantly support the possibility of self-financing, both to restart the activity and to create the conditions for having functional liquidity for the acquisition of stocks and so on. At the same time, and I am referring to the article on the Ski World Cup, we believed that we had to include in this bill some propulsive initiatives, initiatives that, starting from a critical situation, could give an envergure, a relaunch, to this ski resort: we did this by supporting, from a political point of view, the possibility of having the Ski World Cup in Cogne in the month of January, and to support it with a very pragmatic approach from the point of view of the use of financial resources, identifying, as the beneficiary body of this contribution, the Municipality of Cogne, not so much to diminish the importance of a World Cup in Cogne or to make it separate from the sporting world, but precisely to make immediately effective the need to intervene and to plan an event of this importance in a relatively short time, which is what separates us from today to the end of January. Other initiatives have then been introduced on the sidelines of natural disasters, which we all know well, and have gone to support the business world across the board, within which there is certainly a large part of the businesses also affected by the flood, with support for initiatives in favor of the Confidi, going to implement - and it has been underlined, and I thank those who have done so - the goodness of this path which, in recent years, in the last two years especially, has seen an increase in interest rates for those who have gotten into debt and this reimbursement in interest of the expenses incurred by our companies will in this way be compensated almost entirely compared to the law, which provides for reaching up to 75% reimbursement of the interests paid, and therefore 1,600,000 which brings the contribution in interest to the companies guaranteed by the Confidi to 4 and a half million euros. And again, the possibility - as I was saying - of having particular attention to the territory through the Land Improvement Consortia in some situations that are worrying, from the point of view of urgency, for the areas involved but also for the seriousness of what the situations could be if they are not normalized and on which we do not intervene with a certain speed. To this, which is the universe of initiatives that, overall, count about 55 million euros of resources made available for the flood, some particularities have been added that are part, in a final part of the year, of those budget variations that serve to give the most urgent answers to the needs expressed by the structures and the territory, in a way to be able to close those interventions that are urgent regardless of whether there has been a flood or not; here we are talking about the Convitto Chabod or the swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier, where we can make comments and evaluations of a broader nature and on which we may or may not agree, but which require a closing of the circle and an in-depth study has been done, the Councilor has brought it to the attention of the Council Commission and I believe that this type of attention can then be partially exploited where one wants to do so, but I also believe that it is a timely response to a territory that for too long has not been served by a structure that has a very important specific weight. I am only entering into the merits, again, of an evaluation, which is the one relating to the Municipal Secretaries. If I were the one who raised this request in the past months, I would be satisfied with the inclusion of this clarification, let's call it that; it was debated from a technical point of view, the competent Council Commission had wanted and also heard the General Secretary regarding a comprehensive examination of the uncertainties that the Agency of Secretaries had also expressed regarding the new formulations and the situation had been clarified in some ways. I believe that this type of intervention provides greater interpretative guarantees and greater clarity - just as the opposition Councilors who had expressed this uncertainty over time requested - and I think that credit should also be given to these requests, to go and close a circle today. In that regard, I would like to anticipate what will also be the illustration, if we want to do it in more detail, of the amendment that we presented this morning and which goes, as shared in the Council Committee, to a principle with which a reservation is indicated, not so much to further complicate an article that has already been the subject of many changes in these weeks and months, but to support an intention - I seemed to have accepted it in those terms - of the Chamber and of the competent Commission at a time when there were two options on the table and we had proposed, within the norm, a path that was - if you like - more respectful and relevant to what were already national regulations in progress, but with the idea, where shared by the local authorities and by this Chamber, of inserting something more specific to the experience gained by the municipal secretaries in the last 5 years, and, in particular: ""Whoever had worked more than three years within the Municipalities, already acquiring a sort of familiarity with the activities to be carried out, could be considered a candidate for the post of secretary. carry out within our local authorities"". It is a path that, in my opinion, aims to clarify and also provide answers regarding what the effectiveness of the Secretaries (who are a focal point within our municipal administrations) could be and to provide 360-degree coverage of the needs to move forward with this call. I would stop here, thanking everyone for the discussion, also thanking for wanting to share the information, because in the path of sharing that has taken place in these months - net of doing it once a week, as someone said, or less - it is always very complex to be able to transmit, in a comprehensive and complete manner, every activity that is carried out on a daily basis. We tried to do it in compliance with a commitment made, but to work for the good of the activities that were to be done, and that are still to be done now, in wanting to signify shared visions within the Government, within the majority, and make them available as information and as a reason for evaluation by the opposition, who where they wanted to demonstrate their opposition or their agreement on this type of initiative were able to do so. Today is the time to have to give answers anyway, to close a circle, and this is a proposal that seems very balanced to us, which goes to give three answers, one to those who have suffered damage (and there will be a certification of these, there will be substantial coverage thanks to law 5), one to the municipal administrations, and, indirectly, one to the companies and communities that have been involved who will have the opportunity to work right away, from December, using the resources at their disposal to plan both the planning part and the work part that will obviously be carried out in due time, as well as the activities to relaunch the activities on the territory, through the Ski World Cup but also through all those interventions dedicated to the territory with these 55 million made available mainly for the post-flood but not forgetting the other things that, as I was saying, had to be brought with more urgency than other topics."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,2834,"As we have briefly summarized, we have already presented this agenda in the general discussion of the law, because to date the much discussed article 5 provides for provisions that go to grant loans and not compensation and we know that this was one of the issues debated on which a choice had to be made. I believe that our vision and our will have already been abundantly highlighted and I must tell you, President, that in your reply you made a passage that is a somewhat cryptic passage and perhaps you can clarify it, if you want, because you said that there was a round table discussion with the associations and that there were different opinions. I did not understand whether the round table discussion with the associations, which reported different opinions, was precisely on the nature of the support that the Region had to provide to businesses. This is why this agenda is here, but above all this agenda highlights a topic that you have not addressed - and I regret this, and I hope that, before the end of the discussion and the vote, you will also have the opportunity to clarify it - namely the issue of the failure to hear the associations that we have indicated, because, objectively, it has been raised by all the opposition colleagues, and I found it incomprehensible. If in your speech - I am trying to summarize, to extract something that can go in that direction - you wanted to subtly say that there were indeed different opinions on the nature of this support provided to businesses, then you knew it and you culpably avoided businesses coming to tell us what they thought, because you did not want them to leave on the record, on the record, an opinion that was contrary, perhaps negative, or more critical, otherwise it cannot be explained. The sentence with which the request for a hearing was dismissed, namely ""They are not relevant to the law"" cannot be explained; this is an objectively embarrassing thing, so it is evident that it is not acceptable. However, coming to the commitment and the agenda, as we have highlighted and as we have reported, with this agenda we ask - and even more so if you say that there is the possibility that the funds that have been put to cover, in advance of potential support and assistance from the national side... - if there will therefore be coverage from the national Government of these funds, if the resources will be freed up with which a measure can then be established. Even more so, with this agenda we ask and commit the regional Government to prepare a measure, with relative financial coverage, that recognizes adequate compensation to businesses and economic operators affected by the flood events of 29 and 30 June."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,6,4126,"I am happy to respond to this latest request from my colleague Manfrin, because there are topics where my colleague is very knowledgeable, others where his interventions are a bit more lacking. First of all, I would like to point out that within the discussion that took place - and in which I feel he has always participated - perhaps it is also my fault, that I did not express myself in the best way, but evaluations that arose from a discussion mainly with Adava, who has been the most active interlocutor in this process during these months, have been highlighted and made available, also to colleagues. The options that had been highlighted and brought to the table, where she was also sitting, offered two types of opportunities: one to intervene with compensation, as classically understood, with a percentage of compensation of around 20% compared to the lost revenue declared by the categories, which had been identified, broadly, at around 4 million, which would have led - and I mentioned it in my reply - to compensation (which would have in some cases contributed significantly and in some cases for a few thousand euros) for many companies that had had revenues lower than 40% compared to the average of previous years. Everything still had to be certified, everything had to be lined up and everything had to be put into a context that took into account on the one hand what could be the limitations dictated by state aid, and on the other the actual reporting and bureaucracy that had to be developed in order to arrive at these reimbursements. The evaluation that had been proposed, and was proposed at the table, to which then no one said yes or no, rightly so, because then it becomes easier to perhaps go and criticize a choice that must somehow be made and say: ""No, but I preferred the other one"" ... very well, in the meantime we put one on the table and we think we can do it in the best way to provide answers, therefore we evaluated going towards a choice that could be more coherent and more positive also for those who suffered damages and for those who needed to relaunch their business, going to support them with an amount (in some ways even higher than what the individual reimbursements would have been) that however could have given all companies the possibility of supplying themselves in an appropriate manner to relaunch their season, to relaunch their work over time, making most of the resources available for a restructuring of the services that are part of the possibility of hosting new people, for initiatives such as the World Cup to relaunch the territory. I would also like to underline the commitment that there was on the part of the competent Councilor in a negotiation - that's what I call it - in a very close comparison also with the competent Ministry, which we will then talk about in the second of the two proposals on the agenda, where the Councilor and the Piedmontese Councilor have evaluated the possibility of including, where possible, also compensation in addition to reimbursements for material damage suffered, because in the Piedmontese territory, there were no structures with damage, so we collaborated to find a path that could give the two opportunities also to our territory, and I think that - net of the fact that someone is not happy and would have perhaps preferred something different - we have done a careful job and with the will to give the answer that we believe is best for this type of intervention. We did it in concert and also by comparing ourselves with the associations during the process, as we had also anticipated to you; on this aspect I think that the willingness, also on the part of Finaosta, to make available a product that can be appreciated, very streamlined and very quick to set up and activate for those who need it is an important example. Therefore, with regard to your agenda, we will abstain for the reasons we have expressed."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,8,5334,"Thank you, Mr President, for your kind reply, I also thank you for your opinion on my abilities, I appreciate it in a particular way, I am sure that instead you, accustomed to covering all roles, have developed exceptional capacities of understanding on all the themes of human knowledge and you demonstrate it daily, and we thank you for this and we thank Providence for having placed you in that position because otherwise we would have unfortunately had a serious shortage in the Aosta Valley, instead we certainly have a person who understands everything in the right place, at the right time, and for this we thank you. Net of this, you were very clever to say something like this: the choice is this because the way it was designed, that is, the way you had thought of it, therefore the percentage of lost revenue, the percentage of compensation, what came in, what was given, that is, the model that you had created was not good, and since the compensation model that you had created was not good, then that is not a viable path. President, but it doesn't work like that, it doesn't work like that at all! There are two ways, at least we said it and she admitted it too: there is the way you have taken of loans, and we will see - we have expressed an opinion - we will see how many people will resort to these loans, especially since, as we also underlined in the text, the winter season has already begun and there is still no possibility of adhering to these loans, so we will see how many will adhere to them, but above all we will see what the effect will be and what the draw will be on the measure, especially for those who have been in particular difficulty, because I put myself in the shoes of a structure that has suffered damage and clearly has to deal with it and does not have the liquidity to do so, takes loans that will then have to be returned and therefore will worsen its hole. This is a method that we will verify. He said, however, and I am happy, that there are two paths: there is the path of loans that you have taken, on which I also want to reiterate that it is not that we were given the opportunity to choose in the meetings, because we said so, we were simply informed, we arrived there and were told: ""We thought of doing this, we thought of doing that, things are like this, things are like that"", not ""Which path do you want to take? But do you think it is like this or that?"", we asked it several times, if you remember: ""Are there alternatives to this proposal, to this model, to this article?"", ""No, it is like this, we are giving it to you so you can read it"". It is not the fact of being seated at the table and being informed of what was happening that makes us in some way complicit; we have taken note of it and we have told him clearly, I think that transparency is absolutely impeccable on our part. She said she was happy to answer but in reality she didn't answer, or rather, she answered as she usually does, in her omniscience, that is, not to say: ""Well, yes, we prevented the debate because we were afraid that someone would come to the Commission to say: we don't want this measure, we don't want this proposal"", it would have been more honest instead of giving the President of the Second Commission the mandate to interrupt the hearings, it would have been more honest. ""We don't want criticism, we know everything, we have infused science, we don't want criticism"". Instead, no, but as she usually does, she says in her answer that ""Net of someone's dissatisfaction"", so one could read that someone is not satisfied, but what percentage of the activities does this ""Someone"" add up to? Because she spoke mainly of Adava, but we listed two other categories, Confcommercio and Confesercenti. Were these categories asked what they thought? Because we did, we asked them, and these categories didn't even see the text. We simply didn't want to have a biased opinion from one side to the other, someone preferred to say: ""You know what? No, we don't do hearings because ""it's like this and it's like that"" and they are not relevant to the law"". We take note, we will obviously communicate to the companies and trade associations that they are no longer companies, they must not be defined as such, because the article that establishes this possibility obviously does not include them. I'll tell you the truth, we had an idea for a moment, that is, to present an amendment that removed the word ""Companies"" from the article, because it is not relevant and therefore it was fine as it is. It would have been a provocation and perhaps it would have added something to the debate, but we believe that this is in itself evident, in reality, even in your response. It is therefore clear that you have made a choice, we legitimately propose another, then we will vote as is done in a democracy and we will see the result at the end and everyone, inside and outside this Chamber, will be able to know what one thinks and what the other thinks in a democratic way. It would have been nicer to also have the ideas of the people, but you are a bit allergic to criticism. All right, agreed, we will see how many you will collect between now and the end of the legislature."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,10,7267,"We too, as a Forza Italia group, illustrate the agenda that we presented regarding compensation following the damage suffered by the flood of 29 and 30 June. It is essentially a re-proposal of the agenda that we presented in the context of the discussion of the DEFR 2025-2027, in relation to the support for economic operators who are not affected by the compensation provided by the State. We believe that, in a perspective of collaboration between the State and the Region, it is necessary to address the issue within the context of complementarity of action and at an integrative level, as is done by the Region in many situations, I am referring, for example, to what we have already seen in the past in the context of initiatives in the world of work, training, where the State makes funds available in one sector and the Region makes funds available in the other, to provide complete coverage of the needs that exist in the territory. In this case, we must underline the constructive collaborative relationship with the center-right central government that has shown, in this circumstance and in others, to have a great consideration for our region. I would like to begin, in the introduction, from the first inspection that took place in Aosta, the meeting of July 2, with the Minister of Tourism, where the availability of a series of support aids for compensation was announced for economic operators, who are the responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism: 10 million had been announced, today 15 million were decreed together with Piedmont but I believe that the given word was kept, with the decree that was approved on November 11. After that there was the inspection in the Valley and the great attention that was shown by the Minister of Public Administration and the Minister of Civil Protection who came to realize: the Ministry of Civil Protection has made available, following the decree of the State of Emergency, 20.6 million euros to deal with the difficulties. The Region has done its part and I believe that the opening of the road after 27 days of isolation has been noted with satisfaction, an important job has been done to which all the regional structures have given their contribution. In terms of the approach that there has been to this budget variation, we had said in the illustration in the intervention of the general discussion, my colleague who spoke after me repeated it, that we would have shared articles 1 to 7 and instead, as regards the attitude on the overall vote of the provision, it would also have been in consideration of what would have been the behavior on this agenda by the regional Government. We have not made any confusion, we are very clear and we believe that the Region, for our way of seeing and solving this problem, should intervene to complement what the State has done, in the context of the activities that are excluded from the benefits that are financed by the Ministry of the Interior, because in recent days we have also seen in the press that someone says that it is a shame that bars are not included, so it means that they were a need, because, if the State had made money available, they would have been useful for these categories, not as is being said now that perhaps there was no need, because someone perhaps gets 1,000 euros rather than 1,500, rather than 500 euros and that it is an evaluation of an insignificant benefit. For us it is significant, therefore we believe that it would have been correct for all economic operators to have had the same approach from the public administration, but an integrative approach to the one that the State has set up, because we cannot always think of delegating everything to the State, we also have management responsibilities and therefore I believe that, like in a family, everyone must do their part: everyone makes available what they can make at the moment to deal with the difficult situation. I believe that the allocation that we have received from the State is important but if the State has provided for it within the categories included by the Ministry of Tourism, I believe that it would have been up to us to go and see which categories are excluded and intervene with the same methods on that type of activity. This is what we are asking for with this motion, nothing more; it seems very simple to us but also very reasonable as a proposal. We cannot understand the reason, the ratio why it cannot be accepted. By the way, it seems to me that on the issue of compensation for indirect damages, the categories have claimed it and requested it, so either the categories do not have a clear picture of the situation, or there is something wrong with the approach. We will support the measure in Article 5, but it is a completely different measure, which provides an answer not to the need for compensation, it gives the possibility of opening loans, but they are two completely separate things. We will vote on Article 5, but we ask to be able to go in this direction. To the colleagues in the opposition who said that perhaps this is the presentation of the agenda, it was also an opportunity to clarify to eliminate their own confusion, in the sense of approaching this initiative; I say that perhaps we are the ones who have some confusion lately because we no longer know what the positions are in this Chamber. We are increasingly grasping it and it would be important to understand what the real positions are between now and the budget because we will not find ourselves dealing with a partial matter like this, but we will have to manage, in about ten or fifteen days, the budget of the Valle d'Aosta Region. Our spirit is a very clear spirit, everyone knows what our position is, a central position of Forza Italia in the center-right, we do not understand instead what the self-definitions are of placing ourselves geometrically somewhere. We believe that the center corresponds to a representation that is not geographical, but of values, so we wait for the evolutions that will have to happen, but we believe we should send back to the sender observations that are purely instrumental and that also try to fuel political discord within the center-right. The center-right is a project, which is at an advanced stage because we are working together, it is nice that the League has also had a path of maturation because at the time of the DEFR the initiative we presented on compensation had not been supported, today instead it has shared this spirit, therefore it will no longer be only us of Forza Italia to represent this need of the Aosta Valley people but the number of sharing in the chamber will grow. For our part, the construction site is an advanced construction site, it is not a construction site still in the planning or design phase, therefore, to those who allow themselves to make evaluations inside the house of others, we wish to have the same success, to be able to put together the energies and forces that presuppose being able to put together."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,12,2940,"I will answer in this first line, and then leave room for my colleague Grosjacques regarding the more technical aspects relating to compensation from the State. I will answer you in a very simple way. Perhaps, driven by this political positioning, some aspect of the Legislative Decree has been lost that should have been analyzed in a more in-depth manner, as other colleagues have done and have tried to bring back to the Chamber. The first article, which is an article that goes to finance law 5, is an article that will guarantee compensation to those who have suffered damage in the territory. The procedure of law 5, the 3,900,000 euros of resources; it seems to me that article 1 will finance what will be the requests that have been put forward, moreover without the indication of an Ateco code or anything else, because law 5 does not provide for this type of development. Precisely in the context of what you say, these resources are made available to cover companies that will not be affected by the national decree, since, just to add one element, those who will join the national contribution will not have to have other subsidies, from other bodies or other public resources, to complete it. It goes without saying that the answer to your question is already within the Legislative Decree, that is, those resources there - which then are not sufficient or there are too many and which will have to be remodeled, increased, evaluated in a possible future bill... -, are already present and are there specifically to provide a response of reimbursement of up to 70% for those companies that have suffered material damage; those that will clearly be excluded and will not be contemplated within the national path that provides for the 15 million in reimbursements for the material damage suffered (therefore all those situations that will need to be reimbursed for the interventions that they had to do) will find an answer within law 5 with this first allocation that, if it is not sufficient, will be implemented, but which will guarantee a 70% reimbursement. This is the path that had already been adopted in 2000 with the flood, which provided coverage for the damages transversally suffered on the territory and which, also in this circumstance, with a speeding up, if we want, also of the law, because the law itself - I said it before but perhaps it escaped - should see, before being able to draw up the beneficiaries, the closure of the emergency path, which instead in this case is bypassed and, downstream of what will be the resources made available by the State, will see the formalization of who will be able to access the regional benefits; these are resources that are already available right away and will be made available to those people who have not had compensation at a national level. From this point of view, therefore, I feel authorized to say that the availability is already there and is already acknowledged within this bill."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,14,1214,"Mr President, perhaps we have a misunderstanding, Article 1 covers direct material damage, the decree of the Ministry of Tourism also covers indirect damage and we are talking about this, so I don't know if we can't understand. It's very simple, you tell us something to divert the reasoning. The discussion is only and exclusively on indirect damages which are called lost profits, because material damages are one thing and Article 1 does not include indirect damages. So I am telling you that there is unfair behavior on the part of the public administration in its relations with economic operators, because there are economic operators who will receive compensation for direct and indirect damages and there are economic operators who, because the Region does not put money into indirect damages, will only receive recognition for direct damages. We must not sit here and kid ourselves, because this is the truth, because misunderstanding this means kidding ourselves, because the order of the day, to put it very clearly, has this objective, to recognize the indirect damages, what the associations to which you did not want to give answers are asking. Everything else is nonsense."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,16,7037,"With reference to the agenda, if colleague Marquis agrees, I would also go into a little more detail about question time, given that the premises are exactly superimposable, so given the limited time for question time, perhaps we will delve a little deeper into the path that led to the issuing of the decree of the Ministry of Tourism. In the meantime, as a premise, you will not lead us to say that the Ministry and the Government have not done their part, also because I would like to thank the structures of the Ministry for what they have done and above all for the discussions we have had, which have been continuous and constant; however, I believe it is important to summarize some passages, because you conclude the agenda by saying to prepare a compensation measure to cover the Ateco codes not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. Then I will get to, making the excursus, telling you that those who were kept out were not kept out because they were not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, but were kept out for a choice related to resources, as stated by the general director. In your questions, you ask if the perimeter of the Ateco codes of the decree was known. We began our discussions, starting from the day after the visit of Minister Santanchè on July 2; the minister (and this is worth underlining, even if the President has already made a point on this) following the commitment of the 10 million - which then became 10 for two Regions and then became 15 due to the discussions between the Valle d'Aosta Region and the Piedmont Region and the Minister himself - had categorically excluded compensation for lost profits. The decree should have only and exclusively concerned material damages and this emerges from a whole series of correspondence between the structures of the Department and the Ministry. The Ministry, following the video conference of September 10, where the issues related to the contents of the decree were explored in depth, had sent a list of Ateco codes to identify the economic activities to which the ministerial resources could be allocated. In this email, for example, other sports activities were included: at our express request we had reported some structures and infrastructures, first and foremost the Breuil Golf Club, which had been seriously damaged by the flood and which were initially included in the email from the Ministry. We had not found the Ateco code 56.30 which concerned bars and we, as for other categories, wrote on several occasions asking to include these categories too because they had been damaged, and they are not outside the jurisdiction, because outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Tourism were commercial activities on which we did work that did not lead to the same results, unfortunately, with the Ministry of Made in Italy businesses. The Ministry had included, contrary to the first draft, also a series of activities expressly requested by us, such as the rental of sports equipment, which we know has suffered considerable damage in Breuil Cervinia, and ski schools; the decree was not submitted to us in draft form because - the explanation, I believe legitimate, of the Ministry was this - since it had been sent to the Ministry of Economy and the Court of Auditors for the relevant approval, it could have been subject to comments that would have subsequently given rise to changes - therefore the Region never saw the draft of the decree, except after its definitive publication on November 11, as you recalled. As regards the nature of the compensation, in the video conference held on October 16 in the presence of the Minister and Councilor Chiarelli (my counterpart, for the Piedmont Region), the Minister expressly asked to allow the allocation of resources for compensation for lost profits, since the Municipalities included in the Civil Protection ordinance of the Piedmont Region would have practically not had any type of compensation since no material damage had occurred, except in some specific situations. We therefore agreed and gave our consent so that the Minister could, on the basis of the agreement between the two Regions, follow up on the signing and subsequent publication of the decree. English: As regards the competence of the Ministry's matters, here some assessments were made saying: ""You asked for things that were not within the competence""; it is not true, because, if you read - as I imagine you did - carefully the Ateco codes, you found canteens or itinerant pastry shops or in any case restaurants, therefore catering activities, activities that are usually managed by the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, therefore this decree could have easily included bars as well. I say this because in the video conference of November 15, therefore last Friday, in the presence - I want to underline this - of all the business categories included in the decree, the general director of productive activities of the Ministry, at the express request - and I add that at the request of the Ministry the video conference that lasted an hour and a half was recorded, therefore you will certainly be able to obtain it through your channels - said that bars were excluded due to a ministerial choice linked to the available resources, so I believe that from this point of view all the work that needed to be done has been done. The traders were absolutely taken into consideration, because the undersigned had several discussions with the Chief of Cabinet of Minister Urso, but the only measure available to the Ministry of Enterprise was the one related to the reduction of rates for those who wanted a measure similar to the one that was set up in the budget variation: the Mediocredito centrale would have reduced the rates, but there was no type of compensation provided by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy. This is to say that we also carefully followed those who we knew would be excluded from this decree. I am closing because I have no more time but I would like to say, colleague, that you have highlighted a whole series of passages, but it seems to me that your activity, despite being government forces at a national level, is a bit like chasing after things that have already come out rather than having - and you have - the possibility of interacting, because I have heard you say on several occasions that you have telephone contacts with all the Ministers of this Government, you have said it on several occasions, so what I want to underline is that you could have intervened heavily on this decree, instead we did everything that had to be done and to hear today from national government forces that the decree is lacking and above all to hear that there are activities that have not been included..."

Councillor, I have listened carefully to your reconstruction, we are pleased that you have maintained continuous relations with the competent Ministry. From what we understand, everything possible has been done by the Ministry to make the group of beneficiaries as broad as possible, so we have a different result than what you announced, that is, that it was possible, in your opinion, to extend the benefit to some categories that are excluded in the category of economic operators; as far as we are concerned, we believe we are satisfied with the work that has been done at central level, we recognise it, we were pleased that you also recognised that there has been good collaboration, but it is precisely for this reason that we believed and believe, as I said earlier, that, in the context of a collaboration between bodies, between different institutional levels, when an approach is established, the measures at our regional level are integrated and made complementary. We are sorry that this has not been done and we are sorry that it does not want to be taken into consideration. Then perhaps it makes me stronger than I am, situations are not so simple, Councilor."

Probably some piece was lost when, in the discussion on the DEFR, all the opposition groups remembered that it had been somewhat agreed to wait for the articles, therefore to be able to examine the articles, to then be able to formulate their own position. So we did, as we had agreed, we waited to see what the articles were and obviously I will not hide the surprise of having seen the articles that should have been the emergency one loaded with a whole series of articles that concerned the universe of the world; so in something that we expected to be exclusively dedicated to the flood, instead, it is loaded with a bit of everything, but once we saw what was expected and once we also examined and listened to the opinion of the stakeholders, which we had highlighted we would have been happy to hear in the Commission, but it was not possible by virtue of the censorship applied by the President of the II Commission on the mandate obviously of the President of the Region, so in the face of this censorship, we have matured our position which was already rather clear, but we have had a confirmation. We have therefore presented with conviction and also with absolute support our proposal regarding the compensation and we will also vote with conviction on the proposal made by our colleagues from Forza Italia."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,23,3655,"Simply to express a consideration and then also the voting position. I think that the debate we have heard has been useful, although the information at our disposal is certainly partial, it is not at the level of either the Assessor or colleague Marquis, so in spirit, as we wanted to give support to the agenda of our colleagues from the League, we will also vote on this agenda. However, I would like to make a clarification: I know that colleague Marquis is much more knowledgeable in geometry than I am, but politics is often algebra and not geometry. What I said this morning... actually, I also thank my colleague Baccega for having awarded me a title that I am not worthy of, but I thank him anyway, I tend to make a very simple consideration: I did not say that you were confused and I did not even say that the centre-right is confused, I said that I was the one who was confused, because finding myself with two orders of the day, however with a non-trivial peculiarity, because I have to tell you the truth, colleague Marquis, while the order of the day of my colleagues from the League keeps the meshes open for every possible eventual application to include those who have been forgotten, you make two passages that, in my opinion, have generated confusion. On the one hand, essentially, it asks to intervene where - and, I repeat, I agree with Councillor Grosjacques - the Ministry, or in any case the Government that you support at the Roman level, has not intervened and therefore I say to myself: ""Why don't you carry out an operation of moral suasion to try to find not so much the issue of money but the ways to be able to intervene anyway?"", because the choice in any case depends mainly on Rome rather than Aosta; on the other hand, objectively, I expected only one order of the day, given that this choice was made in this place, because - I'm referring to what my colleague Manfrin said - in the previous place I remember very well that under the DEFR, rightly, all the opposition forces, without the need to connect them with red, blue or green wires, were essentially a little taken aback by the presentation of your order of the day, for one reason: in that place there was still a communion of intent, and we know that the term communion is complex, because everyone has to agree, and there we found ourselves a little taken aback. In this place therefore - it's my confusion, I repeat, you will surely have clear ideas - like a battleship you are heading towards the Dardanelles and I am happy for you, but the confusion was mine, because if I had to choose who to support, in the end I have to understand if they are saying the same thing, if they are saying two different things. The support is a support on principle, on will, also on effort, but objectively, from what I heard from the Councilor, the commitment is perhaps not entirely... or in any case what happened, or rather, even some premise, perhaps it is not entirely consistent with the path but, I repeat, we have information that is certainly partial, so it is you who must then give an explanation of what happened, and I say ""You"" in a broad sense. I did not call others confused, I was the confused one, because when you find these orders of the day, you rightly say: ""Let me understand what the position is"", considering that à maintes reprises, as I said, it is said that you are united for better or for worse, and no one wants to divide you, for goodness sake, you already do enough on your own in some things. Having said that, I repeat, in principle we will vote for it even if, in light of what we have heard, there are many doubts."

We will vote on this motion because in principle what has been proposed is absolutely correct, of course what Councilor Grosjacques said would dismantle a bit the castle built by Councilor Marquis; I know very well that outside there is also someone who is an authoritative spokesperson for Minister Santanchè who usually listens to us and surely we will soon read on his pages the very direct position of the person who certainly has the greatest contacts with the Minister, so from this point of view we will vote on the motion with the doubts that we have somehow expressed in this declaration of vote."

I would also like to make some considerations in light of the President's reply, because when he highlights that he agrees with or appreciates the report by Councillor Aggravi... I would like to highlight that in that report there are all the points of agreement that have been expressed by all the other group leaders, therefore a lack of agreement on the measure, the hearings denied in the Commission, the resources covered by national funds, the inclusion of articles that had no relevance to the emergency and even, with respect to the question of the Secretaries, the Councillor himself also referred to the considerations that I brought up during the general discussion to say that he fully agreed with what I had said. This time too I don't understand if it is linked to the way in which the various thoughts are expressed or if it is linked to the variable geometries that we hear so much about these days. Honestly, from this point of view, as the President has announced to us, surely the document that we will vote on in the next Regional Council will perhaps define the framework even better, but I repeat that I will go back and review what was said, but having also shared his minority report with my colleague, I can say that in some way I shared his and he shared mine, because the things we said are the same.

From these discussions, some observations were born that we had the opportunity to present to the III Council Commission, heard by President Chatrian in the III Commission on 19 December 2023 and after this hearing, we proceeded with notification no. 4 to the European Commission. This notification was then approved by the European Community with its own decision on 30 September 2024 and therefore today we find ourselves having to actually ratify the modification of this CSR based on the discussions that we have already had throughout the year. In addition, with respect to the changes that we agreed upon and discussed in December with the Council Commission, we have a 1% reduction in the FEASR quota - established in agreement with the Ministry, to provide a response of solidarity with respect to the floods that have hit the agricultural sector in Emilia Romagna in particular - and an increase in organic premiums of 10 euros on meadows and 5 euros on pastures to also include certification costs. This was a request that the trade associations and representatives had made: ""Include certification costs in the costs""; it was decided, through all discussions, to increase the quotas by these euros (precisely to provide this type of response) and to actually include certification costs."

It is the new reference of the common agricultural policy, a set of rules to support the agricultural and forestry sectors for rural areas, it is the founding reference in Italy to the national strategic plan, shared with all the Regions, the resources are for us about 92 million for the 5 years, with State-Region and ERDF shares. It contains all the forms of support, in particular those related to disadvantaged areas, to the compensatory payment for Natura 2000 agricultural areas and for animal welfare, for us very important and necessary compared to other realities of the Po Valley. With today's approval, real support is implemented for the agricultural world - certainly not easy to apply, we are clearly convinced of this - but which requires a temporal application effort that requires understanding the system and changes to the management of companies, changes that are not always immediate and adaptable, but these new formulas indicate new paths for production and less impactful management, with choices aimed at organic, in particular with forage production. A great deal of work has been done by the trade association, by freelancers, by the offices of the Department and by the Aosta Valley Area, to make companies adopt the binding changes, thinking about the new systems of agricultural production and management. We once had privileged environmental conditions on our side and today, year after year, we must be able to grasp the changes and constantly shape the entrepreneurial management of the climate and the trend of the market, not only local. The future hope for the sector is a conscious adhesion, already started with the knowledge of the detailed conditions, but not impossible; they are opportunities proposed as in the past, with constant and punctual payments, hoping that the Aosta Valley is always among the first places and, if not in first place, as has happened in the past, for the advancement of the expenditure of regular and punctual payments, with the collection of the measures, the hope is for everyone by the end of the year. For the companies, who have earned it, a Christmas bonus, not indifferent for the payments of rent, staff and mortgages with installments due. Furthermore, it is worth remembering once again the commitment made by the primary actors, namely the Department, with its structures and offices, the Area and the Agea, the trade associations, the cooperative system and, finally, the individual business owners or entrepreneurs, ready and aware in seizing the opportunities of the complement to be approved today.

I would like to point out that behind the word ""Agriculture"", we must not forget the entire territory, because today we have a document here and I hope that all the meetings that have been held in the territory have been acknowledged, as Councilor Carrel mentioned; I had participated not in all but in some of these meetings where all the problems and all those particularities were underlined that perhaps do not have an entrepreneurial spirit but have a very important aspect with regards to the maintenance of the territory. I hope that with this document we will meet all these requests that have been brought forward by the territory. We, as a group of Rassemblement Valdôtain, had already, reluctantly, abstained last March from approving this document, because in our opinion it did not provide concrete answers especially for these small realities, for many small realities that today maintain the territory without taking into account the economic aspect, but only for pure maintenance and tradition of the territory, with the aim of having a panorama not only agricultural, but also for the tourist aspect, that gives a different impression because, as we all know, having a well-kept territory is very important also for the tourist aspect, and I do not need to underline this. What can I say? We really learn and we hope with good luck, that this document provides an answer to the territory, to the small realities and so on. As we abstained with the other document, we will abstain, but we will work constructively to be able to provide greater resources in every sense, to be able to have a document and give answers to the territory that really go to see those small realities that today are often forgotten, but that give a very important contribution to the maintenance of the territory, to combat fires, floods and everything else that unfortunately today the European directives - they are very good, they are very important and they are basic - perhaps, with a territory like ours, when it comes to agriculture, do not affect enough with regards to the aspects of our territory. I hope that with law 17 and with other measures we will intervene in favor of these to ensure that we give more detailed and more targeted answers possibly to all these particularities, so that they continue to maintain our territory as it has always been maintained, as we inherited it from our ancestors."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,16752,"This bill deals with urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities. The Aosta Valley is considered a mountain region in its entirety; on the maps we study at school the percentage of mountains is 100%. We, if we are objective, and above all grown up compared to when we went to school, do not consider this aspect true, or at least not in its entirety. There are municipalities, or at least parts of them, that to define as mountainous is a real insult to those who really know what the mountains are and live there all year round. We must be the first to stop defining ourselves entirely as mountainous if we want to give justice to those who really live in the mountains. Depopulation affects almost everyone in the Aosta Valley, except the municipalities of the Plaine, where instead there is a general increase in population. But the difference, and this is the meaning of the law, is that the depopulation that affects small municipalities puts their existence at risk. Losing 100 people in Châtillon is certainly serious, losing 10 in Rhêmes-Notre-Dame is much more serious. Social and economic life is at stake, volunteering is at stake - just think of the Pro Loco, the volunteer firefighters, the Alpini - and politics is at stake, now we always see the same people running for office, if indeed these people are still found. And I want to emphasize this: Municipalities that today no longer have a sufficient critical mass of population to guarantee a life for the community are Municipalities destined to have no future, they are destined to die, because that is what it is about, and how can even a young person invest in a Municipality that has no future? We often make the mistake of looking at the increase and decrease in population in the last ten years alone, obviously these data must be taken into account, but above all we must analyze the trend in recent decades. Emile Chanoux already said in the 1920s: ""I am originally from a country in the Aosta Valley where the depopulation is the most devastating. I can see the powerful sadness of this old country"". In fact, it is from the Unification of Italy that the depopulation of many of our small municipalities and of many upper hamlets of large municipalities began, the data from the various censuses demonstrate this and these are easily found on the Istat website. If we analyze this trend in recent decades, the numbers are merciless, let's take some examples, precisely, starting from the Unification of Italy. In 1861 Allein had 770 inhabitants, now 207; Chamois 322, now 107; Emarèse 495, now 217; Etroubles 1,032, now 478; La Magdeleine 386, now 100; Pontboset 708, now 174; Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 777, now 164; Valsavarenche 639, now 161. These are just a few examples. A phenomenon, as I said, that has distant roots; not simple solutions, but those proposed in the law could be some of these. This proposal in fact addresses one of the aspects that could reverse the phenomenon of depopulation: the fact that living in the mountains costs more and therefore contributions are necessary, and above all tax relief. A proposal that has never claimed to be the solution to the problem, but a proposal that must be, together with others, one of the pieces of the puzzle, a proposal that can allow those who live in the mountains to stay there and those who want to return. Someone might argue that rather than benefits for individuals and families, we need to guarantee services - and I totally agree - but guaranteeing services must go hand in hand with direct economic aid to families and those who want to invest in these small territories. Without people, services cannot be guaranteed, without services, the presence of people cannot be guaranteed. These two issues must go hand in hand. The current results of depopulation demonstrate two aspects: either that the measures adopted to date are not sufficient or that these measures are wrong, because otherwise we would not be here talking about a law against depopulation. At the heart of this proposal is also the cultural aspect, an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is in fact an Aosta Valley in which autonomy no longer makes sense, because this land would become, like many other territories, without specificity; an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is an ""Italian Aosta Valley in all respects"" and we must resist this in any way, in the name of those who wanted the specificity we enjoy today. And here is the linguistic, cultural aspect, of symbiosis with the high lands to be reinvigorated: it is in fact foreseen, for those who decide to return to live in the mountain municipalities, the need to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language and culture, Titsch and Töitschu and Walser culture in the Walser municipalities, as well as a communication campaign of the measures of the law in the French-speaking states and in the German-speaking states only for the Walser communities, because the objective would be to attract new inhabitants from other states, with the aim of changing their lives. And, if you will notice, in the financial coverage of article 4, for the contribution for new residents, the Chéque Montagnard, the amount is absolutely prudential and in perspective, as it is truly a lifestyle choice that requires time in the decision. A real, concrete, improvable proposal, as I have said from day one. A non-trivial articulated that I will now explore in greater depth. Article 1, paragraph 1, states the purpose and object of this proposed law, recalls Articles 31, 37, first paragraph, and 44, second paragraph, of the Constitution. In order to counteract the demographic decline of small mountain municipalities, a measure for the birth rate and a contribution for the inclusion of new residents in small mountain municipalities is promoted, enhancing the linguistic and cultural particularism of local communities. Paragraph 2 guarantees an exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge in order to provide support to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. Article 2, paragraph 1, defines which are small mountain municipalities, i.e. those that on 31 December 2023 have a population of less than 800 inhabitants and where the seat of their municipality is above 650 meters above sea level. Paragraph 2 establishes that the Regional Council, within thirty days of the entry into force of the law, approves the list of municipalities that present the characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 and updates it every three years. Some clarifications are necessary: ​​it is quite clear that finding an objective classification is practically impossible, because there are truly so many aspects that define what a mountain is and what a small municipality is. However, the two indicators identified seemed to be the best for including small, mountainous and not strictly tourist municipalities. In the initial reasoning for the law, the objective was also to include the mountain villages of large municipalities, which must absolutely not be second-rate and which, in many cases, are in the same conditions as small municipalities identified by the law. However, after a passage from Dr. Ceccarelli, head of the Economic and Social Observatory, it emerged that to date there are no disaggregated data on residents by fraction in the hands of the Region, so to date it is impossible to quantify any possible burden deriving from the application of the measures of the law in parts of municipalities, but it is obvious that, in perspective, this data will have to be there and, if there were a law, there will have to be this implementation. Article 3, paragraph 1, establishes the Chèque Valdôtain birth allowance, as a measure aimed at encouraging an increase in births and the valorization of parenthood in small mountain municipalities. Paragraph 2 highlights that the allowance is paid for twelve months, up to a maximum of 5 thousand euros per year in favor of families at the time of the birth of a child and until the child reaches the age of three, or the entry into the family of a minor, through adoption or foster care, up to the age of three. It is then expected that the beneficiaries of the birth allowance are parents residing in a small mountain municipality of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, or who transfer their residence to one of the said municipalities and who receive a total income determined for the purposes of personal income tax of up to 50 thousand euros. A sum that is certainly not trivial, but which serves to provide assistance to the middle class, not only to the less well-off. Paragraph 4 emphasizes that residence in the small mountain municipality must be maintained for at least ten years, under penalty of forfeiture of the birth allowance and the return of the sums received. Ten years is not a trivial number at all, but it is precisely because it is necessary in the basic seriousness to undertake this type of life choice that this number was chosen. Article 4, paragraph 1, establishes an incentive for new residents in small mountain municipalities, the Chèque Montagnard. A financial contribution for three years equal to 5 thousand euros per year is provided for families who transfer their residence to a small mountain municipality in the Region and maintain it for at least 10 years. Paragraph 2 includes the requirements that the members of the family unit must possess: be Italian citizens or citizens of a member state of the European Union, or stateless or foreigners with a regular residence permit; earn a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and at least two members of the family unit must be under 70 years of age on the date of requesting the contribution, because in any case it would not make sense to encourage the arrival of pensioners who could certainly give less value to small municipalities in the future. Paragraph 3 states that, for those who already reside in the regional territory, in order to move and have access to the contribution, the municipality of origin must have a population of no less than 3 thousand inhabitants on 31 December 2023, because obviously residents must not be stolen from each other between small municipalities or municipalities of not so large dimensions within the Valley. Paragraph 4 establishes that in order to access the contribution, the requesting family unit must declare and demonstrate that the property located in the municipality of new residence (whether owned or deriving from a loan for use rental agreement or other equivalent title) is intended to be the habitual residence for the entire period of enjoyment of the benefit. Paragraph 5 emphasizes that the amount of the contribution referred to in Paragraph 1 is doubled if the requesting family units start a business activity in the small mountain municipality of their new residence, including through the recovery of real estate assets of the historical and artistic heritage, while paragraph 6 emphasizes that the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 can be combined with the birth allowance referred to in Article 3. The cultural and linguistic aspect, with a view to integration into the local community, is central in paragraph 7, in fact, for the purposes of obtaining the contribution, all members of the family unit aged between 7 and 69 years of age, who are not affected by disabilities, pursuant to the provisions in force, must attend, within the first two years of transferring their residence to a small mountain municipality, a course in Franco-Provençal and Franco-Provençal culture, in Töitschu and Titsch of Walser culture in the Municipality of Issime/Eischeme and Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. Paragraph 8 specifies that the Regional Council, within 60 days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, identifies the methods of organizing the course of that paragraph 7, including the bodies and associations authorized to teach. It is essential on the one hand to integrate and on the other to strongly stimulate the population that already resides in a small municipality of the importance of their languages ​​and cultures. Article 5, paragraph 1, establishes that the Regional Council, within sixty days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, regulates the criteria and methods of assigning the birth allowance with article 3 and the contribution referred to in article 4, as well as in agreement with the CPEL, the competences regarding the related controls. Paragraph 2 emphasizes how local authorities have the possibility of integrating with their own resources the amount of the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article four, while paragraph 3 highlights that the CPEL and the small mountain municipalities ensure the support activity to promote the dissemination of information regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4. Paragraph 4 deals with the communication aspect, in fact the Region, also through its instrumental bodies, must promote a communication campaign regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4 in the French- and German-speaking states of the European Union. The communication campaign in the German-speaking states is aimed at encouraging the settlement of new German-speaking families only in the Walser municipalities of Issime/Eischeme, Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. All this is absolutely fundamental to always maintain a living identity from a cultural point of view and above all a specificity, in particular, towards the Walser Municipalities. Article 6 deals with a measure conceived to give help to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. A first step towards a great objective, a greater tax relief for those who live in the mountains and who evidently have additional costs that must be counterbalanced. In paragraph 1, in fact, for the tax period 2024/2025/2026, even if the measure would then become structural, subjects with a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and who live in small mountain municipalities, are exempt from paying the regional IRPEF surcharge. For the first time, I believe, the issue of tax relief in some areas, only in some areas, which have higher costs, is addressed in a systematic way. A path, I believe, that should be followed. Article 7 inserts the evaluation clause, while article 8 defines the financial provisions. Here, I will dwell for a moment on the financial provisions, because those who have studied the law in depth will have wondered why they are so long. Based on the data received by Dr. Nuvolari at the end of February 2024, relating to the money allocated but not yet committed to the various missions and programs, in-depth work has been carried out to find the coverage. A law concerning local authorities - someone suggested to me - should have been based on the resources of current transfers to local authorities. Well, I was totally opposed to this, because local authorities are not rolling in gold and because, if the law were approved, in perspective a whole series of services would have to continue to be maintained or services would have to be implemented, so cutting funds from current transfers to local authorities would have been wrong. An attempt was then made to find funds by touching various missions in the least impactful way possible, with the aim of avoiding people saying: ""With this law, however, funds for health, education, public works are being cut"" and so on. I hope this effort was appreciated, the effort of not making banal, simplistic arguments about finding resources, in order only to make the numbers add up, but an in-depth study that would allow an attempt to find funds that were as fair and as little impactful as possible. Then, indeed, there was the political will to move forward... the resources could easily have been found in other missions and other programs. The opinion on the financial coverage of the law, given on October 7, was negative but then again what could one expect after the law was discussed seven months after the appointment of the rapporteur on April 11? It is therefore obvious that the resources had already been spent. This was, in short, the proposed law. I thank my colleagues from the League for their support, the offices that have done a truly important job and also the majority Councilors who, by voting against this law in the Commission, allowed its discussion in the Chamber."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,4,4696,"I speak on behalf of the Rassemblement Valdôtain group. We waited with a certain curiosity for the debate in the Commission on the text of the law proposed by our colleagues from the League to understand what the majority's position was and above all to understand if there were any developments regarding the proposed rule and its articulation. Why do I say this? Because we have worked on the subject, so much so that we had also presented an inspection initiative and we expressed doubts in the Commission that led to abstention, doubts regarding the possibility of applying this rule and above all the opportunity to coordinate it with a text of state law that was presented precisely by Rassemblement Valdôtain and amended in the first Commission, producing a Commission text. We learned today of the absence of amendments, perhaps in light of how the majority positioned itself in the Commission, which expressed a negative vote. From our point of view, this rule - which we appreciate, because we appreciate the effort and the will of our colleagues from the League - could have been more ambitious, much more ambitious, it could have foreseen a connection, as we said, with the rule that provides for the establishment of mountain free zones, it could also in light of what the rapporteur said in a correct and honest manner ... it did not have the ambition of being a solution to the problem and it addresses one of the aspects that could, together with many others, produce a reversal or facilitate a reversal of depopulation. It is clear that, compared to the data that our colleague has proposed to us, depopulation in recent decades and even much more has been significant, we limit ourselves to looking at the trend of recent years, as he said, and this is already significant. The habits of the people of the Aosta Valley have changed, their lifestyles, their ambitions, the way of undertaking the mountains have changed, but we have doubts about the definitions, the proposed definition and it is difficult to apply, ""Above 650 meters, with a certain population below"", however, as has already been said, the entire Aosta Valley is considered a mountain area. There are differences, but can we say that a municipality below 600 meters, which however experiences a phenomenon of significant hydrogeological instability, a marked economic backwardness, is not worthy of using this rule? Can we say that a municipality at 500 meters - with objective difficulties regarding tourist flows, the promotion of the territory - is not worthy of using this rule? It is very difficult. It is very difficult to say who may be inside, included in the rule or not, but above all what we believe is appropriate to verify and do is to coordinate the new text, such as the one proposed by colleagues, with the existing texts, with what is already being implemented in the mountains, and this is an important thing. We mainly value the productive aspect, how can we say that agriculture is not important in the mountains? This text does not talk about agriculture, perhaps because it is already included in other texts, but, in certain mountain areas, it is important to value agriculture, it is important to exempt from taxes as proposed by colleagues, but the rule on the mountain free zone that we proposed also concerns other types of taxes, it concerns IRAP, it would be important to coordinate it with this rule. We see, in this proposal, an interesting proposal, but one that must necessarily evolve. Our group is working on measures to propose, we have also worked on a text to propose, we were waiting for today's discussion, we are waiting for the budget, we are checking what may be cooking in the pot, we are maintaining a high level of attention on this rule, on this topic, as I think colleagues from all political forces do, including the Government. We believe a rule is necessary, there are other Regions that have already done so, I am talking about at least six Regions: Veneto, Trentino, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Piedmont and Lombardy. We believe that the Aosta Valley must produce an important text on the topic, it must not leave anyone behind, but above all it must allow us to highlight, to bring to the attention of the Regional Council all the particularities of our region, which do not depend on population density and quota, but must consider other problems, other particularities. The colleague will express his opinion regarding the group's vote, I leave these considerations to the Council, believing that I have given the opportunity to reason, especially with a view to the future, on what we can perhaps do together."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Jordan,Corrado,1973.0,M,UV,6,4762,"In addition to what has been said, we believe that it is necessary for the Regional Council to work on these measures, to promote living in the mountains, to promote our Municipalities, the Municipalities of the region that can be considered, as has already been said, marginal. The demographic crisis, depopulation and the closure of businesses are all elements that unfortunately involve many Municipalities, therefore situations that must be addressed, as far as possible, with the tools at our disposal, in a strategic vision, with so-called structural policies of longer duration and not with spot or limited interventions. Fighting depopulation in small mountain Municipalities necessarily requires an overall integrated approach, which therefore integrates regional policies with state policies and which considers the needs of local communities and the potential of the territory. I do not believe that there is a miracle recipe to resolve a trend that has multiple causes and that is objectively much more complex than can be highlighted today in this debate. English: I find and we find the proposal presented by colleague Lavy interesting, if only for having made some operational proposals available to everyone, proposals that however must be part of a virtuous process of actions, including bonuses, as foreseen, can be useful, but cannot be considered as structural and systematic actions. Actions that, although complex, can certainly prove more effective. I believe that it is necessary and appropriate that this comparison be in-depth and integrated with the proposals that were illustrated here in the Commission, on the occasion of the discussion on the application of the free zone, but also, and I add, all the initiatives that, in the institutional sphere, but also external to the institutions, I refer to the University, to the system of trade union organizations, must be put into common factor: all initiatives that in some way can contribute to helping us find the right recipe. And I also add that it is necessary to inevitably refer to the law on the mountains, currently under discussion in Parliament, and to the interesting initiatives that this law could also introduce for our territory. Only in this way, only later, now it is premature, could we have a complete picture of the opportunities that could be put in place and that should, as I said before, be integrated with the many actions already present in our region, we must not forget it, actions that favor small municipalities. I am thinking of education, the reality of subsidized schools, but also of the policies on the facilities of small ski resorts, the great equalization in a federalist perspective of regional transfers that see important resources to the smallest municipalities and, again, social policies, which beyond the difficulties that are evident, are important and if we look at the other regions we do not find them so active. As a contribution to the discussion, I indicate some actions that could be the object of an overall analysis that, in part, are already implemented and are effective, but in some cases could be further developed. It is clear that it would be important to be able to include tax breaks for individuals and legal entities, we talked about it in previous interventions - and the regional surtax is not enough, it would be necessary to do more, but the matter is a state competence, as my colleague Lavy said, and it needs to be explored - or with actions related to taxes and duties on housing, but here there is a significant problem of financial coverage. We must promote coworking spaces and improved connections, internet connectivity in marginal areas must be distributed, this is to promote smart working, support remote working for residents or for owners of second homes. We must further promote the improvement of the quality of life in relation to essential services in healthcare, with territorial structures and with telemedicine, I might add. We must further incentivize policies for the renovation of unused properties, as well as imagine policies to support housing in these areas, or even territorial marketing campaigns, to attract new residents and new tourists, focusing on an image of quality of life linked to the mountains and nature. Finally, and I am aware that I have not made an exhaustive analysis, collaborations between local authorities are useful, indeed necessary, in order to define inter-municipal networks of services to share resources and develop common projects."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,8,4731,"We have already read the proposal of our colleagues from the League some time ago and we have also listened with interest to the report by our colleague Lavy, a report in which, even in the text accompanying the law, we appreciated the in-depth analysis that was made of the situation that concerns many Municipalities in our region. It is an in-depth, timely analysis, we can see that there is work behind it, even serious work of in-depth analysis, and we recognize that there has been an effort on your part in presenting this proposed law, in which we see, however, some elements of weakness that raise, also on our part, doubts. The first concerns precisely the identification of the Municipalities that are included in the list of those that would benefit from the proposed measures, and - as our colleague Lavy also explained - a synthesis has been found between the parameters relating to the number of inhabitants less than 800 units and the location of the town hall above 650 meters. This leads to having, in this list, Municipalities that are extremely different and that can hardly even be considered with regard to the critical issues, the risks, the economic situation. I'll give you an example: the situation between Pontboset and Torgnon is certainly different, because we know very well - and the population data that my colleague Lavy cited also say so - that it is not so much a question of inhabitants, but of the development or non-development situation that leads these two realities - I'll give you just this example - to be very different. I live in one of the Municipalities that would be included in the list and I must say that there are some other doubts: my colleague Lavy also said that a system had to be found also with regard to concrete aid, therefore contributions, or the system of services. We believe that a bill that really intervenes and helps the realities of these Municipalities should focus, rather than a series of contributions, on the introduction or implementation, because it is not that there are no services, but the implementation of services. Then there is an aspect that we do not think is so easy to apply, for example the condition that must be respected to maintain what you have called Chèque Valdôtain and the other related to births, the Chèque Montagnard. It is said that the sine qua non condition is that the residence in the municipality where this contribution was obtained must be maintained for ten years. Now we know that there is a dynamic of population movements that is very strong; I am talking about the municipality where I live, which I know well: we have very fast population movements, people who come, children who attend school for a period and then move, and I do not believe that the possibility of having these 5 thousand euros for the birth of the child or for residence in the municipality, can constitute a strong attraction and a motivation to remain in that territory over time. As for Chèque Montagnard and Chèque Valdôtain, it is then said that it would be necessary for each new family unit that decides to move to one of the small mountain towns to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language or culture or Titsch or Töitschu language. I believe that it is already very difficult - I am thinking above all of people who come from distant countries, but not only - to create the conditions for there to be a possibility of daily communication, therefore of knowledge of the Italian or French language, and I think that learning our languages ​​and dialects must also be something linked to a desire for integration that some people have. I am referring to my reality, we have people who are of Romanian or Moroccan origin who speak patois very well, but it was not an imposition, they learned it by being with the population, creating bonds and also having a personal desire for integration, for knowledge of the territory. A course imposed on each family unit that would come to reside in these towns seems a bit forced to us. Same issue for the birth allowance, which is like the other. While appreciating the effort that has been made and sharing some of the assessments that have been made, because it is certainly a problem, the one we have of the depopulation of the mid-mountain, we think that perhaps the reflection should be broader, more articulated and focus on a range of services that must be guaranteed to those who have decided, voluntarily or involuntarily, to continue living in the mountains or to come and live in the mid-mountain, for which our vote will be a vote of abstention."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Chatrian,Albert,1975.0,M,UV,10,7725,"I join in thanking you, colleague Lavy, for the work that has been done and allow me to reason a little on this bill, but above all on the architectural system proposed by the colleague. We must look at ourselves honestly, around this hall there is a completely different Valle d'Aosta compared to the numbers and steps that have been taken also in relation, so we absolutely must know our history, we absolutely must know our potential, and there is a lot of it, but we must also have the ability to accompany the process on our legislative level: what has been done, what is being done but above all what can or must still be done. There is certainly room, if today we are addressing this issue in this way it is because with regard to a whole series of measures, laws, support, with regard to identity and also culture, despite everything, we can say it - it is not a nice word perhaps - but we have held firm. If we look at our neighbor Piedmont, if we look at our neighbor Lombardy, their lateral valleys, I think we have been quite good, but probably we absolutely must have that ability to find other solutions. To find other supports - but I don't put the economic issue at the center, not the financial issue - I put the quality of life at the center. The proposed law is ""Urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities"", whether they are small, medium or somewhere in between doesn't matter. I think the most important challenge is to guarantee services 365 days a year, because then the risk - and I'm talking about where I live, where I absolutely know more - is that the high tourist lands are guaranteed all the services for nine months, but that in those other three months they are practically ghost towns. The medium tourist lands perhaps manage to guarantee a whole series of public or private services for 12 months, but with many difficulties, but then we have a medium mountain that perhaps - I remember the passage my colleague made before - suffers more than the others, because it doesn't have that tourist potential and, therefore, doesn't have, either in season or out of season, a whole series of services that the other two elements I highlighted have. In all of this, undoubtedly, I think the most delicate part is that linked to work-family balance. What is the goal to create those conditions so that families, new or not, decide to live and not survive in the high or medium mountains? It is to be able to reconcile work... I open a parenthesis: in the high lands there is a lot of it in the two seasons, I close the parenthesis. In the intermediate lands, therefore in the medium mountains, it is more delicate, but there we can work in a different way with transport and on this I open another parenthesis: it seems to me that the efforts that are being made as a public are truly important efforts, I highlight this knowing very well the efforts that the public is making but, despite everything, today, for a family that lives in a medium mountain, or in the high lands, and does not have a private means, I assure you that it is not easy, if the work is not on site, to reconcile family and work. I have given examples that we all know, but perhaps every now and then it is also important to repeat them and highlight them. Returning to the issue, I repeat, some ideas are interesting within this system, but they must then be accompanied... one has already been said by other colleagues: by the law of the mountain, which we hope will find at a political mountain level, by those who at least know these territories and these needs... and, on the other hand, by the implementing rule that will give us the possibility of going, why not, to regulate further with measures and with tools that are also innovative, also of an economic-financial nature, but I put them as a last resort, because perhaps the most important challenge on our more political level is to succeed in getting that message across related to the fact that it becomes an important lifestyle choice but different from the central axis of the main valley which is the one that goes from Pont-Saint-Martin to Courmayeur. In all this we cannot hide, colleague Lavy, perhaps you are a lover of numbers like me, but then, when you know the numbers, you have to find solutions to the critical issues. We have a declining demographics that is very strong, in 2012-2013-2014 the births in Valle d'Aosta were about 1,300, today the births in Valle d'Aosta in the last two years are about 700; it is a further element: despite all the efforts that we are making as an Autonomous Region, these are undoubtedly raw data, but that not only must make us reflect, but that must spur us to find further solutions. I end by saying that on this basis, on the fact - hopefully in the short term - that the law on mountains can be approved at a national level, that we can put together, in any case, all those measures that are currently included in various regional laws. We will be approving the 2025-2026 budget in a few weeks... the dignity that this majority, and I hope that other political forces will also approve those articles... we give certainties again to the system of local authorities; local authorities, municipalities, which guarantee a good part of the services in the territories, local authorities that provide those services above all you mentioned the small, medium or slightly larger municipalities of medium and high mountains. Without these tools, I think that today our lateral valleys would be similar to those of Piedmont and, alas, similar to those of Lombardy. You have reported very well within the report, taking us back to 1860-1870, when Magdeleine and Chamois had X inhabitants; I live in Torgnon and La Magdeleine has less than 100 inhabitants, Chamois does not reach 100 inhabitants, and Torgnon and Antey together barely reach 1,000 inhabitants. to give some examples. English: Earlier, my colleague Minelli, rightly, highlighted the difference between a Pontboset and a Torgnon, but I would not wage war on the poor and would try to find solutions to prevent people from surviving in the middle or high mountains, but to be able, instead, to succeed together in guaranteeing that quality of life - which in the end is our role, that of creating the best laws, legislating to achieve those specific objectives - so that people, families decide to make drastic choices, because, I assure you, by just putting together the main ones - services, transport, school, health, sport, aggregation policies, local authorities, work and work-life balance (I've listed eight) - if one stops only at the economic-financial issue, if there were all the measures that we as a Region put in place, I think that our valleys would be completely different. Despite this, we can probably make a further effort, a further push, it would be nice to be able to do it together, this can also be an interesting starting point, intertwining proposals that are also innovative, but, if I can give you some advice, colleague Lavy, let's put aside the exclusively fiscal, economic, financial issue, I assure you that the most important part is - in my opinion, our point of view also as a group - to be able to improve the quality of life of the people who choose to stay anyway, because many, often, love the mountains, Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, but living there 365 days is a lifestyle choice."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,12,2822,"I will intervene briefly, also taking up the last cue from colleague Chatrian. I will abstract myself from the fiscal issues, the more economic issues, because I think that this law, with the work that colleague Lavy has done, is a bit of an attempt - which I would also define as original and fully in line with a true autonomist spirit - to also create something new, that is, if we are here, in the end the highest role that we can have as Councilors is precisely that of legislators, therefore an attempt that, I repeat, I consider commendable precisely for this sense of novelty, of originality that is put on the table; also pioneering as an attempt, certainly - all pioneering attempts have their defects, that is, they can certainly have them, and here the colleagues who make notes on some particularities of the law, clearly have their reasons - but, I repeat, it is a pioneering attempt and in this way it should be evaluated. In my opinion, this bill demonstrates considerable interest, also because, in the background, in addition to economic and fiscal issues - on which colleagues are much more knowledgeable than I am, who am a terrifying accountant from that point of view - there are other underlying issues: for example, that of identity, which is a fundamental issue, and which in some way this law touches upon. If we ask ourselves today who the people of the Aosta Valley are, today, in 2024, how can we define the people of the Aosta Valley in 2024, when already starting from the last century, starting from fascism, we had the first waves of migration? Let's think of the Venetians, then let's think of the post-war period with Calabrian immigration, and today immigration from various parts of the world. In this law, therefore, there is an attempt - in my opinion, strong and intelligent - to propose solutions that can favor those who can and want to integrate in the Aosta Valley territory and be part of a community, a community that uses in this case the linguistic medium as a system to make participants, but that is put on the table. I understand the colleague who says: ""Making it mandatory becomes something of..."", but it is an attempt to create cohesion, create a community, on the basis that are our identity characteristics, because French, and perhaps even more Franco-Provençal, is something that we must not lose. In conclusion, practically everything has already been said in the colleague's report, I would like to point out that, with this attempt, our party demonstrates in a certain sense a vitality and a pioneering spirit to present laws that are also new and that, despite some defects, certainly go to signify, on our part, a desire to look beyond the horizons that have been used so far by those who have governed the region in recent years."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,11486,"I thank my colleagues for the debate. I will proceed in order, to try to answer the various questions that have been put on the table, because I knew very well that in the end the tone of the answers would be this, a sort of whataboutism, the need to make a global provision, the need to reflect and that's fine, we go on for years, years and years reflecting, but we see the phenomenon, but, precisely, I will proceed in order, starting with the words of my colleague Restano, who asked if, in some way, this text could not be related to the one on mountain free zones, which we absolutely supported, because it is something interesting, but it has a limit: temporariness, so that if a mountain free zone is applied in a certain territory, it lasts a certain number of years and then the condition remains, it returns to the previous one, because the structural deficits of the territory remain. If you are half an hour away from Aosta, it's not that with the mountain free zone that time is reduced, it still leaves half an hour away, that's how it is; it's certainly very interesting, but the free zone has a temporary nature, so after a certain number of years those measures end. If you wanted to have collaboration, it was possible to do so, because the text on mountain free zones was promoted, I think, in July, if I remember correctly, and this law has been tabled since April, so if there had been the will to talk to each other, this was there. I noticed, and I already said it in the discussion of that law, that you took inspiration from this law, from article 6, the one on the exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge: you put it a little more generally, but this doesn't seem so much like collaboration to me but, more than anything else, and here for the proposed state law - it's certainly an interesting proposal - at least one article was copied a little. On the criteria, it is obvious and I said it first: the criteria are absolutely debatable, that is, who can define what is a mountain and what is not a mountain today? We made an attempt, but where is yours? Because it is easy to say: ""Well, these criteria, 800 inhabitants, 650 meters, are not good, we need to find others"", and what are these others? What are they? It is easy to say, right? Try to write down some and then let's think about it. The first day I arrived at the Commission I said: ""If you have any proposals, make them""; zero proposals, not even one, so don't say that the criteria are wrong, they are not entirely convincing, I am the first to say it, but if you had a better proposal you should have made it. I have not seen any proposals. My colleague Jordan said that this would be a law that has spot and limited interventions: I don't know if the text is clear, it seems so, these measures are structural, therefore, if this law were approved, the measures would last as long as one wants, both contributions and also the additional IRPEF exemption. I included the three-year period because I was forced to include it, because it is necessary to base the tax period on the three-year period, but that measure would also have been structural. Then I agree that the additional regional IRPEF exemption is not enough, I agree, but in the meantime let's start doing this if it is possible and if there is the will, given that there is so much talk about the mountains. As for the question of life choices, the 10 years, the fact of the Titsch and Töitschu Franco-Provençal course: a measure like that, bringing people to live in a context like the mountains, which is absolutely not simple, indeed, it is a serious life choice, very serious... so one knows that, if one decides to come and live in that territory and accesses the contributions, one must stay there for ten years. If one has doubts about not staying, one does not come, period, one does not come, one does not make that choice, one goes somewhere else, one goes to the city and does not make that choice or knows where it is, if one is happy. Same thing for the language course, one knows that one must do it, if one does not want to do it, that's it, one does not come, it is not a problem. This serves to integrate those who come, but also to give us a wake-up call, because we are the first ones not to speak our patois to our children, it is a dramatic thing, and then it is obvious that everything is lost. If the Valdostano is told: ""Look, there's that guy who arrived yesterday, who's taking a course in patois, do you speak it?"", ""No"", perhaps a little bit of pride can arise and they can say: ""No, we have to speak our languages ​​too, it's not like the guy who arrived yesterday has to speak them. Talking about services: the talk about services is absolutely central, but the two things have to go hand in hand. In the 80s (let's put it that way) did we have more or less services than today in the mountain areas? Probably more. We have bank branches - I will make a question regarding banking desertification and so on - but how many more schools did we have? Lots. If 40 years ago we had more services and today there are fewer, it means that services are not the condition for which people remain in the mountains at all costs - it is a very important condition but it is not the only one - so we must act on an aspect that is often not considered here: living in the mountains costs more, just think of the cost of heating, so if we do not meet the needs of those who live in certain areas and have higher costs, it is obvious that someone can decide to leave. Then, again, my colleague Chatrian, you said: ""If we are addressing this issue today, it is because we have held (you used this ugly term, you said it) compared to other regions"", and I totally agree, if we go and look at Piedmont, certain valleys are dramatically empty, there is no one left or almost no one. We are perhaps 20-30 years behind those valleys, if, in some way, today we do not take measures that can reverse the situation, that is the objective we will reach, because - you always said it, colleague Chatrian - demography is an exact science. Today we have so many births, in perspective we could have so many inhabitants, without considering those who then leave, and that is another matter. Surely the issue of services must be brought forward and surely this is a text that cannot be comprehensive, but if we want to wait for a comprehensive text, good luck, it will take us two centuries to put everything in. Let's start with a text... then the interesting thing, and President Testolin also said it in the Commission, when he came, he said: ""Do you have any doubts? On some issues, I am the first to have doubts""; and that is fine, but let's try experimentally to bring forward a law of that kind. Let's choose two-three Municipalities, which perhaps can also have different characteristics, and let's try in some way to experiment with these measures. After five years we will see the results, if there are no results, I am the first to say: ""No, this is the wrong path"", but if we don't even try, let's not come and say that this is something that maybe is useless. Let's try it experimentally, then we'll see, but here there is never the courage to do anything, so we sit on what we are already doing and in the meantime everything falls apart. Because here, talking about mountains, talking about high lands, talking about villages, there are not many, or rather, there are some who are mostly those who still live in these territories and, if we count those who come from more mountainous municipalities, we are no longer many, indeed, we are very, very few. Here, also in terms of future representation, it is obvious that in perspective those who come from the city, those who come from the Plaine, have an increasingly greater electoral and representative weight, therefore those who come from the mountains in the chamber will be fewer and fewer, because, I see, of my generation, there are very few people who live there and who then deal with politics, so in perspective we risk handing over the Aosta Valley - which some say is an entirely mountainous territory - to people who know nothing about mountains. This is an important aspect, therefore, either we do something now, even with strong, experimental measures, otherwise we raise the white flag, consider Piazza Chanoux a mountain, because someone will end up saying this, by now in certain parameters Aosta is considered entirely mountainous. For goodness sake, some hamlets yes, they are, but Aosta is not mountainous, I'm sorry. I will still reserve some considerations in the declaration of vote, perhaps, because we have many paradoxes. For example, we have a deputy from the Union Valdôtaine who proposes a motion in Parliament for the internal areas and the mountainous areas. All right, we are all capable of proposing motions, but then I would like to understand what he thinks of this proposed law, to understand if it could be interesting or not. The fact that I noticed, because obviously it is not that once I presented the proposed law I was there sleeping, I went around and went to 23 Municipalities, to 23 Mayors, who were in fact protagonists of this proposed law. Some of these, who then surprised me, were surprised by the fact that for the first time, in the span of their government of the Municipality, there was a Regional Councilor who went to visit them - something that sincerely left me amazed - and all these Mayors have nevertheless expressed great attention towards this law, really great attention, some more than others, for goodness sake, knowing full well that it was not decisive, but then we know that politics acts in certain systems and the CPEL above all acts, we see it: many mayors are the first to complain about depopulation, but then they do not vote for this law. Many mayors are there complaining about the fact that they have deserted centers and then vote against the moratorium that would block the birth of new commercial businesses, so zero coherence on the part of many mayors. But honor to those who instead with pride - because I was told that some did not flatten out, as many do - to an opinion of the CPEL proposed by some Mayors, in a very strong way, expressed themselves against that opinion of abstention of the CPEL, saying that this law could be a tool to combat the phenomenon of depopulation. Honor to these mayors who truly have courage, because we all know very well that not falling into line in certain circles, when there are certain proposals, is not at all simple. This was a complex bill, which touches on one of the aspects of the depopulation of the mountains, which I called a puzzle; this is a piece of the puzzle, and everyone said that it is made up of interesting measures. So I say to myself: but why not try it? Because either you tell a lie, saying that they are interesting measures and you do not consider them as such, or you fill your mouth with words and then, in practice, when there is something different, parallel to the discussion of services and so on, you do nothing. The doubt is that if this proposal had been made by a majority Councilor, probably all these doubts, all these conspiracy theories, all these ""Eh, but a general evaluation is needed"", these reasonings would not have been made. This is a doubt, for goodness sake, I know very well that it does not work that way. I have finished, I will save myself for the declaration of vote."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,16,5844,"The President will also speak, I will limit myself to a few observations, starting of course from what has already been said, that is, the difficulties, we all know what happens, but fortunately we are not at year zero, because, thanks to autonomy, our territory, despite all its limitations, remains inhabited, remains alive, especially - as has already been done - if we compare it only with the nearby Piedmont valleys: also from a political and administrative point of view, as we well know, they even depend on the metropolitan area of ​​Turin and, if we had not had autonomy, it is very probable that today we would find ourselves in the same and identical situation. The topic that has been raised is interesting and the proposal is also interesting, but it has a whole series of weaknesses, so the reasoning of councilor Lavy is: ""Better a little something than nothing"". I believe instead that, when a line has to be decided, it must be done in a complete manner, and in this regard, in a few minutes, I will try to make some reasoning. I am returning from a meeting on the Alpine macro-region in Slovenia: it is an assembly that certainly needs to be strengthened, it has weaknesses, it was officially born at the beginning of the 2010s and I took the liberty of drawing the attention of my colleagues to ask for greater political commitment and less technocratic vision within the Alpine macro-region, because I believe that the issues that we must address today are four plus one: the first is climate change, which will profoundly modify our territory; the second topic is the energy transition, also considering the ambitious prospects that the Valle d'Aosta Council itself has given itself; the digital revolution, someone mentioned the fact that repopulation also involves techniques such as co-working, and, again, the demographic crisis that, in the Aosta Valley, is actually added to depopulation, that is, the choice that many Aosta Valley residents, since the post-war period, have made to move down, some to the larger municipalities of the valley floor, some instead to the city of Aosta which in the meantime has spread out across what we call the Plaine. Another argument is added that is central to believing that the Aosta Valley is all mountains, which of course does not mean that there can be classifications by area within us; I am not convinced by the altimetry, because someone pointed out that today - as Bernard Janin, the famous geographer, said - those who are most in crisis are those of the medium mountains, if we use the altimetry, we will somehow also facilitate tourist locations where well-being is completely evident. The extra costs are striking, what the University of the Aosta Valley is doing is important, taking up a theme from a few years ago: understanding what the impact of schools, transport, healthcare means; all expenses that weigh heavily on our regional budget and that demonstrate the particularity of the mountain areas that will have to be highlighted, especially when they arrive alongside, or perhaps no longer alongside, differentiated autonomy, the famous LEP. Another scenario: there is a European scenario that we must follow, because we have the same problems: President Kompatscher himself, in a dialogue also with President Testolin, reminded us that they have a high demographic but that has fallen below that percentage of the fertility rate that guarantees a replacement for the population. We are graveyard-like from this point of view. The study by Professor Rosina of the Catholic University of Milan has shown that in 2034 we will have 10 thousand fewer Aosta Valley residents in the intermediate age, that is, the most productive. I would add, because it is very important, that any regional law, which in some way better regulates the particularity of territories higher than the average, must take into account the law on mountains which, with its 28 articles, was approved by the Senate, not because we have to copy it - I am always for original legislation - but because this law allows on the one hand to have a whole series of particularities that can be demonstrated in the legislation of the Regions and autonomous Provinces and, on the other, there are interventions in the matter that are not our competence. I believe it would be interesting to imagine reopening a discussion when we find ourselves faced with a complete text that, among other things, touches on one of the main issues for the Italian mountains, which is the delimitation of mountain areas, because, if there is too much mountain (as happens today in the old delimitations, even from the 1950s) it is very difficult to imagine specific interventions, which are also valid - I remind you in conclusion - for the European Union. With the new President of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, right in Slovenia, we have imagined a European mountain pact, starting with the Alpine mountains, because it is very clear that today in article 174 of the treaties we talk about mountain areas, but that necessary directive that should say what the mountain is, which is then different in the Massif Central rather than in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Apennines, has remained suspended, however a regulation is needed taking into account that many of the matters that we have in article 2 of our Statute of autonomy - I am thinking of agriculture - are basically now linked to decisions that are taken by European politics. It is therefore right to give recognition to the intellectual effort, the legal effort, to arrive at something, however, in all frankness, I believe that the picture is more complex and it can be said that if this was the beginning of a discussion it is good, but it cannot be considered a conclusive phase."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,18,6328,"I believe that following the last intervention of colleague Caveri there is little left to add. I would like to make some considerations of a more strictly related nature to the framework on which this legislative initiative was intended to be inserted; a regulatory framework already quite broad, which we had the opportunity to share also during an inspection activity (recalled by colleague Restano) which underlined how within the evolutionary path and attention to the mountain territory and the difficulties of living there... because one thing is to look for prerequisites and indications to support - even on an ongoing basis, assuming that it is the best way - the population that lives in the mountains to be able to do so at lower costs, another thing is to make it usable in an adequate manner and also in step with the times... also so to speak ""infrastructured"" and also generous with opportunities, especially work and support for one's family in the mountains with adequate services; they are two slightly different concepts and the main aspect is to go and observe how a whole series of initiatives that we had already shared there have tried over time to enhance the characteristics of our mountain, with road safety and with the infrastructure, which started in the 90s, of that backbone that should have brought the optical fiber - and brought it, up to our highest villages. Even yesterday, in an interesting meeting developed within the Department of colleague Caveri, with Infratel some opportunities were outlined that can actually create new potential for those who want to move to the mountains. This is a job that is daily accompanied by specific laws to try to enhance the job offers of our territory. : Colleague Jordan mentioned it, also taking up a track that we had already presented a few weeks ago: from support for ski resorts to mountain schools, transport concessions, special attention also to the size and accessibility of the same, initiatives on neighborhood businesses - to talk about situations that are developed within the Regional Council - but, still, in a broader context, among the opportunities that can be made available to the mountains, there are European resources that, first of all, through the rural development plan and activities related to the agricultural world, have tried to enhance a whole series of historical and traditional activities that maintain opportunities for settlement in our territory even in small municipalities and especially in small municipalities where rightly a company, one, two, five people, a family make the difference, despite what may happen in the valley floor. A situation that is also very complex at a national level, I remember that in the years 2015-2016, when there were the first activities to support marginal areas, paradoxically the case occurred where, for example, Cogne, which is a tourist resort of primary importance for our region, was included in the marginal areas when - now I don't want to be wrong - Avise or Saint-Nicolas, which had slightly different altimetric characteristics and not such a significant percentage drop in population as that of Cogne, was not included. Two paradoxes that, if we go to see the two locations, give you a feeling of mountains that is not exactly the same. This is to arrive at the fact that there is a network, a series of initiatives and activities that continue to be developed, such as the investments that are advocated in our territory also at the level of ski lifts, but also all those activities that try to bring safety also for those who live in the mountains: we have already mentioned it a couple of times, but I will never tire of saying it: the helicopter rescue rather than the valorization of those ski-mountaineering activities linked to the world of randonnées, which can and must also bring young people - just as you said - to our territory. This must be accompanied - as my predecessor rightly said - by more structured, more structural indications, which on the one hand certainly pass through the law of the mountain, which has been questioned, which provides a guideline on which a regional mechanism of study and adaptation can then be grafted, also to the characteristics and peculiarities of our territory; on the other hand, a law on the free zone that has as its objective not so much to stabilize over time and over the years, over the decades, a support and a contribution, but to create the conditions to relaunch above all an activity in our marginal areas, which is proclaimed and guaranteed, to which the Region will probably have to contribute, in a significant way, with its resources, because let's say that the feeling is rather that we need to clear the principle of being able to identify autonomously, or in any case agreed upon, the areas in which we want to intervene, because evidently - you teach me - Courmayeur rather than Valtournenche perhaps have less need than Rhêmes-Saint-Georges, rather than Lillianes, Gaby or Champorcher, of initiatives that can be developed on their territory with significant help, limited perhaps in time but which can allow the activation of initiatives in these territories that can then give legs to a virtuous circle that can bring interest back to our territory. This is what we had already said a bit in the Commission, net of other technicalities relating to what is coverage, not coverage. However, it remains, not out of respectability, the fact of recognizing the initiative as having a transversal consensus, which I think was also demonstrated by the colleagues who spoke; I also appreciated the fact that he underlined the negative vote that nevertheless allowed this bill to be brought to the floor and discussed and I believe that the interest is transversal, as has been underlined, and that there will still be time and a way to work carefully especially on those two elements that can really make a difference in this context."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,20,3096,"I thank the speakers and proponents of this bill, the 138 of the League. Bill 138 represents an attempt to address one of the most pressing challenges of mountain communities, which is that of depopulation. The Aosta Valley, like many other mountain regions, is experiencing a progressive exodus of the population from smaller centers to the cities; this phenomenon has significant repercussions on the local economy, on culture and on the valorization of our territories. The proposal aims to reverse this trend through a series of concrete measures, mainly focused on economic incentives, therefore the birth allowance or Chèque Valdôtain, an economic contribution to families who choose to have children in small mountain municipalities, incentives for new residents, the Chèque Montagnard, tax breaks and contributions for those who ask or decide to settle in these territories and the enhancement of the territory through the promotion of local culture, therefore support for traditions and minority languages, the development of sustainable tourism, investments and environmentally friendly tourism activities and the guarantee of basic services such as healthcare, school and transport, we talked about it before. From an initial analysis, the League's proposal presents several strong points, a concrete approach, therefore the proposed measures are specific and targeted to solve the problems, attention to families, therefore: incentives for births, for families with children and an enhancement of the territory. In our opinion, even if the proposal represents a step forward in the direction of a regional policy more attentive to the needs of mountain municipalities, some problems emerge; one of these is economic sustainability: putting these measures into practice requires significant economic resources and long-term effectiveness. Economic incentives can be a first step, but a more structural approach is needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of mountain municipalities; collaboration with local authorities: the success of these measures also depends on collaboration with municipalities, as my colleague Chatrian pointed out. To reach a conclusion, the Lega's bill 138 represents an important contribution to the debate on the enhancement of mountain areas, raising a topic of great importance and future for our region, however it is important to underline that the problem linked to the phenomenon of depopulation cannot be solved only with economic incentives, we have said and reiterated several times that a series of long-term territorial development political actions are needed, which take into account all the actors involved in order to achieve concrete and lasting results. Assuming that this bill could also be amended in order to improve it and make it more suitable to the needs of our community, we as a group appreciate the work and for this reason we will vote for it."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,22,4170,"Thank you, Mr President, for the final considerations that emerged after the Government's reply. I don't know if Councillor Caveri has actually read ""Tradition et renouveau"" by Janin because otherwise, I don't know, he probably wouldn't have made certain arguments... (Interruption off microphone by Councillor Caveri.) ...It is absolutely not offensive, far from it. The issue of altimetry, for goodness sake, is debatable, but I would perhaps invite you one day, indeed, to live a little, to go to Marine di Perloz: I would like to see if that isn't a mountain. It's not a high mountain, for goodness sake, but it is a mountain. Then the issue of climate change is fine, it is obvious that we are facing epochal challenges, as there have always been throughout history, for goodness sake, today we have new ones and therefore we must rightly adapt. The issue of additional costs, which you brought up - if you were offended before, now I give you credit for bringing up an issue that is essential - the issue of additional costs is central, I said it: living in the mountains costs more, and that is why I believe that there is a need for economic help, on the one hand with contributions, on the other with tax relief, things that are proposed by this law, so, for goodness sake, do you not understand 100% how? All right, but, as I said before, where is your proposal? The issue of demography, which was also touched upon earlier by my colleague Chatrian: ""Eh, but this law talks about a birth allowance"", more demography than that... so you can say anything, but not that this law does not touch on the issue of demography. Then President Testolin, as usual, glosses over it a bit... but the thing I'm thinking about - and in my notes I had the answer you gave to colleague Restano, when I mentioned law 17 and various laws - is that it doesn't seem to me that in these laws there is a specific part for mountain areas. There are laws that apply to all areas, so if we take law 17, those who have a farm in the valley bottom and those who have a farm at 1,500 meters benefit from it. It's obvious that it's a law that also helps those who live in the mountains, it's not a law that's only made for those who live in the mountains and that compensates for the extra costs of those who live in the mountains; that's the point. Our laws are not diversified, they are the same for everyone, on the one hand that's fine, on the other hand I think we also need to reflect, but then it's not that those laws only help those who live in the mountains. I really, to conclude, because I understood that there is none, I would really like you to go for a tour of many villages in our municipalities, around the Valley, all the municipalities have villages that are now abandoned, or almost, and there you will understand the roots of depopulation, really. Go to the valleys and talk to those who remain and who will explain to you that their son has decided to leave, maybe not even abroad, he has come down. You will understand from these people the reason why people leave: the extra costs - you said it, Councilor Caveri - and those villages there, if it goes well, will become second homes, if it goes badly, they will be ruined. It is this policy of saying ""We are already doing"" that kills those villages, that kills planning. Let's question ourselves for once, it is not possible to say ""We are already doing, everything is fine"", look at the valleys of Piedmont, we all see the valleys of Piedmont, but if we continue like this, we too will get to the valleys of Piedmont. Let's question ourselves, let's bring forward measures that can also be experimental, the free zone issue is absolutely positive but it's not enough, it's not enough! Do you know when we will no longer talk about depopulation? When the last elder of the last village has passed away, then there will no longer be the problem of depopulation, because there will no longer be anyone living in the Aosta Valley. The fact that there was no will to reason in a concrete way on a text of law and that this law has favorable, interesting principles, but that are not enough, is truly a stab in the back to those who live in the mountains."

If before I highlighted the side of the autonomist spirit that distinguishes this proposed law, on the other hand I simply want to underline, as I said before, beyond the economic factor, an element that strongly characterizes our political force, that is the League, because this is, from another point of view, the attempt to attract to our territory, in particular to the mountain area, an immigration that can be chosen, an immigration that can be sustainable, in contrast to those who instead claim or think that anyone can come to our territory, even when they have attitudes or cultures or mentalities that are difficult to integrate with our millenary culture. I repeat, a law perfectly in line with our party that sees and thinks that those who can come to our territory and feel and become fully-fledged Aosta Valley citizens must be people who have the tools to integrate; in this case it would be the regional body itself that provides tools from a linguistic point of view, which is fundamental. From this point of view, therefore, I believe that it is a bill that is a real shame to remain there, but I think that it will remain, in any case, in the archives and one day, when perhaps historians will look back and listen to the debates of this Council, they will be able to see who had at least the courage to propose something, even on an experimental basis, because my colleague said it very well: even on an experimental basis, rather than settle for and adapt to dynamics that we cannot control without making an effort, perhaps even wrong, perhaps that does not work, but an effort that represents a novelty towards phenomena of great importance and that unfortunately we are unable to govern. I believe that this is a real shame, but, I repeat, whoever proposed something new and had the courage to do so will remain in the annals, while, on the other hand, whoever perhaps made criticisms, had good intentions, then on the table, however, never put anything innovative."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Cretier,Paolo,1963.0,M,FP-PD,26,1244,"I will be very brief given the time and the discussion that has taken place on this law presented by my colleague Lavy, who must be given credit for the commendable effort he has put into proposing this law, which however cannot be supported: in our opinion there are too many difficulties, as already expressed, from a financial, fiscal, etc. perspective, but above all imposing a course within the first two years seems to me to force and really oppress a free choice to live in a community, creating first-class citizens and second-class citizens, and also thinking that some immigrants, for example, could be advantaged: all those who come from French-speaking countries, probably and rightly, would have a benefit, so I believe this is an element to be evaluated. However, it is difficult to answer the question I am asking: ""Whether economic aid can affect the life choices of the family and in particular of our children"". I believe that there are other values, for example the love of the mountains, of culture, of traditions, that cannot be monetized, even at the cost of sacrifices, then tomorrow everything will surely change. Regarding the issue of citizens, I point out: before the Constitution we are all equal."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8009,"The upcoming introduction of fifth-generation mobile phone technology, hereinafter of course referred to as 5G, will give rise to new scenarios of population exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, which will be placed in frequency bands, 694-790 MHz, 3.6-3.8 GHz and 26.5-27.5 GHz, different from those currently used for mobile telephony, from 800 MHz to 2.6 GHz. One of the particularly novel aspects of 5G is that it will not only be aimed at communication between people, but also at the so-called Internet of Things, in which various wireless devices communicate directly with each other, using in particular electromagnetic waves of frequency belonging to the 26.5-27.5 GHz band, often referred to as millimetre waves, even if the latter correspond more precisely to frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz, wavelengths between 1 and 10 mm. Electromagnetic waves of such high frequency, during their propagation, they cannot penetrate buildings or overcome obstacles and are also easily absorbed by rain and leaves. For this reason, it will be necessary to use, to a greater extent than current mobile phone technologies, the so-called Small Cells, areas of land covered by the radio frequency signal whose dimensions, which can range from about ten meters indoors to a few hundred meters outdoors, are much smaller than those of macro cells, which can extend up to several kilometers. This will require the installation of numerous antennas and this proliferation of antennas is one of the main causes of concern among the population about possible health risks associated with 5G electromagnetic emissions. Following the 2013 IARC assessment, which defined radio frequency electromagnetic fields as possible carcinogens due to the effects on head tumors linked to prolonged use of cell phones, numerous studies have been conducted that have investigated the associations between long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields and various health problems, oncological and otherwise. Exposures not resulting from the use of mobile phones but from other sources, such as SRB radio base stations, are of a different nature, especially because the possible effects are not limited to the head and, as appears from monitoring studies, are of lesser intensity. To date, studies on the health effects of exposure to radio base stations provide conflicting results. Furthermore, due to emission limits, 62% of existing sites in urban areas would not be upgradeable to 5G and the extra costs, to create coverage, would amount to approximately 1.3 billion euros per operator. To maintain 6 Volts per meter, an expense of approximately 4 billion euros per year is estimated, a decidedly high cost for telephone companies. It should also be emphasized that 5G emissions combine with other forms of electromagnetic emissions, all with the consequences that such emissions can have on both health and the environment. A group of Swedish researchers have published the world's first study documenting the immediate effects of 5G radiation on human health. These are groups of people who, between 2023 and 2024, began to feel ill immediately after the installation of new 5G antennas near their homes, precisely at a distance of between 3 and 538 meters. In some cases, the symptoms were so severe that they forced people to move elsewhere. The research was conducted by oncologist Dr. Lennart Hardell of the Swedish Foundation for Environment and Cancer Research, known for epidemiological studies on tumors among cell phone users, in collaboration with Mona Nilsson of the Swedish Foundation for Radiation Protection. The researchers measured the electromagnetic field in the homes of those who complained of 5G-related health problems and documented that 5G involves a significant increase in pulsed radiofrequency radiation compared to previous generations of mobile telephony. The people studied had been living near cell phone towers for years, but had never complained of disturbances with the reactions of 2G, 3G and 4G, but they began to feel ill within 24 hours of activating 5G. The Swedish study is particularly innovative, because it documents the health effects of 5G radiation in real conditions of use, while until now there were only studies on the biological effects of the different frequencies of 5G. : The biological effects of radiation are not only related to the power density, which gives information about its intensity and is responsible for heating, but are also determined by the quality of radiation, namely its pulsation, polarization and remodulation. The most common symptoms that were found in the people in question were sleep disturbances, tiredness, headaches, irritability, concentration problems, short-term memory impairment and skin problems. These are the same symptoms described more than 50 years ago as microwave syndrome or radiofrequency sickness. In all the cases observed, the radiation levels were lower than the levels considered safe by international standards; these in fact protect only from the effects of immediate heating of radiation, namely thermal effects, and not from other biological effects that are due to the interference of the external electromagnetic field with that of living systems, and therefore non-thermal effects. Confirming the role of 5G radiation is also the observation that the irradiated subjects, once moved to another house with lower radiation levels, felt better; symptoms were reduced and in most cases disappeared completely after a short period. In Italy, exposure limits are measured over an average of 24 hours and not 6 minutes, as is the case throughout the world. The 6-minute interval is the biological time needed for cells to dissipate the heat produced by radiofrequency radiation through blood circulation. It is therefore a time necessary to protect cells from the effects of heating produced by the electromagnetic field. This choice was made in 2012 by the Monti Government, which increased the average measurement of radiofrequency radiation from 6 minutes to 24 hours, with the aim of diluting the measured values ​​and effectively increasing the limits of radiofrequency radiation. It is therefore clear that, with the growing use of these technologies, studies conducted by third-party bodies with respect to the Regional Administration are necessary, in the name of transparency and full accessibility of information to the community, in order to guarantee the population clear information, especially in the case of installing new antennas near schools, hospitals and residential areas. Moreover, the European Council itself, with a recommendation of 12 July 1999, in act 519 EC, provided at point 6 that Member States should promote research programmes in order to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendations and efforts of community and international research. With this motion, we therefore ask the Regional Government to activate, through funding to be explicitly provided for this purpose, a system of overall study and monitoring of the impact on human and environmental health of the entire system of infrastructures, networks and their emissions that will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, in order to guarantee and protect the health of the Aosta Valley people."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,4159,"Our group shares the need for digitalization that exists for our country and obviously also for our region. The spread of ultra-wideband throughout the national territory, both with fiber and with 5G, where an alternative is not possible, can serve to fill a gap, that of the Digital Divide which is undoubtedly a gap in our territory. But this must happen, in our opinion - or rather, it had to happen - without changes to the limits of exposure and precautionary attention in the face of risks or potential health risks that, with the increase, can obviously manifest themselves. Currently the limit has been set at 15 Volts per meter, by the competition decree in 2023, and previously it was 6 Volts per meter, so we are talking about more than doubling, and it is a limit that has generated quite a few controversies, because there is no valid reason to raise the value of attention for electromagnetic fields generated by high frequencies, other than the economic one, obviously on the part of telecommunications operators, who intend to save on the costs of their infrastructures. It is a threshold that has been assumed without a real scientific basis and there are strong concerns that have been expressed from many sides, truly many; I will mention only one, because it is the one that, among the many that I have read, also seemed most convincing to me and that is that of Dr. Belpoggi who was for a long time the scientific director of the Ramazzini Institute in Bologna which, as we know, is an institute that deals with cancer prevention. She is currently the scientific director of ISDE, the Association of Doctors for the Environment. Dr. Belpoggi, in a recent publication, stated: ""What will change is the power density, that is, the energy absorbed by our body, which will increase sixfold. Today, Italy wanted to align itself with other European countries, raising its limit, but then why hasn't it also aligned itself with the measurement times? It's true that the limit considered safe is 61 Volts per meter, so we are at 15, which is much lower, so theoretically we should be calm, but the fact is that in other European countries, which also have higher limits than the Italian one, these values ​​were measured at the maximum peaks. In Italy, however, they are measured throughout the day, day and night, so the average is also taken into account during the night hours, where telecommunications traffic, as we know, is, if not zero, almost zero"". So what's happening? That the data, in some way, is distorted. From this it is clear that our body, or that of those who are exposed to these peaks, has a higher frequency, I think there is no doubt about this. At the moment, electromagnetic waves remain a topic that is still, in our opinion, too little investigated. Some in-depth studies have been done, but we believe that they are not - on a general level, I mean - sufficient, because being exposed 24 hours a day, especially for some categories of people, I am thinking of children, the elderly, pregnant women, can be dangerous; I use ""Can"" because we do not have very certain data, but it is something that a whole series of scientists tell us, and so why not replace, for example, the large antennas - which have a concentration - with a series of smaller antennas also to dilute this exposure? We could have maintained the 6 Volts that we had until before the change in the situation, but what was needed to maintain them? A very high expense was needed, which has been estimated between 3 and 4 billion a year, a cost that the operators do not want to sustain. So let's welcome the commitment of this motion, which essentially asks for what? It asks for an in-depth analysis and monitoring of the impact on health. We believe that it is right that an activity of this type be activated, even in our region, precisely because this impact of 5G technology is considered controversially by some and others, but having an in-depth analysis can still help to clarify. We will therefore vote on the motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,6,1424,"English: We read with great attention the motion that was presented by the two opposition groups and that brought us back to the motion that we brought to the attention of the Council last May, identifying in Terna's paths the will and the need to carry out a verification and a series of in-depth studies. Even in the Municipality of Gignod, we had evaluated two different situations, one that crossed the Municipalities from Charvensod to Aymavilles and the other that concerned precisely the antenna that will have to be positioned in the Municipality of Gignod; in that motion we had actually asked for an in-depth study, identifying ARPA as the entity that could give us important information regarding a study that must, in our opinion, be done. The commitment therefore that the motion brings to the attention of the Council, that is to carry out an in-depth study on the health of the entire system of infrastructures and networks and their emissions, which will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, is certainly in line with what we think. It is certainly a matter of going deeper and it is above all a matter of giving a minimum of security also to the populations that in some way are close to these plants and that sometimes are solicited by information that can also be misleading. May science give us concrete answers regarding these paths. We will vote with conviction for this motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,8,11501,"I appreciated the speeches of Councilors Manfrin and Minelli, a sign that they have carefully prepared themselves on this complicated topic, and it would be appropriate for many Councilors here in this chamber to deal with it at least a little. I would also like to thank Baccega for his speech. I supported this motion - it could not be otherwise - and in doing so I am addressing in particular the majority of the Council, which is so sensitive to the issues of health and the ecosystem, so resilient in fighting their battle in the name of a cleaner and healthier environment; in particular, responsible fathers who are concerned about the future of future generations. I wanted to tell you that electromagnetic fields are one of the most widespread environmental pollutants, rapidly increasing in the environment, and that they are capable of biological modifications on cells and living organisms, including humans. Magnetic fields are natural, as we know, they control all the vital processes of living beings, therefore molecular movements, cellular oscillations, ionic interactions. Electromagnetic fields are produced by nature, and I am talking about cosmic rays, light energy, geomagnetism of the earth and living beings themselves. The fact is that until 1940 the natural pulsed background was 0.0002 Volts/meter, but in the last century there has been a huge entry of artificial fields at low and high frequencies, so radio antennas, telephones, electric cables, lamps, household appliances, power lines etc. etc., at high frequency, at low frequency, at low frequency but high intensity, etc. etc., the subject is very complex. The level of radiofrequency radiation since 1940, or rather, let's make it shorter, from 1985 to 2005, in 20 years, the level of radiofrequency radiation in industrialized countries has increased 5 thousand times, so 5 thousand times more radiation than human beings, like all living beings, receive. Will it do well? The 5G system was born in the last century in the USA from a research of the military industry for the guidance of tanks, drones, missiles, 3D image visualizations, it works with elements emitting high frequency waves, in the 700 MHz and 27 GHz bands, but it will soon reach 86 GHz, impressive things, with Phased array antennas, which are phased array vectors, I won't make it more difficult, but here is the problem that we would have to deepen the fixed geometry of the currently existing 3G networks, while the 5G network requires a different geometry. All this to say that we are installing a 5G on the fixed geometry of the 3G, this is naturally underused, but these are topics that we hope to address on site with the technicians. In all this, the 5G will operate with much higher frequencies than those used so far and will add to the fields of the current 2G, 3G and 4G, making it difficult for the ARPA to measure the electromagnetic field. It will be necessary to install numerous micro repeaters in urban areas: 250 antennas per square mile are calculated, which corresponds to one antenna every 100 m² approximately, remember, there will be one antenna every 100 m². Today's news: in Milan, a thousand street lamps will see the installation of small cells, which colleague Manfrin was talking about, installed on public lighting poles, A2A will take care of it. What's happening? That the small cells on the street lamps will be at the beginning of a process that will lead to the network, naturally more powerful, more widespread to improve the connection, but residents are already collecting signatures, because this is the first step towards a Smart City model, naturally this to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. But what's happening elsewhere? In Arezzo on October 8, 2024, so I'm talking about a little over a month ago, the Municipality made an about-face. The Municipality of Arezzo has proceeded to draft an order of cancellation ex officio in self-protection regarding the installation of the new radio base station for cellular telephony. The act was consequently entrusted to the technical opinion that highlighted the prevalence of the protection of public health over the provision of mobile telephony services, moreover the area was already covered. ""The antenna must be dismantled"", these are the words of the Municipality, the lack of urgency and urgency were highlighted, as prerequisites for the release of the authorization and the unavailability of the company to find a different solution forced them to this decision. It is therefore decided to proceed with the cancellation ex officio of the authorization act previously granted and, consequently, to order the restoration of the state of the places. The antenna was taken and taken away. Following the example of the Mayor of Cassano Ionio, it is worth remembering: he issued an order requesting a halt to the work, pending the completion of all checks to ensure the protection of the population's health. In Tuscany, you know, on September 22nd, so not even two months ago, the resolution of the Regional Council, signed by the Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, I repeat: the Regional Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, certainly more attentive to the health of their fellow citizens than other mountain areas that we know well, allocated a sum of 222 thousand euros to conduct what is perhaps the first scientific research conducted at a public level, at least in Italy. Tuscany has decided to conduct a study on 5G, six provincial capitals of about 100 thousand inhabitants, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Florence, Prato and Arezzo, or rather, some of much more than 100 thousand, will try to understand what the link is between the tumors suffered by the population, especially children, and the electromagnetic fields generated by the base stations that are springing up everywhere in Tuscany. Up to now the scientific community, as my colleagues who preceded me claimed, has only investigated the aspect of electromagnetic fields, that is, the thermal aspect. The aspect on biological tissues is very different. There will be the two regional agencies that are involved. ARPA Toscana is responsible for measuring exposure to pollution from superfast broadband; among its tasks: analyzing the limits and development scenarios of the 5G network; developing a mathematical model that allows the prediction on an urban scale of the levels of exposure present in the provincial capitals; measuring exposure with the control units already in place and purchasing others; carry out checks on existing 5G systems, possibly from different operators, and on those under construction that are being installed; apply special broadband dosimeters to the systems to measure exposure and evaluate exposure levels where it is highest and where the population density is highest, especially in areas where there are schools, with the presence of children. The ARS, the Regional Health Agency, will instead be responsible for: health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance in cities where slightly higher levels of electromagnetic fields are recorded, the estimates can also be refined within homes and schools; estimate the possible associations between exposure to electromagnetic fields and diseases. ""Based on the limited scientific literature available,"" says the ARS, ""it is planned to focus attention on the child population, as they are more susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic pollution."" What happens to children? It happens that EMFs, that is, electromagnetic fields, have no problem crossing the human body, as demonstrated by the images obtained from magnetic resonance radiology equipment, which show the entry of the field into the human skull upon contact, for example, with a cell phone. This dynamic is at the basis of the pathogenesis of acoustic nerve tumors and areas of brain tissue exposed to the side of contact with the mobile phone. The impressive thing is that in adults, the penetration is a few centimeters, while in a child it passes almost completely through the brain, naturally having a more fragile, lighter base. Doctor Gandus, who was connected recently with Aosta, on the occasion of an evening dedicated precisely to the subject, maintained that the increase in childhood brain tumors is being found in the 2000s and probably one of the causes could be precisely electromagnetic waves. The studies - they were cited by the colleague - are endless, we are talking about more than 10 thousand studies, and we cite the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the study by Prof. Hardell, the National Toxicology Program, the Ramazzini Institute was also cited, etc. etc., but we also have the sentences in court: the TAR of Lazio in 2019 and the TAR of Monza in March 2019 attested the link between electromagnetic fields and cancer beyond any reasonable doubt. What is happening here in Valle d'Aosta, instead? Twice, the Councilor for the Environment replied to me that the data correspond to what the literature and recent studies have documented, but the problem is that there is this institute that carried out these surveys, the ICNIRP, International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection, and it established 61 Volts/meter as the non-worrying level, and it is the measure adopted at European level. The problem is that this institute is considered an authority only by the European Commission, which has given the task to this small private association from Bavaria to draw up the guidelines for limiting exposure. The task was assigned in 1997 and in 1998 these measures were already issued, that is 61 Volts/meter, but the studies - I spoke of more than 10 thousand studies worldwide - support something very different, and that is that already at 0.2 Volts/meter there is interaction with human tissue, so there is certainly a lot to do, there is a lot to investigate. The result is that, in addition to this disaster on land, the 5G project will also arrive from space. A launch into orbit of at least 20 thousand satellites is planned that will cover the earth with adjustable bands from the stratosphere, each one will emit 5 million watts on the ground that will connect to the billions of objects of the Internet of Things, we are talking about cars, televisions, sensors, computers and tablets, it is estimated that already in 2020 there were over 20 billion of these objects connected, making the environment where we live a real microwave oven 24 hours a day, with no escape, without the possibility of turning it off or hiding somewhere else. So let's welcome, let's hope for a little, a little - it doesn't require much - common sense from this Government, let's welcome an in-depth analysis: I must admit that the President of the Third Commission, to whom I asked for the possibility of obtaining hearings by the scientific world in this chamber, has taken action and we should soon agree on these meetings. The request is that the scientific world be listened to and not only the highly respected technicians of ARPA, for whom we have all the due respect, but here we have scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to this research. We have scientists, we have doctors, who daily confront this problem. I would really like to understand what could be the impediment to seriously delve into this topic."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,10,4011,"This time it's my turn because we're talking about pylons, as well as talking about 5G technology. I've heard the well-known theories of those who are against 5G, it's an interesting, anti-modernist movement, which is connected to other anti-modernist theories. I remember the one that said that those who got the vaccine would die, now, making horns, I don't want to die at the end of my speech, but it's quite clear that there are contradictions that I would like to say right away. I understand the position of Councilor Lucianaz, who has always fought, and we must also acknowledge the technical competence that would make the physics degree of colleague Lavevaz envious, but I find that there is a contradiction in the colleagues of the League and in the colleagues of Forza Italia, because it was your Governments, and in particular the Meloni Government, that increased the rate of electromagnetism - as my colleague Minelli recalled with the date of 2023 - just as it is your Government that went back on a legislative decree that would have given some chance to the Municipalities to at least move those pylons that will also be placed in the Aosta Valley. I only have to correct Councilor Minelli: 5G are small systems, the technology is very different. There will be more small pylons compared to the large pylons we have today. So it is difficult today, Councilor Manfrin, to hear the Aosta Valley League - I imagine in a logic of federalism, which I appreciate - saying things that are contrary to what the Government says. The Government has, in fact, liberalized the positioning of pylons, today no one can do anything, neither the Region, nor the municipal master plans, and we will see how the Arezzo issue ends, because it is in the hands of the administrative justice. With the latest regulations that on the one hand have increased the limits of electromagnetic fields in Italy, which remain - I also say this to Councilor Minelli - lower than the European average, but above all with the law converting a recent decree law, there is this provision: in order to allow the timely achievement of digital transformation objectives for the interventions of the 5G Italy Plan for the creation of new suitable network infrastructures, practically nothing can be done anymore. We do not have Municipalities that today say: ""Instead of putting the pylon there, we put it there"", they have no power. This was a political clarity. I repeat, those who are against 5G, do so legitimately, I am surprised that those who today with a State law have favored a massive movement of these pylons, today in this chamber say the opposite. Then, for goodness sake, I repeat, I imagine that there is a local respect and I would not want it to be just a wink to those who are against 5G. Because there is no need for a specific study to be done, I am not the one saying this, I obviously have studied it in depth with the technicians of the Department, but above all with the ARPA, which is the one that must take the measurements, which must correspond to those limits that, as I said before, have increased. According to the ARPA it is useless, because it itself is part of an Italian ARPA system that continues to have a constant exchange of information regarding the scientific research that is done and as you know there is also a central body called ISPRA, also in connection with all the institutes that are doing the research and that largely deny some of the things that you said today, because to date the official results are those that regulate national legislation and we do not have, as autonomy, a possibility of changing technical standards that even have a European value. According to ARPA, it is more than enough to be part of this system, today it would be specific studies in Valle d'Aosta and money wasted, because all the institutes of which it is part, with very broad collaborations, our ARPA, are doing it with great effectiveness, therefore we will abstain."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,12,962,"Obviously we will maintain the vote. If in May the response that came from the Council had been of this nature, we would certainly have investigated further, but we did not have this response from the Council, or there was a step after the month of May, or... In any case, we are asking here, for the sake of people's health, if what is happening is a feasible path. You tell me that nothing more can be done, we take note of that, but in our opinion, an in-depth study with respect to the populations that have the Superphénix passing over their roofs... something will have to be seen and done because, in my opinion, there will be some problems. We will also carry out in-depth studies. I did not speak and I did not say that Forza Italia is against 5G, you cannot put that in my mouth, I simply said that for the sake of the health of the population it would be appropriate to carry out in-depth studies, and that is why we want to vote on this motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,6464,"Thank you, Councilor Caveri, for your answer that, for once, honestly, I expected to be different, precisely because I know that you are a person who prepares and who delves into the issues; instead you objectively fell into an answer that is more obvious than Mickey Mouse jokes, and I regret this for two reasons. The first is that you tried to try to paint the people who raise a request, which is not to return to the Stone Age, to live like the Mormons, but is a request - as was correctly said by colleagues from Forza Italia, as well as by other colleagues who preceded me during the illustration of this initiative, during the general discussion - to have protections and to do in-depth studies from the point of view of health. English: I am not known for being one of those who want to plant daisies on the highway, so I cannot be accused of being someone who hates modernity, I certainly hate impositions, you know that you and I think differently about mandatory vaccinations for example, I am for freedom, you are for forcing people, under penalty of social and work-related death, they are questions of choice: he was very happy that there were obligations for people who did or did not do a certain health treatment and this marks the difference between us which is absolutely legitimate, as you have highlighted. However, if you had had a less ideological and more substantive approach - because you are capable of doing this type of analysis, absolutely, certainly much more than the undersigned who has done less politics than you - and had limited yourself to reading the text, you would have seen that there is no conspiracy theory here, no flat-eartherism, no hypothesis of erasing any technological network in our region, but a very simple request, that is, to do studies and delve into the issue of the potential risks of the network. You raised the political issue and I am happy that you did, I will obviously answer you in two parts. The first is that if you go and look, despite the increase that you mentioned, which is absolutely correct, Italy remains one of the European countries with the lowest emissions, with the lowest limits, so evidently this increase was made, but keeping in mind that it was necessary to remain within certain standards, obviously receiving criticism, which you rightly recalled - and I think I don't have to explain to you, especially since you had a cohabitation in the Council with political movements, with ideas that you did not share - but sometimes, when you govern, you also have to find a compromise and sometimes you share things that perhaps you do not share, I am not saying that this has happened but I am speaking in general. I must tell you another thing, however, Councilor Caveri, that on the political issue you are forgetting a small passage, that is that this same commitment and this same study was decided by the Tuscany Region and not with a motion, but with a Council resolution. The last time I checked, and I check every morning, the Tuscany Region also had its own regional agency for control. The moment you tell us that the ARPA controls are sufficient, you tell us that the Tuscany Region is a Region of reckless madmen - who have a regional agency that doesn't work, flat-earthers, who probably even walk around with tinfoil over their heads so as not to be psychologically manipulated... - or we can accept the fact that perhaps, having a further study and further investigation, can only do good, because maybe it also supports what you say, maybe it confirms that there is no problem, that everything is fine, or maybe not. This reminds me a little of what happened this morning and what happened last week during the Commission: we asked to have a hearing with the business categories to get their opinion, but no, they said no, because they prefer to avoid the risk that someone might deny what you say or question it, and here I feel like I'm in exactly the same situation. They are afraid to do an in-depth study because maybe the results are not what they expected. Now you see, Councillor, we have approached the debate with the utmost openness, I think you can give me credit for that, I have not raised political issues, I have not raised issues, flat-earther crusades, I have simply raised a question which is what you see, there is raised somewhere an evident possibility that this could be harmful to health, because either we imagine that everything is always fine, or, if we want to put, as you have rightly done several times on several issues, science first, we can imagine that science often questions itself and has doubts - it is the essence of a demonstration - so having had this technology for a short time, even the long-term effects of this technology are not known. If what you say is actually true, then the recommendation of the European Council of 12 July 1999, which calls for promoting research programmes to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, would make no sense, taking into account the recommendation of international community research efforts, it will probably have been a flat-earth Europe that does not believe in progress and that wants to reduce us all to bring back the stone age or perhaps there are legitimate concerns. Perhaps, at this point, the Region, which is governed by the Democratic Party, will actually be a reckless Region, and then I advise you to perhaps communicate this to your colleagues, saying that your colleagues in Tuscany are all crazy and do not understand anything or perhaps perhaps raise doubts. Raising doubts, having doubts probably also leads to having results that can confirm or deny what we hypothesize, on one side and the other. I believe that this is a doubt that can come to everyone. You think you have the science infused and say: ""No, it is not like that"", we are sorry for you, but for us it is not like that. We obviously will not withdraw this motion, we are clearly anxious to see how the vote will be distributed, we have expressed our position and I think it is clear."

You are, in my opinion of course, and I agree with what I say, the disappointment of a people, because asking to delve into a topic like that of electromagnetic waves, on which all the communities... I mentioned last time the communities of the Ligurian Levant, where the Ligurian ANCI took action to ask for further information, and, among other things, the President of the Liguria Region had difficulties precisely on these aspects. We ask you to at least discuss it in the Commission, which among other things are classified, so the data cannot even be released, not even that... I mentioned Article 191 of the European Treaty, so dear to Councilor Caveri, which puts the protection of health before economic interests; we all know this, there are large, enormous economic interests, well, let's try to protect them, some are more convinced than others, perhaps no one is against progress. Then if I participate in demonstrations with the No Vax I do so willingly, I don't go to see who you hang out with, and in any case I don't care at all. The point is that I support the freedom of every citizen of the Aosta Valley to express themselves and I also go to listen to them, look at that. The fact that recent studies, certified, etc. continue to be cited... I continue to reiterate that the Institute of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Protection from Non-Ionizing Radiation that I told you about before, is a private agency, with limited activity, made up of a non-institutional Commission of twelve members, Bavarian, in which, moreover, no doctor was present - and I address my colleague Councilor Barmasse, who told me that there is no doctor in this hearing. There is not a doctor here in this Commission either, look at that, and yet ARPA, like all other political governments, relies on this study. You may not know, I'll tell you this too: in 2020 the Court of Appeal of Turin denounced the conflict of interest of the Bavarian ICNIRP that I told you about before, defining it as ""a private organization, whose guidelines have great economic and strategic importance for the telecommunications industry"", with which several members of the ICNIRP have ties through consultancy relationships. The Court of Appeal of Turin also says, ruling from 2020: ""It is evident that these subjects should refrain from evaluating the effect on health, which ICNIRP itself has declared safe and not harmful to health"". These are rulings of Italian courts. You smile, as usual continue in this spirit. You are a real disappointment."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,18,3819,"To declare my vote and to confirm what I said previously, that is, that we will support this motion, but also to make a consideration more than anything else on the response given by Councilor Caveri, that is, the very heart of the motion, that is, the need or not to do a specific study. The Councilor says: ""There is no need to do a specific study, I'm not saying it, ARPA says it, it is completely useless because ARPA is within a national system of which ISPRA is also a part and therefore there are already studies that speak, that document a series of things"". I think we all know that ARPA is within the SNPA system, that is, the federal system that includes twenty-one environmental agencies, because there are the two autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, and which rightly also includes ISPRA, but what does this system do? It is a system that collects the studies that the individual agencies do, and then obviously also elaborates some guidelines, gives indications to the other agencies, but I don't really understand why our ARPA couldn't, in our territory, do a small study with the characteristics that we have highlighted and then obviously share it, within the system, reason with the others, because normally this is what they do, with the supervision of ISPRA, with the relationships that exist between the various agencies. The motivation leaves me a little perplexed, that we can't change things is fine, it can absolutely be accepted, but contributing to a scientific study on a territory that is limited (which perhaps could also lend itself to making assessments to share and perhaps to validate or not validate through the other agencies that can do the same action in their own territory) seems to me to be a fairly sensible thing. Honestly, it is something that has left me a little perplexed as a motivation. I would also like to make a clarification, but I think that the Councilor, when he spoke, was not referring to us so much, then it seems to me that he also made it quite explicit regarding the issue that there are people who are against 5G. I specified, intervening, that from our point of view this is a technology that should not be demonized, that both fiber and 5G can be useful to fill the gap that exists, that is, the fact that our country is still poorly digitalized, but this should not be done at the expense of what could be the protection of citizens' health. I do not pretend to say that it is absolutely negative, I reported opinions that are the opinions of scientists, and I believe that they also have a very respectable curriculum, but then, precisely to arrive at a definition and a closing of the circle, all the studies that can be done, in my opinion, are useful and can also be used for a broader debate that obviously does not only involve our region. It is obvious that we are within a very complex country system, but I certainly agree with what the Councilor said about the fact that, at the level of government decisions, moving the limits from 6 Volts/meter to 15 is a decision that was taken at a central level, so it is obvious that choices were made on this. Then everyone can have concerns, which are absolutely legitimate, and want to go into more detail, I think it has been explained, this does not take away the fact that our country was in a better situation compared to other European countries - certainly from my point of view - because those 6 Volts per meter were, from the point of view of health protection, better than 15, but this was not the case, it was decided differently and there are obviously responsibilities on this."

We asked for the data of the sponsorships of the contributions between 2021 and 2023, the considerable amount is close to a million euros, but above all some surprising things emerge, such as the payments to Confindustria Valle d'Aosta for a conference (it is a bit strange that Confindustria was not able to do it alone ...), there are a total of 180 thousand euros in favor of the Municipality of Courmayeur and the Courmayeur Foundation, while for many other Municipalities the figure is zero. There are contributions to subjects totally external to the Valle d'Aosta, to pro loco in the province of Avellino and Viterbo and then we know that there are denials and rejected requests. We therefore want to better understand how it is operating and we want to understand what sense there is in the recent dinner invitation for three journalists from each newspaper operating in the Valley. An opportunity to get to know each other and to explain, it is essentially said in the invitation, but, if CVA wants to explain its position, it should call a press conference and not a dinner. It is an initiative, in our opinion, a bit clumsy, which, among other things, embarrasses many people. CVA is at the center of an important discussion on its role and operations and the proof comes from the surprising speed with which the IV Commission was called for next Thursday, with the hearing of the CVA leaders, we do not know exactly why, given the vagueness of the agenda and above all the many arrears of the Commission. The CVA issue is a delicate matter, it is a company on which the media must be able to speak in total freedom and without conditioning and that dinner invitation structured in this way seems to us an inappropriate form of pressure.

On the company's website there is a specific section which indicates the methods of presentation and disbursement of sponsorships and donations and above all the evaluation criteria which concern two macro items: the territorial value of the proposal and the social and impact value. As regards the second part of the question, the criteria on the basis of which CVA proceeds to dinner invitations, CVA highlights that dinners are part of a typical external relations activity of a large industrial group which is substantiated in discussions with stakeholders, among which certainly include representatives of the world of communication in the reference territory."

The disputed part is that, we could say in summary, relating to the possibilities that the Regions and autonomous Provinces would have in identifying, precisely, the suitable areas, this to dissuade regional legislators from adopting, pending the judgment, laws that restrict the number of suitable areas. Let us remember, if I have updated data, but Table A of the decree should not be changed, therefore it identifies the objectives of additional power, in 2030 it should even reach 328 megawatts in Valle d'Aosta, in particular within the decree there was a time frame for the application by regional law by the Regions. As far as the Regions with special statutes and autonomous provinces were concerned, there was the safeguard clause. We ask the competent Assessor what is the current status of application and achievement of the objectives set by the decree Suitable Areas in Valle d'Aosta."

The decree in question, the one that gave six months to adopt with a regional law the suitable and unsuitable areas, saw on our part the institution through resolution 1193 of the technical table and the control room that must lead to a bill to be approved by the Council by the end of the year, also with the approval of the Council, times that obviously all the Regions found excessively short, but in any case we all got to work and before this ruling we were ready to accept a first draft of the law, which, with respect to the calendar given by the resolution, had to arrive at the proposal of the Council by November 22. English: The ruling of the Council of State changes the conditions for developing the legislation and above all creates an impediment that is currently suspended until February 5, when there will be an expression of merit and obviously creates a situation that does not put us in a position to complete the work as Regions. There are two aspects that the Regions have brought to the attention of the Government: a request for a 90-day extension of the deadline set by the decree expiring on December 30, 2024. An amendment has been presented that we hope will be accepted, precisely to give time to complete this verification and in recent days, both the Technical Commission and the Conference of the Regions have asked the Ministry to be able to have a technical assessment of the impediments that the Council of State has given with respect to article 20, paragraph 8, of Legislative Decree 199/2021. This is for the more bureaucratic administrative part and also of a legal nature. I undertake - there will be a meeting of the technical tables at the beginning of the week - to give you, also for information, what will emerge from this work at the technical table. Compared to the objectives, at the moment about 20 megawatts have been installed, over the year about another 3.4 megawatts, however, what is missing from the GSE - and I finish, I conclude, I apologize for having been long - the valorization of hydroelectric production that we know can be differentiated from that of photovoltaic."

Obviously all this put the person in a deep state of humiliation and prostration and rightly the family, which is an attentive and present family, reported and highlighted a deep discomfort for this action. We have reported several problems in this facility and highlighted the fact that this is absolutely not the treatment to be provided to a vulnerable person and we ask if any actions have been taken to ascertain what happened in the facility and, in particular, what measures have been adopted to avoid the occurrence of the actions described."

The event refers to the actions implemented by the facility staff following the need to proceed with a specific care requirement of a guest. After washing the head, scales and scabs were present that prevented the effective application of the moisturizing oil. A nurse therefore thought it was best to cut the hair to facilitate the application of the moisturizing oil on the skin. The day after the family members requested clarification, they were called to a meeting and given the necessary explanations. The family stated that they understood and accepted the clarifications. The episode is therefore configured as a legitimate action within the scope of an assessment of the state of health not affected by environmental conditions or recreational presuppositions, as feared by the request. Instead, we find it unusual again to use the council instruments to reach such a level of inspection detail, because this inspection level could almost make one think that this management level is up to you and/or her, but no one can be so naive.

It seems that there were several meetings, always within the facility, to try to understand what happened.

With respect to this question, there is currently no new developments regarding the extension of the agreement for the reduction of the motorway toll to category B vehicles. As we have already had the opportunity to share last February, this is a technical issue related to the height of the front axle of the vehicle, on which the concessionaires obviously cannot intervene, but above all it is an issue related to the setting of the concessions in question, which is however still linked to the identification of a fixed route and which in any case is subject to authorization from the Ministry of Transport currently valid for the period 2024-2026. The topic is not closed, in the sense that our intention is to review, in a comprehensive and improving perspective, the existing facilitation procedure in order to simplify it and to further implement the use of the motorway section compared to ordinary roads, with more flexible tariff concessions. This is one of the aspects also included in the regional transport plan, on which we will continue the discussion with the motorway concessionaires.

With respect to this interpellation, this is one of those cases in which the intentions, in the specific case those set out in the aforementioned motion of July 2021, then encounter obstacles in reality that are different from those imagined. Already in November 2022, following a similar question, an account was given of the difficulties that had emerged in following up on the commitment of the motion, first of all because, even if these are entities of the single sector, an agreement between the entities is still necessary to proceed with what is in any case a transfer of an individual contract, as provided for in Article 43, paragraph 4bis, of Regional Law 22/2010. A series of critical issues have emerged and have not yet been resolved which, at the moment, also considering that the Personnel Department has been absorbed by the planning and implementation of the competitions for the renewal of the 2022-2024 regional collective agreement for non-managerial staff of the single sector, have prevented the activation of the working table with the trade unions even though the Department itself has started working on a proposal in this direction. The issues to be resolved are: first of all, with reference to the economic treatment, the professional profile of OSS is classified in position B2S, while the other professional profiles of category B employed by the Regional Administration of the other entities of the sector are classified in economic position B2. For such OSS personnel, a reclassification in a lower economic position would therefore be determined, in light of which it is necessary to define whether the employee maintains the economic treatment of origin and in what way, or must accept the new economic treatment of the new classification position. The economic re-classification must be provided for by law, the contract not being sufficient. Secondly, mobility with a change of professional profile from social-health operator to assistant cannot be ordered ex officio in the face of a supervening total or partial unsuitability for the duties of OSS. In fact, these are very different professional profiles, for whose conversion an aptitude test for the role of the job would be necessary. Again: it must be taken into account that with the acceleration of the digitalization of the Public Administration, the professional and administrative profiles of the B2 position category, specialized operator, have necessarily evolved and today require much higher technical skills than ten years ago, so much so that the reform of the professional organization of Public Administrations, already introduced at state level and soon to be introduced at regional level, requires, as a requirement for access to category B, a diploma and no longer a middle school diploma. This is why the competition for the recruitment of personnel in the B-B2 positions category, with the professional profile of assistant, has been postponed to 2026, to avoid holding a competition today requiring, under current legislation, a qualification that is no longer adequate for the tasks and professional content that category B employees will be called upon to perform. In light of the above, it is therefore not easy to define today the rules for the mobility of personnel with a professional profile of OSS towards administrative profiles of the roles of the bodies of the single regional sector before having proceeded to define a new professional system and a new system of classification of personnel, also because hypothesizing mobility towards other professional profiles of the same category is not feasible given the limitations of the working capacities of the workers in question."

What we highlight, however, is that over time there have been people in the OSS category who have been moved, for example, from structures, such as the J.B. Festaz Company, we talked about it right in the last Council, to the Hospital, perhaps even doing less heavy work, because we cannot say that every department has the same workload, because it is quite obvious that those who are in orthopedics will lift weights, those who are in an outpatient clinic will most likely do another type of work. What is required is whether they cannot be placed in the reception, in the switchboards, as always happened and as has happened over time on many occasions; if this is no longer possible, perhaps give the possibility of being able to move to structures that are less demanding from a certain point of view, even with respect to their workloads. What leaves me even more perplexed is the fact that it is enough to see the many resignations that have occurred and are occurring over time to understand that this professional figure, indispensable for the maintenance of any health structure, is somehow always given little consideration: therefore, battles are not fought to define the exhausting work of these figures, this is why they are not given the possibility of being relocated to perhaps less demanding jobs, when on other occasions we provide the staff as if nothing had happened and then a strike comes upon us or we receive resignations one after another. I would therefore ask, from this point of view, if it is not feasible to move within the administrative structures, as the President told us, for all the obstacles that exist, to give these people the possibility of being able to access perhaps sectors and departments that are less demanding than those they have to serve."

With this letter to the President of CVA, he intended to reiterate, with reference to the question of the PCP council group discussed in this chamber on May 22, the positions of the company with respect to the procedures for appointing the administrative and control bodies of the group company and the discipline of the related compensation. On these points, the President of CVA has punctually illustrated the legal motivations of the decisions taken, the strategic and operational assumptions that underlie these decisions, and the parameters used. Finally, the President of CVA highlighted the fact that the terminology used by the Councilor risks constituting reputational damage for CVA and damage to the operations of CVA EOS, as well as damage to the honorability and professionalism of the governing and control bodies of the company in question, representing the willingness, in compliance with the autonomy and reciprocal roles, to provide all the clarifications requested. The note therefore constituted in fact an explanation regarding the facts that had been questioned and contested by Councilor Minelli, as mentioned, during a previous council meeting and not a request to be answered.

I asked you out of fair consideration for your role as the final beneficial owner of the system of regional subsidiaries. The second point is instead a clarification by the undersigned, always on the motivation of the question, because, you see, I am not interested in the emoluments, which for me should always take into account the intercurrent relationships of risk and management complexity of the activities to be performed or the procedures for selecting administrators or the thicket of internal rules and regulations, on which I still reserve the right to study, but rather in the fact that certain situations, certain requests or answers, a certain nervousness at times in responding, I am not only talking about the political counterpart, often end up implying something else and this worries me much more because often the mystery or the unclear or the classified can generate reputational consequences much more important than a question or an interpellation.

The practices relating to the minors have not yet been completed. Contents and regulations are being defined. If approved by the competent bodies, it will be the University's responsibility to provide all the necessary details. Question no. 2 obviously falls short because it asks me, if so, what are the specifications of the mini diploma in gender policies and what are the practical applications of the aforementioned course."
47999,XVI,21/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,3809,"Probably, if I had been in his position, to the second question, even without knowing exactly which direction it would have gone, I would have answered: what are the practical applications? ""None"", I would have answered like that, but I am me. I am obviously happy that there is still no information and I hope that this is just a ""Voice escaped from the Senate"". Allow me to provide a bit of context so at least we know what we are talking about, yesterday we talked about science, but, if there is a theory that frontally opposes science, it is the theory or, better, the ideology of gender, or gender, if you will. Years ago, this was quite evident to the point that some of its proponents tried with denialism to hide its existence, but then, by dint of talking about gender violence, gender discrimination, with fig leaves to mask the rainbow gender propaganda, the absurd theory came back through the window before it had even fully gone out the door. Now under what was somewhat defined during the interview the lofty name of gender studies ... this obviously unfortunately also peeps out in what should be the temple of knowledge, that is the University, and all the ambiguity of the courses that are established under this umbrella is in the absolutely non-univocal sense that the magical term gender, that is gender, which can mean different things, even opposites, but in any case is not attributable to the obvious scientific and anatomical sense of biological sex and this is a bit of the ambivalence on which it plays. This rather ideological and oriented perspective would be aimed at promoting at a cultural level an inclusive and non-discriminatory narrative and representation of gender identities, beautiful, even if in reality this does not mean anything. In the United States, from which unfortunately we take inspiration - now we hope that with the advent of Trump a certain quality of type of studies will no longer see the light -, there are many courses that refer to these theories, gender sensitive journalism, the social analysis of gender equality, gender language and language, gender perspective literatures, literatures and migrations and inequalities, gender statistics, gender economies, culture, politics and gender empowerment, the world, in short, reread in the light of the most famous and constructive gender theory on sexuality. Should this represent a cultural education or, more easily, and this is objectively a danger, a flattening, a formatting on mainstream thought? We believe that it is this second option. The doubt arises because gender, instead of the archaic scientific sex, is spoken of almost everywhere, and in the name of gender they want to unite the male and female bathrooms, they want to authorize the student to change his name based on intimate sensations or allow the male athlete, who declares he feels like a woman, to compete with biological ladies and young ladies. Every reference to events that occurred during the Olympics is purely intentional. If there are only two sexes, according to these theories, unfortunately we know this well, the genders would be dozens, perhaps hundreds and this based on purely subjective, arbitrary and undefined criteria, but then how can we do science without fixed points that delimit the field of science? How can we establish whether Mario Rossi is queer, gender free, asexual or simply non-binary? For some time now, the spread of gender theory has been supplanting biology and related sciences, as, among others, the atheist mathematician Piergiorgio Odifreddi or the feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero have also recognized. Let us hope that the University will soon return to its former splendor, that is, more Galilean science, less gender subculture."

Childcare centers: to date, four childcare centers are active in three educational institutions: Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Mont-Emilius 3 Charvensod, Childcare Center of Jovençan, Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin, Gignod, Childcare Center of Roisan and Doues, Elio Reinotti, Pont-Saint-Martin, Childcare Center of Lillianes. As regards the multi-year national plan projects, this is DGR 134 of 12 February 2024. As foreseen by the aforementioned resolution of the Council, the projects that can be financed with state resources in the 2024-2025 financial year can be traced back to the following priorities: priority 1) projects for 0-6 year old childhood centers and educational continuity; priority 2) projects for 0-6 year old educational continuity, 9 projects financed for a total of €563,703.10 in the two-year period; priority 3) projects for the enhancement of kindergarten, 9 projects financed for a total of €204,217.44 in the two-year period; priority 4) building interventions on nurseries and kindergartens, 5 projects financed for a total of €157,645.38 in 2024; priority 5) purchases of furniture for nursery schools and kindergartens, 4 projects funded for a total of €143,627.63 in the two-year period. In question no. 2, it is necessary to specify that the children belonging to the age groups indicated should not be divided by school complex, since they are managed by early childhood services. It is assumed that reference is being made to the early childhood centers. The requested data are therefore the following: early childhood center of Jovençan, educational institution Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Mont-Emilius 3 of Charvensod number of children eight, 0-1 two children, 1-2 two children, 2-3 four children; early childhood center of Roisan, educational institution Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin-Gignod number of children seven, 0-1 none, 1-2 six children, 2-3 one child; Doues childcare centre, Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin-Gignod school institution number of children four, 0-1 two children, 1-2 one child, 2-3 one child; Lillianes childcare centre, Elio Reinotti school institution of Pont-Saint-Martin number of children 11, 0-1 one child, 1-2 eight children, 2-3 two children. Question no. 3: childcare centres. Childcare centres represent a significant way of implementing the integrated 0-6 education and instruction system. As indicated both at a regulatory level and at the level of accompaniment and support in schools for services through the 0.6 table and the reference bodies, in particular the Superintendency of Studies and the Department of Social Policies, the projects are being implemented respecting the sphere of professional competences of both segments and for the school part in compliance with the approval and formalization procedures within the competent collegiate bodies. Only two months from the start of the school year is too tight a timeframe to be able to make assessments supported by experience. The task of the 0-6 table will also be to collect elements to make appropriate assessments at an interinstitutional level. With regard to the multi-year national plan project DGR 134 of 12 February 2024, the projects are in the start-up phase; it will be the task of the 0-6 table to monitor and evaluate their significance and effectiveness."

We are referring to the construction site of the Arch of Augustus. During the last inspection, the topic of the guided visits provided for by the contract was addressed in order to define the calendar and the methods for carrying out this activity while respecting the safety of the route. The visits that will soon be scheduled have the purpose of making known the design path and the works in progress aimed at preserving the monument, for which they require a technical preparation time also in relation to the interferences with the works in progress. As regards question two, for the printing of the three-dimensional model, the 3D model and the point cloud useful for its construction were provided to the companies. The company is in the process of identifying the supplier for the construction. As regards question no. 3, the construction site sign indicates the figures required by law, but the work group that carried out the technical-administrative practice in the design phase and today in the execution phase is also composed of other professionals. In fact, in the design phase, for which the research, surveys, analyses carried out over the years by the Scientific Analysis structure were used, a special work group was created composed of the architect Cristina De La Pierre, superintendent now retired, also with the role of RUP in the design phase, Dr. Alessandra Armirotti, archaeologist of the Superintendency, architect Nathalie Dufour, Superintendency, the surveyor Salvatore Martino of the Superintendency, collaborator of the RUP, UNI BS for the creation of the BIM model, the colleagues of the Scientific Analysis Office of the Superintendency, the engineer Daniele Monaja for safety, and the company Koinè for the skills in restoration. In the execution phase, the Works Management Office is composed of Dr. Alessandra Armirotti, archaeologist of the Superintendence, scientific manager, architect Nathalie Dufour, Superintendence director of works and RUP, surveyor Salvatore Martino, Superintendence, collaborator of the RUP Koiné restoration company as operational director of the restoration, engineer Daniele Monaya, coordinator of safety in the execution phase.

We will arrive in 2025, I imagine, and we will see what we can achieve. On aspect 3, however, I tried to document myself a bit more, as you will have seen, I did, I asked for access to the documents also because there was something that was out of place, in the sense that the company Koinè of Rome was commissioned to carry out the preparatory investigation and intervention activities and these activities will become an integral part of the intervention project. Then this project was entrusted with a detailed list of operations, always prepared by Koinè, surveys, mappings, even the technical specifications and the metric calculation. The question is simple: if we have all these skills and you rightly in response to the question of the Hospital, when I asked you why the medieval church was destroyed, you rightly exalted, as is right, the skills of our technicians and of the Superintendency I wonder why all these studies and research must be entrusted to Koinè, which I imagine does not know much about Roman monuments, in fact, from what I asked, I had answers from the staff who are now retired and the facade of the Roman Theater and the Porta Pretoria were entirely followed by the structures of the regional Superintendency and it is not clear why the Arch of Augustus instead must be entrusted to a company in Rome, when we have all the skills here, all the knowledge on the type of pudding, on the mortars, I had them explain to me about particular mortars, even the sands, etc.; material that here in Aosta is known and known well. It also seems to me that there is little bibliography and at an operational level there is not all this expertise to operate on a monument that is unique in the world. They also explained to me that there is a laboratory restoration office for the management of archaeological materials that should have followed the entire technical project; I don't know if it was involved, however, as I told you, I made an access to the documents, we will go even deeper because if we have the skills here, we have the capabilities here, I honestly can't explain why we have to spend public money and assign skills that are not local, when perhaps ours are better prepared."
48002,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Asili nido",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,2,5813,"How many children in the age groups 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 participate in the project at the Roisan center and how many at the Doues center. With reference to the question, I report the following data: Roisan nursery center seven children, 0-1 none, 1-2 six children, 2-3 one child; Doues nursery center four children, 0-1 two children, 1-2 one child, 2-3 one child. Second question: ""what activity has been carried out to date and what are your initial assessments"". At the Grand-Combin school in Gignod on September 3, 2024, on the occasion of the first teachers' meeting of the nursery school for the 2024-2025 school year, a working group was established which includes the teachers of the nursery schools of the institution called the ""extended group 0-6"". The college established that the working hours of this group will be ten throughout the 2024-2025 school year and that this commitment will be included in the hours provided for by letter a) and letter b) of paragraph 3 of article 44 of the 2019-2021 national employment contract. A restricted group called the ""restricted 0-6 group"" was also formed, which includes only the teachers from the Doues and Roisan campuses directly involved in the hub to deal with specific needs. Two teachers were appointed as referents for the extended 0-6 group, with the task of updating themselves on regional and national legislation and on the 0-6 integrated system, recording the meetings of the extended 0-6 group, collecting observations and requests from colleagues, updating the part of the PTOF relating to continuity with nurseries and the 0-6 integrated system, in collaboration with the school principal, informing the school principal of the critical issues in the application of the 0-6 integrated system. Also during the meeting on September 3, the teachers of the nursery schools of the Grand-Combin institution asked the headmistress to have a meeting with the president of the cooperative La Libellula to get more information on the project ""Grand-Combin nursery school"". The principal accepted the proposal and promptly contacted the President to organize the meeting scheduled for October 16, 2024. The extended group 0-6 has already met in person at the Variney secondary school on October 2, 2024, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., on October 16, 2024 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., on October 30, 2024 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on November 6, 2024. The nursery schools of Etroubles, Gignod, Signayes, Oyace, Valpelline will organize, starting in January 2025, two meetings in which the children of the nursery school will go to the Variney nursery school for a day on the snow and for animated reading. Subsequently, the two-and-a-half year old children from the nursery school will visit the kindergarten for a day of creative or musical activities. In addition to these days that are common to all the kindergartens of the entire institution, in this experimental period in the municipalities of Doues and Roisan, the children from the kindergarten and nursery school, given their proximity, will be able to share some of these activities: experience moments of meeting to get to know each other and socialize, take part in some common activities to share the routine, share moments related to the various holidays and events, participate in trips to the local library or for a walk. The activities listed above will be carried out taking into account the educational-didactic program, which has already been established by the kindergarten teachers at the beginning of the school year, considering the interventions of the experts, the educational trips and the projects of continuity between kindergarten and primary school that have already been approved by the teachers' council. The teachers emphasize the importance of maintaining the identity of the nursery school while respecting the mutual specificities (nursery/infancy) recalling that there has already been a nursery-infancy continuity for many years between the children of the last year of nursery school, two and a half years old, and the children of the three-year-old nursery school. This bridge project has always been functional. The hours of programming and the number of meetings are not quantified in order to allow a free educational choice for the schools of Doues and Roisan. Since it is an experimental project, ongoing verification will also be planned in order to collect observations and monitor the meetings from time to time in order to be able to conclude the project with a qualitative analysis. The next meetings of the extended group 0-6 are scheduled for March 12 from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm and for March 26 from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm. The latter will be held in the presence of Dr. Christina Arfuso, technical director at the Superintendence of Studies, who, with a circular sent to the schools, made herself available to hold information meetings at the request of the schools. The agenda of the two meetings will be defined together with the teachers. The inauguration of the Doues nursery was held on Friday, October 18, in which the children of the nursery and primary school of the complex participated together with their teachers; we are waiting for the inauguration date of the Roisan nursery, in which the children of the nursery and primary school of the complex will be invited to participate together with their teachers. The first evaluations highlight a collaboration started in a systematic and shared manner. From what can be seen from the pedagogical-didactic point of view, it is necessary to wait a few more months."

48003,XVI,21/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,2,6782,"I am responding to Councilor Lucianaz's requests on 5G antennas, which we have already partly discussed yesterday afternoon. I must say that Law 16/2024, which we recently revised within the scope of Regional Law 25/2005, has as its purpose the unitary management of public stations in the Region. You will remember that the vast majority of the infrastructures were owned by the Unités des Communes or Municipalities and have passed or, rather, are passing through the Region. From this point of view, in accordance with national regulations, a rationalization and optimization of the planning and construction of sites equipped for radio telecommunications of publicly owned stations are envisaged. The changes made, which have been approved by this Council, are intended to adapt the law to the organizational management context, allowing, as I was saying, to formalize the transfer of ownership of radio telecommunications infrastructures of local authorities. On the one hand there is a question of rationalization, as I was saying, and, on the other, there is also the fact that in the dialogue that must be had on these types of infrastructures, an administrative structure such as that of the Region certainly has greater strength and also greater authority. The problem of information that has been raised remains, we have inserted paragraph 5bis in the revision of law 25, which says: ""In order to optimize the planning and construction of publicly owned stations on the regional territory, the regional structure competent in telecommunications matters can request information from telecommunications operators or telecommunications infrastructure operators regarding the planning for the construction of new radioelectric station stations on the territory of the Region"". This is something new, because in fact the big players, in the case of the Aosta Valley there are essentially two, who build those infrastructures, that is, those pylons on which various operators are then positioned; today, they did not have any type of dialogue with the Region by law, which therefore had difficulty understanding especially future planning. Now, based on the law that I was talking about that has just been modified, we have sent letters to the various interlocutors to gain greater clarity on the expanding situation. In the meantime, we were talking about the cartography that shows the different types of antennas installed on the territory. These technical data are the responsibility of the individual operators who must compulsorily communicate them to the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM), which is an independent authority that was established in 1997. Among the various competences of AGCOM is the construction and maintenance of the database of Internet access networks existing on the national territory, this is based on article 22 of the Communications Code that dates back to 2024. The database offers the possibility of analyzing the state of development of the Internet access offer at the individual address and of making comparative assessments on the different technologies and speeds. The information and content requested are the exclusive responsibility of the telecommunications operators themselves, who autonomously and independently manage the policies and technical specifications that concern their own radiocommunication networks. Below is the link, I will give it to the Councilor, to the AGCOM portal for publishing the database of access networks, so, as an example, you will find all the data you requested, but as an example I will give you an extraction of a coverage map of the territory of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta with 5G technology in the 3.4 GHz-3.8 GHz band and you will see from this colored map where the different stations are and, by entering the AGCOM website, you will see the specifics area by area. The competent regional structure - I have already said in part the following - has long since started contacts with the radio and telecommunications infrastructure operators to know these development plans in execution of this article 5bis of the new rewriting of law 25 and we have formally asked to be able to know the information relating to the programming and construction of the new radio stations on the regional territory, this information has not yet arrived. English: I must say that the attitude of these companies that manage these stations is an attitude very far from respecting local autonomy, I already said it yesterday, this comes from the fact that the current legislation is a legislation very favorable to the extension of 5G not only in the terms that we discussed yesterday more than doubling the amount of radio frequencies allowed today by law, but also from that recent reform of the law by the Italian Parliament, which, in fact, bypasses the municipal authorities, who were the ones who could propose some type of exception with respect to the technical choice of installation in a certain area; this is unfortunately a sad observation compared evidently to a firepower of these telecommunications companies in the name obviously in this case in particular of the fact that the plan regarding the extension of 5G is strictly linked to the need to spend the funds of the PNRR and therefore the government's choice was to speed up as much as possible to avoid any type of interference, even positive of course, by local authorities. Local authorities, I answer the last question, are directly involved in the authorization process provided for by the current law, it goes through the procedures referred to in the one-stop shop. The regional structures will in any case take charge of communicating to local authorities the programming information that will come from the feedback from radiotelecommunication operators or operators involved in the construction of the new stations. I must say frankly that, when we inserted this provision of information from the pylon managers into the reform of law 25, we had doubts that the Government could in some way object to the legitimacy of this law, brandishing, as has sometimes happened in the past, the principle of a division of powers, therefore of a hypothetical unconstitutionality of a request by us to affect structures of this kind. Fortunately, the law has not been challenged and therefore we will do everything possible to be able to have great clarity on future projects for the construction of 5G networks."
48003,XVI,21/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,2892,"Councilor, today I have to thank you for the tone and the completeness of your answer and perhaps, after having clashed, I have to sincerely thank you, also because your answer is complete and satisfactory. There are some critical issues, they are not hidden: one is our poor autonomy... because here it is already a success, from what you said, that with article 5bis the Region can request information from these monsters of communication, therefore, if we are reduced to this, clearly we are not on the side of sovereignty over our territory for sure. As for AGCOM, you rightly told me that it is an independent body, but it must report to Parliament, that is, there is still a Parliament that must verify what it is doing on the territory. I remind you that only recently - yesterday we talked about the Tuscany Region which about two months ago adopted this decision to deepen the research - the AGCOM commissioner Giacomelli wrote at a certain point to the President of Tuscany: ""What is certain is that I will never resign myself to the idea that Tuscany becomes the promised land of flat-earthers, No Vax conspiracy theorists of various kinds"". This is the air that blows in AGCOM, however, apart from this, I had asked for these insights because the whole 5G story started badly and is not working any better. I remind you that on May 5, 2019, AGCOM approved the use of frequencies for 5G without authorization from any Ethics Committee, without informed consent, without prior risk assessment, or environmental and health monitoring. Three days later, May 8, 2019, AGCOM deliberated to begin testing the three 5G bands for two years in 120 Italian municipalities without the knowledge of the citizens but without the knowledge of the Mayors themselves and it continues like this. The latest provision is worrying in my opinion, then I have no other information, the provision of the law you cited, the one of December 31, 2023, as far as I know, was not subjected to any evaluation by the Unified Conference of Local Authorities and there were quite a few Mayors who were worried about this extension. The whole 5G issue, beyond the fact that one can be in favor or not of a pushed technology, is worrying about the ways in which it is implemented. As for the aspect of installing 5G antennas, it is a concern of many people, yesterday I told you in the classroom that only yesterday in Milan they decided to place a thousand antennas on a thousand street lamps in the city precisely because there is this need to have an antenna at least every 100-150 meters, I do not know in Valle d'Aosta what choices will be made, but yesterday's request, in order not to always return to the same topic, was precisely to ask for more information and more comparison. Let's hope that the register will change a bit soon. Thanks anyway."
48004,XVI,21/11/2024,AGRICOLTURA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992.0,M,PA,2,3773,"In responding to your initiative, I would like to briefly recall the procedure that regulates the disbursement of advance payments provided for by the CAP. With regard to the 2024 campaign, I would like to remind you that reference is being made to two separate programming periods: that of the PSR 2014-2022 and that of the CSR 2023-2027 and that for both, starting from 16 October this year, Member States can pay advances of up to 75% for direct payments and up to 85% for rural development interventions based on surface area and animals. It should also be noted that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry has delegated to AGEA the activation of the necessary procedures useful for allowing the payment of advances by the paying agencies. With regard to direct payments, AGEA Coordinamento, with its own circular, has defined the premiums affected by this advance, as well as the maximum percentage of advance that can be paid and the unit amount of the same. The interventions that most concern farmers in the Aosta Valley are the basic payment, redistributive support, payment for young farmers and eco-scheme 1. With regard to rural development interventions, on 4 October 2024 a plenary meeting of AGEA Regions was held to plan the activities necessary for the payment of applications for the 2024 campaign. Coming to the first question, the competent offices tell me that, with regard to direct payments, AGEA has made 1,178 payments, for a total of 2,222,430.25 euros, while, with regard to rural development interventions, no company has yet obtained advance payments. Remaining within the scope of rural development 2023-2027, the Aosta Valley Region has requested AGEA to disburse advances for SRA 30, Animal Welfare, and SRB 01, Compensatory Allowances, rapid annual payments, which play a priority role. At the request of the Region, AGEA has therefore prepared the creation of the automated payment list of the advance relating to the SRA 30 intervention, which concerns 598 beneficiaries and a disbursable amount of €1,166,171.37. Regarding the second and third questions, I would like to point out that the advances are normally paid by AGEA by 30 November each year. For example, the advances for the 2023 campaign of the SRA 30 intervention were issued on 28 November 2023. With regard to the agri-environmental measures of the PSR 2014-2022, measure 10, and the annual payments for animal welfare, the SRA 30 and the compensatory allowance for mountain areas, the SRB 01 of the CSR, we currently do not see any technical problems that would prevent the advances from being paid by 30 November. I can therefore state that, given the usual timing of the advance payments, we cannot speak today of a real delay in the liquidation of these measures. As regards the SRA 08 interventions, the agri-environment, the SRA 29, organic farming, of the CSR 2023-2027, activated for the first time in Valle d'Aosta this year in the 2024 campaign, they were the subject of the last technical meeting between AGEA and the Regions, which took place on Friday 15 November, during which it emerged that the implementation of the new algorithms could require a longer timeframe than an ordinary year. The definitive regional provision by AREA VDA of the data necessary for the disbursement of these advances took place on the following Monday, that of 18 November 2024. AGEA reassured the Regions that the SRA 29 intervention, therefore organic farming, of particular interest to our Region, will be given priority for development."
48004,XVI,21/11/2024,AGRICOLTURA,en,Planaz,Dino,1972.0,M,RV,4,1652,"Thank you Councilor for your reply. I would like to point out that the title of the initiative is not my own free will, it came out of the offices, but it is understandable. We know very well that the advance payment from European directives cannot be paid before October 16, it goes until November 30 and then we need to see if the practices of the companies coincide with the commitments requested, but following your entire list of aid - and I thank you for the clarity of your answer - I have a doubt, but we will evaluate later with other documents, but you said that the Aosta Valley farmers are entitled to eco-scheme 1 and you did not tell me about eco-scheme 2. Eco-scheme 2, just to clarify, is the eco-scheme that is most representative in our Region, it is the eco-scheme linked to the grazing of animals, an eco-scheme of significant importance both from an economic point of view but also from the point of view of animal welfare that I do not see mentioned in your answer, if then perhaps you can send it to me in a different way or we will proceed with another type of initiative. We are pleased that the aid continues, taking into account the new programming that began for a number of measures last year, but it takes time to get into full swing. We hope that the advances will be paid in the expected time and that they can provide some support to companies in a period like this at the end of the season where the (incomprehensible) has ended where a whole series of economic commitments by the same are followed and to be able to also deal with the organization of everything that concerns the winter season and the following ones."
48005,XVI,21/11/2024,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992.0,M,PA,2,2764,"On 29 October 2024, the Legambiente Valle d'Aosta Association sent a note to the Councillor for Agriculture and Natural Resources and, for information, to the media, in which it reported excessive hunting related to the culling of foxes in the regional territory during the 2024-2025 hunting season. The issue emerged during the meeting of the Regional Wildlife Council on 31 May 2024, where the new hunting calendar for the 2024-2025 season was illustrated. At that meeting, the representative of the local authorities expressed concern about the increase in the number of foxes that are increasingly approaching residential areas, creating numerous inconveniences and risking spreading diseases. In this regard, I would like to point out that between 2023 and 2024, the competent bodies confirmed 56 cases of distemper on foxes and mustelids in our region. Although not dangerous for humans, distemper is a disease that directly affects wild and domestic carnivores, especially young dogs. It manifests itself with problems in the nervous system, which risk causing possible paralysis, or with respiratory complications. It spreads through direct contact, through urinary and fecal excretions or through contaminated food. Foxes are also a target species for rabies health surveillance. I would like to reiterate that in our Region there is no limit on the killing of this species and that the hunting calendar does not include any merit rating in this regard. However, the Regional Committee for Hunting Management has the power to assign merit ratings for the killing of this animal through internal regulations. The proposal to encourage measures to reduce the fox population was therefore accepted at the Committee meeting with resolution no. 22/2024 of 8 August 2024, which, in its autonomy, decided to assign a merit score of 0.5 points for each fox killed and delivered to one of the control centers present in the regional territory. This document also specifies that the fox must be regularly registered and housed. The interest on my part and that of the competent offices regarding this issue is concrete and constant, as already reiterated in my response of 4 November to Legambiente. In light of the critical issues related to the disposal of the carcasses that were reported to me, as well as those reported to the offices of the Department of Natural Resources, I personally reported to the Committee, which issued an information note on 18 October on the correct management of killed game animals."
48005,XVI,21/11/2024,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,4,1183,"Thank you Mr President and I thank the Councilor for the answer and for clarifying what happened. I was inspired to present this question by the fact that Legambiente sent a letter to the Councilor highlighting an excess of hunting for the fox species. Starting from the assumption that fox hunting is foreseen, as the Councilor has rightly pointed out, in the 2024-2025 hunting calendar in stray or harnessed mode, what surprises me is Legambiente's report. Personally, I have been hunting for eight years and I have never come across carcasses of foxes killed and abandoned in our woods. Among other things, I would like to point out, as the Councilor has also rightly pointed out, that foxes are wild animals and as such must remain even away from urban centers and much less are they animals that can be dangerous and harmful. For this reason, an increase in slaughtered animals can be linked to a possible spread of some disease, such as rabies or distemper, or simply to correct hunting management. At this point, we take note of your response, which we share."
48006,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,3314,"The question proposes four questions regarding the snow park in Gressoney-Saint-Jean, the first asks whether the authorizations that were missing in March 2024 have now been acquired in full and that they are precisely interventions for programmed snowmaking, referring to an answer given in the chamber precisely in February 2024 and March 2024. The authorization process with respect to a whole series of authorizations has moved forward, what is not concluded is the issue of the registration of the slopes and the acquisition of the areas and however the procedure for the expansion works has been regularly entrusted, the interventions however have not yet been able to begin. ""If it is true that at least one owner has not made his land available for the purposes of the snowpark"": yes, it is true that one owner has not made the Monterosa area available pursuant to law 9/1992, authorizing, however, only for the 2024-2025 season, the management of the area in the configuration prior to the start of the new authorization process. ""If the aforementioned moving carpet will actually be brought to Staffal"", it was mentioned in the introduction: ""Taking note that the long moving carpet would be brought to Staffal..."", yes, also because for the second season it would otherwise have been unused, this does not create problems for the future because there will be a regular application for funding under law 8/2004 for the purchase of an additional carpet that will be allocated to the Gressoney-Saint-Jean snowpark once the authorization process and the procedure for the implementation of investments have clearly been completed, so also to avoid maintaining an unused infrastructure this choice was made, but this does not affect future investment work. Point 4: ""whether the Weissmatten snowpark will open regularly for the winter season and if so whether in full with all the conveyor belts or only partially"". The snowpark will open in its previous configuration and prior to the start of the new authorization process, therefore with the service proposal that has been used up to now, therefore there are no stops to the service and at the moment the proposed investment is not feasible in accordance with the problem that has emerged, but which is obviously being evaluated by the owners. In the past few days, the questioner, Councilor Minelli, and I received a note from the owner, who I do not know, I learned about it first informally also from the colleague who does not know her either, who wanted to give her version of the facts regarding the current situation. I spoke to her personally, I asked her if I could also send this note to the company to have its own version also in response to the things that have been anticipated. In the next few hours I will send both communications to the Group Leaders so that they have full knowledge of the things that are being exposed and of the situation that is in place at this time regarding the use of the area. What I believe is important is to clarify that the snowpark will open in the previous configuration, all the infrastructures will be used as proposed up to now and the process will be completed during the year to then make the investment for the 2025-2026 season."
48006,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,4531,"Thank you for your reply. The Councillor said that, in replying to his colleague Lavy last February and then to me in March, he had gone into the merits of the snowpark issue, that our initiatives were more generally in the Weissmatten area, but we had also addressed that issue and it had been explained to us that the conveyor belt was not in operation at that time, both because - this was what the Councillor had said - there was rightly not enough snow (we had also discussed what could be brought as snow and I had been told that many trucks had to pass, in reality with a snowcat you could move the snow...), and then because - it had been rightly said - not all the authorisations were available and among these authorisations the procedure for obtaining the availability of the areas had been mentioned. We also know that the conveyor belt had been dismantled to start the artificial snowmaking work, which however at the moment is not there and is not concluded. Then we learned of a further critical issue from the territory, which was precisely the lack of willingness on the part of all the owners to allow Monterosa to install that carpet, so we presented the question to know the state of the art. I had also checked the situation, before filing, because the work on laying the carpet, the usual, traditional one, had not even started, then instead in the days immediately before the Council I verified that something had started. Now on the issue of the authorizations the Councilor says that the process has moved forward, but it is not concluded, because he confirms to me that there is a problem related to this owner. He also said a little while ago that we both received this letter; I also do not know the Lady, I have not called her, but I have read what she wrote to us and I am happy that the Councilor in some way accepts the will of the Lady who asked to read the letter in the Council, it will not be read but will reach the Group Leaders, but in essence - and this seems correct to say - what is it said? It is said that there has always been a willingness to give the land, both that of the snow park and others that this Lady in Trinité owns, to the Monterosa company to carry out its activities, but in compliance with the contracts, contracts that have been declared valid, even recently by a ruling of the Court of Appeal of Turin, which condemned the company to pay a arrears until 2018 or 2020, I don't remember, then the situations of the following years will remain to be verified. However, there is a willingness, and this is highlighted in the letter, also to discuss these contracts, there is no unilateral position: either everything is kept standing or it is done like this, or we do not give any authorization. And what strikes me is that there is not, on the other side, an equal willingness to discuss and negotiate, because, from what we understand - and then you will see - in response to a still recent letter or a communication, I don't know, I don't remember the formula exactly, that the owner gave for the availability of the land, in compliance with the contracts, the response was a letter stating that the contracts are being rescinded! Now I am not an expert, I don't know if it is possible to unilaterally rescind a contract, I don't know, but it seems to me that, from the point of view of the attitude, there is something that is not right. Then there was also the announcement that an appeal will be made to the Supreme Court, but the Councilor had already anticipated this in one of my responses some time ago, precisely when I spoke about that ruling in his response in the chamber. What does this mean? It means a waste of money for everyone, it means time, it means a dispute that could go on again for a long time. It would seem to me much more useful for everyone, for the community then, at the end of the day, that we sit around a table and discuss in a calm manner. This does not happen. The Lady asks, among other things, to be treated with education and I have no doubt that this request has some foundation, because we know well, we have seen many times how things work... so you will have the opportunity to read and make your own assessments. My invitation however - and I do it through the Councilor obviously, because he is the reference Councilor - is that with the company there is the possibility of arriving at different attitudes, because this does not take us anywhere."
48007,XVI,21/11/2024,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,1,4282,"The question asks two questions, the first: ""whether the Consulta for cycling mobility has been formally established and has begun its activity""; the second: ""whether it can be convened in good time to provide useful information for the purposes of participating in the notice relating to the aforementioned call for tenders"", reference is made to a call for tenders from the Municipality of Aosta. As regards the first question, the Consulta is in the process of being established, we have sent letters to the Departments, to the bodies, we are also looking - we talked about it just the other day together with a member of an association that represents cycling mobility - the methods for assigning the composition of the Consulta to the reference associations, so this is a work that is in progress, because, as we know, there are members to be appointed who represent the Departments, the CPEL, but also the reference associations, so we have also consulted CONI on the matter, so there is a work in progress. We are establishing the Consulta and we are also completing the establishment of the office that will deal with sustainable mobility. An official has been hired, obviously through a competition, and the further assignment of an accounting assistant has also been carried out, which will finally allow us to have - if you will probably remember it even from the time of your period as Councilor - a structure that can govern future planning, both for everything that cycling mobility will have to represent, also for the regional transport plan, and the coordination actions with the various Departments. I remember that the Tourism Department proposes cycling mobility to make it grow as an attraction and as a possibility, on which to give opportunities for fun in the free time of both the people of the Aosta Valley and those who will be our guests and the Department of Councilor Sapinet is responsible for the implementation of the investments. Therefore, the task of the structure that has been built and that will become increasingly operational in the coming months is an important task, also of coordination with all the subjects that can help us to grow cycling mobility, especially soft mobility in the Aosta Valley. As for point 2: ""whether it can be convened in good time to provide useful information for the purposes of participation in the notice relating to the aforementioned project"", it will depend a little on the response times now; surely the Consulta will begin its activity between the end of the year and the first days of the new year, because I imagine that this could be the objective for everyone. With respect to the notice, we had the opportunity to speak with Councilor Sartore in the municipality of Aosta to also coordinate on the objectives that the Municipality intends to achieve with this proposal and also to ensure that a useful working table with all the subjects is activated in any case, taking into account that there will be this important notice, but above all that these activities will continue and the role of the Consulta will be important precisely to have the opinion of all the subjects around the table to develop projects in line with the objectives that we intend to achieve. The guidelines for cycling mobility are contained in the general plan for urban and extra-urban cycling mobility of the Ministry of Infrastructure and were drawn up in Valle d'Aosta in 2019 in the first draft of the regional plan, even if it was then postponed due to the issue relating to Covid and we are now resuming the activity that will lead us to have, within the proposal of the regional transport plan, also a renewed edition of the plan for regional cycling mobility. There are therefore numerous activities underway, also an important connection with both the Municipality of Aosta and with the local authorities and full operation will take place in the coming months. I must say that, hearing a little from all the parties interested in the objective, there is pleasure and interest in starting this work, which will be an important work to develop together, also to connect the many projects and investments that are in the area and the promotions that even the local authorities have started to make on the projects completed."
48007,XVI,21/11/2024,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,3,4330,"As the Councilor also recalled, we established, with the law that modified 16/2019, the Consultation for cycling mobility with the obvious aim of supporting policies and interventions in the field of sustainable mobility with a lower environmental impact. This question stemmed from the fact that we wanted to have an account of what had been sent forward so far, in particular to know if the Consulta had been officially established, we had also asked in relation to this notice that the Councilor cited, which is not a call for tenders from the Municipality of Aosta, but from the Ministry for Sport, a notice called ""Bici in comune"" and provides for projects for the implementation of cycling mobility in the various municipalities, initiatives related to cycle tourism, but also projects for schools, redevelopment projects and so on and the applications must be submitted between 7 November and 13 January 2025. One of the needs that exists to submit the projects is also to have some somewhat common guidelines for what concerns signage and other aspects, with a view to then having a cycling mobility platform in the future. The Councilor tells us that the Consulta is in the process of being established, so it is not yet formally established, and also hearing what he told us, that is, that it will become fully operational between the end of this year and the beginning of 2025, for the purpose for which I had asked for clarifications, that is, to give some indications also for this call, there cannot be a contribution from him. Beyond this, the will was also a bit to urge the continuation of the work, therefore really the establishment of this Consulta. You said, Councilor, that you have heard the reference associations because they must nominate their representative in the Consulta and also CONI, I imagine that among the reference associations there is Fiab à Vélo, because it is then the most representative, if not perhaps at this moment the only one we have in the territory. This is certainly very important, but what I would like to underline is that, when we talk about cycling mobility, we are talking about something more complex than a sport, a sporting activity, recreational, free time, that is, we are talking about a different way of moving, of moving people, objects, goods in some cases, therefore it goes in the perspective of a connection to the transport network through the use of the bicycle, therefore a Consulta that deals with cycling mobility, even if only for consultative purposes, because then this is what this body will do, it must take this into account and therefore not focus only or mainly on the sporting aspect. Well, the thing you told us, namely the implementation of staff in the Office for Sustainable Mobility, which is important, because we know that without resources it is difficult to follow the various issues. I would like to say one thing though: within this Council, where we know that people must also be nominated by the three relevant Departments, therefore your Department, the Department of Councilor Sapinet and the Department of Grosjacques, there would, in our opinion, also be an interest in having people like - I'm not saying that it has to be this - mobility managers, that is, people who have an idea of ​​what sustainable mobility should be beyond the aspects mainly related to tourism, because, in our opinion, even everything that concerns the ""Bike to school"" or ""Bike to work"" part, which is what is going forward in many places, would find its reason to exist in our region. The Council will therefore be established, I believe that it will really also have to have in its composition an attention to these aspects, for which obviously we urge attention. One last joke, two seconds, I'm so sorry that that project, that part of sustainable mobility, which was already in the 2019 transport plan, was then put aside because of Covid. I say this as a joke: this morning I received a cartoon from a friend that said: ""And then you realize that 2025 is in a month and a half and Covid was 5 years ago and 2050 is as close as 2000!"", so you have to be careful because time passes very quickly."

First of all, I thank my colleague for the attention he has paid and has paid to this issue, also for the constructive discussions held on the sidelines of the work of the Chamber. The interventions that the Regional Administration has promoted for the extraordinary maintenance and safety of the regional road network also include these works to improve the safety and redevelopment of regional road no. 8, from kilometre 2,100 to kilometre 2,600, the second lot in the municipality of Antey-Saint-André, with a total amount of €585,000. The intervention consists of the reconstruction of a section of degraded masonry supporting regional road no. 8, included precisely between the aforementioned progressives, for an extension of 500 meters, in addition to the positioning of a new road barrier and the maintenance of the road surface. The works allow to complete the improvement of the safety of the aforementioned section, already begun with the previous functional lot, which involved the widening of the carriageway through the construction of a reinforced concrete structure for a total amount at the time of €1,125,000. As part of the planned works of the second functional lot, the construction of the retaining wall foreseen in the project and the related kerbs has been completed at the moment. Special New Jersey barriers have also been positioned to protect the lateral edge of the road. Currently on the section of the regional road in question the alternating one-way system has been removed, therefore a two-way traffic system has been restored, without limitations. Finally, we inform you that the installation of the road barriers and the asphalting of the section of road will be planned for next spring, also considering the climatic conditions of the period which are not compatible with such works. I would also like to add that in the next few weeks we will meet with the Municipal Administration of La Magdeleine, a consolidation intervention is planned for the bridge that leads to the capital and the town of La Magdeleine following the monitoring carried out in the years 2021-2022, the creation of an alternative road, so as to then be able to intervene on the bridge, an intervention that was rescheduled following the flood event."
48008,XVI,21/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Strade di interesse regionale",en,Planaz,Dino,1972.0,M,RV,4,1041,"Thank you Councilor for your response. As you have already expressed in your response to my question, beyond the fact that I frequently travel that stretch of road, I had received many reports of the fact that more than anything else there was this one-way system that creates difficulties for traffic. We certainly understand all the difficulties of the companies that have to complete the work and perhaps within the expected timeframes or perhaps the inconveniences that exist, also due to the flood of last June 30, which created further changes of destination, of contracts of the companies that had to concentrate their energies to go and give urgent answers, where perhaps there was most need. The circulation has been reopened, even if we understand very well that, as far as the asphalt of the roadway is concerned, it will go in the most appropriate period, because we know very well that at the moment it is not possible. We thank you for the collaboration that has been there because in this way we have given an answer to places that really needed it."

Our colleague questions the regional government to find out what the state of the art is regarding the interventions related to the safety of the area affected by the calamitous event this summer, as well as regarding the installation of the bridges of the walkways functional to the connection of the two banks, as well as access to the slopes and numerous tourist facilities in the area. Following the flood event of 29 and 30 June 2024, the Hydraulic Works structure carried out the activities of clearing the 500 meters of the Cervino torrent that cross the town of Breuil, personnel of the Hydraulic Works structures, whom I thank because, when a part of them was operating in Cogne, the other part of the structure monitored the situation in Breuil-Cervinia with even some employees who returned from vacation in a very short time, therefore something also worthy of mention. Subsequently, parapets were positioned in place along the bank of the watercourse and concrete New Jersey barriers to increase the safety margin compared to the previously existing conditions. A reinforced concrete wall was then rebuilt on the orographic left to protect the watercourse upstream of via Carrel. These interventions are currently concluded. In parallel with these works, a punctual monitoring system was installed on the watercourse that is able to identify the passage of a debris flow in the basin upstream of the town. The monitoring system, once installed, was handed over to the Municipal Administration for its operational management in terms of Civil Protection, a system similar to the one positioned the previous year following the events of Bionaz and Oyace. A task was then assigned to study and design works in two separate sections of the Cervino torrent, which concern in particular two debris flow containment basins that follow one another immediately downstream of runway no. 5 and upstream of the town and then the reconstruction of the Cervino torrent banks along via Bich up to the confluence with the Marmore torrent, modifying the slopes of the riverbed and transforming the via Carrel bridge, which is currently a vehicular bridge, into a pedestrian bridge to allow for the disposal of flow rates comparable to those that occurred during the event at the end of June 2024. The detailed aspects in the urbanized section will obviously be the subject of discussion and consultation with the municipal administration. The designers in charge are completing the technical-economic feasibility project for the intervention as a whole with the aim of obtaining the opinion of the Po River District Authority. This opinion is binding for the financing of the works through state funds from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security, which amount to around €8,100,000. The executive projects for the works will then be drawn up, works that are intended to be started at the beginning of next spring. As for the walkways, the Municipality of Valtournenche has provided for the installation, exclusively - this must be specified - for the winter season, three crossings to connect the center with the ski slope area and with the tourist facilities."
48009,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSETTO DEL TERRITORIO, Difesa ed uso del suolo - Sistemazione idrogeologica",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,4,1999,"I'll start from the bottom, actually the passage that you made only for the winter season... we hope that the three walkways can return to 5, or in any case that there can be the same possibility of passage that there was previously. I don't know what the situation is today, but unfortunately, walkways were placed, when the snow arrived, the walkways cannot be crossed because the shoulder of the walkways has not been completed, so the walkways essentially, from the information I have, are not usable because the snow has arrived, so we hope that as soon as possible the shoulders of the bridges and walkways can be completed in such a way as to make the passage usable, because otherwise the work would be useless. There is also an issue related not only to reaching the bottom of the slope, the start of the slope or the start of the Cervino facilities, but also a safety issue, because the premises are in any case beyond the bridge and, in the event that there is a need to pass an ambulance or something else, there is a need not for a walkway but for a bridge as there was previously. Having said that, we, as we had already announced during the discussion of the Economic and Financial Document with the agenda, will continue to monitor the situation and we reserve the right to take further initiatives precisely because, I repeat, there is a desire to keep an eye on an area that has been worked on, that will need to be worked on, because, as you yourself said, it is not that everything is over, there are steps to be taken forward. We hope that it can be redeveloped and made safe, as has been invested in and as will be invested upstream to avoid a repetition of the situation. It is an area, among other things, that in season is heavily urbanized and therefore requires greater safety. In the short term, what we hope for is that the walkways can be made available to citizens and tourism operators as soon as possible."
48010,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Alcolismo e tossicodipendenze, Politiche giovanili",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,7516,"Coming to the first question, that is ""knowing what actions are implemented to combat youth distress"", more specifically the intake of substances that alter the perception of reality, the so-called ""youth distress"" is a concept that, in reality, simplifies a series of emotional, psychological and social difficulties that young people can experience, including individual, family, school, social and cultural factors. The complexity of the phenomenon can translate into different situations that range from substance abuse to full-blown psychiatric disorder, to marginalization, to school dropout and lack of prospects; therefore it is clear that the appropriate response cannot consequently be either unique or the exclusive responsibility of healthcare. However, coming to the healthcare world, the service for pathological addictions, therefore the SERD of the USL Company, currently provides a multidisciplinary team dedicated to minors, that is, young people and adults up to 26 years of age, which is composed of a psychiatrist, a nurse, three psychologists psychotherapists, a social worker and a professional educator. The care of patients who turn to the SERD involves an initial phase of multidisciplinary reception and diagnosis that includes several interviews with specialists. This is followed by the return of the individualized therapeutic plan in which a diagnosis, the objectives to be pursued, the expected results, the methods of implementing the various interventions to be prepared, the times of implementation, the times of verification and evaluation of the processes and outcomes are defined. These are also identified, with respect to the operators in charge of the case on the basis of the therapeutic program outlined. It is therefore important to specify that the abuse or dependence on narcotic substances, rather than drugs, alcohol or screen in minors and/or young adults, almost always represents a secondary and associated phenomenon that originates from a problematic psychic functioning in evolutionary development. From a more strictly psychopathological point of view, in addition to dependence, various disorders can be highlighted, of personality, of learning from attention deficit and hyperactivity, of conduct rather than of the psychotic spectrum. According to the prevalent pathology or the relevance of the problems, the SERD, therefore the addiction service, directs to the competent service according to the memorandum of understanding or agreements between services, therefore either to child neuropsychiatry or to psychiatry, in cases over 18 years of age, and/or to the psychosocial services of the minors area. The types of services provided by the SERD are psychiatric medical visits, psychological interviews and psychotherapy, educational and social interviews, nursing care, the intensive outpatient alcohol detox program, psycho-educational groups for both minors and young people and their families, the smoking cessation clinic, the clinic for the innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation. The latter, which we approved, among other things, in September 2024, is for our Region - the first in Italy - free for resident patients affected by pathological addictions and psychiatric and neurological disorders, therefore included in the additional regional LEA. Other Regions are studying and copying it, but applying dramatic costs, naturally outside of any additional LEA coverage. As regards prevention, we recall that it represents the SERD through a specific work team and is responsible for organically and stably starting a series of initiatives whose purposes are: intercepting young people before they begin to show discomfort through the use of substances, therefore primary prevention, or with compulsive behaviors and/or before they become dependent on them, therefore secondary prevention; reducing social and health costs related to the use/consumption of old and new generation substances; constantly monitoring the phenomenon of substance use in our region. The health promotion projects in progress are the following: the SERD prevention initiative program for the 2024-2025 school year, which includes interventions in schools on substance addictions and compulsive behaviors; the listening desks; the Legality Week in collaboration with the Permanent Technical Table on Legality and Intergenerationality. Also of strategic importance is the Youngle VDA project, funded with state GAP funds, on pathological gambling, recently launched through an application to be installed on the mobile phone that offers a virtual space where adolescents can chat by representing their problems anonymously among themselves, therefore without hierarchies and therefore among peers. This is the most innovative and functional aspect: young people talk to other young people who are specially trained and constantly supported by a psychologist and a specialized educator who therefore provide support and guarantee timely and professional responses to the needs of the kids involved. There are also numerous collaborations with the school world of the Department of colleague Guichardaz through the Permanent Technical Table for Intergenerational Legality, of the schools that adhere to the prevention initiatives promoted by the SERD and for each school year and in the schools where the SERD desk is active, of the class councils, offering advice and discussion for the students who are in the care of the SERD itself. Networking is therefore also guaranteed thanks to the various technical tables and working groups that have been established over time, therefore the Permanent Technical Table on Intergenerational Legality already mentioned, the Working Group on Bullying, the Interinstitutional Table for the Prevention of Suicide, the Working Group on Mental Distress in Adolescents. With respect to the fight against bullying, with Resolution 681 of last June 2024, together with the offices of the Departments of colleagues Guichardaz and Grosjacques, we have started the process of analysis and planning of a project aimed at experimenting the anti-bullying certification model in our region. The projects that are being carried out are precisely aimed at rationalizing the current dense network of collaboration between different bodies and sectors, health, school, training, work, justice, to ensure as early and effective care as possible. We are therefore convinced that it is increasingly important to speak openly about forms of distress, as we are doing, for example, together with the association Il Mandorlo fiorito in the area of ​​suicide prevention, both to break down stigma, fears and prejudices, and to bring people closer together by increasing the sense of community. We must deploy every useful tool to support our young people who need to develop greater resistance to the negative influence of some social models of our times. The goal is therefore to help them increase self-awareness, promoting self-protection and psychophysical well-being. Last but not least this Monday in the resolution on needs and in the allocation of resources for all services for minors we have naturally increased both needs and allocations."

The complaint that had been made by the Director of the SERD who had reported alarming numbers had raised a series of questions and concerns in those who had read these data. I recall them only for the benefit of the Chamber, numbers that tell us that there were 166 young patients in the first half of 2024, therefore 166 young people in six months, 49 in the age group up to 19 years, 117 between 19 and 25 years. Unfortunately, the Director of the SERD defined it like this: ""the most drugged era in human history"", it is certainly a danger, a serious danger that unfortunately the young generations are running and, as has been said - and, in my opinion, it is absolutely important - we must not only treat and take care of intercepting this type of criticality, therefore of dependence and bring people rightly from a condition of dependence to a condition of freedom, therefore of independence, but we must go upstream, therefore try to intercept what are the factors that lead to this type of dependence and understand and imagine that there are 166 young people who unfortunately fall into the spiral, this only as regards addictions, it must make us reflect on the dangers of modern society, which in many parts defines itself as open, defines itself as more inclusive, more tolerant, freer and so on, but then in reality we look at the data and we realize that there is an often underground malaise, which certainly should not be ignored. I thank you for your response and obviously we will analyze in more detail what you answered us."
48011,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5302,"Let's start by answering the questions: 1) what is the current status of the works concerning the construction of the G3 building for the expansion of the technological plants; 2) what complications are causing the accumulated delay that has reached almost a year since the announced start of the works for the construction of the G3 building. It is important to first highlight that, while the work in this room in the previous sessions was partly concentrated on providing correct answers to the concerns regarding the hospital bicycle parking or the temporary inconvenience caused in Via Guido Rey for the works for the construction of the Community House, an inspection was carried out in the construction area between the USL Company and SIV to close the overall delivery process of the construction areas which then materialized from the USL to SIV on November 13th. The theme of the Hospital, and therefore also of the financing of the G3 body of technological centers, was at the center, as also recalled at the last Council, of an important and fruitful meeting in which I participated with the managers of the Department at the Ministry of Health last November 12. On that occasion we learned favorably, from the Ministry, that our Region is among the best in Italy for the spending capacity of state financing granted as an investment account, therefore for the object of the financing of this initiative. More precisely, the Aosta Valley has completed over 80% of the financing lines for approximately 68 million and for the remaining 20 million, for approximately 17 million, it is in the process of being implemented. English: The works for the construction of the G3 building were started last spring and in particular involved the construction of the new gas line, the placement of a new reduction cabin near via Chaligne to serve the Hospital, the construction of some plant works inside the existing premises used as technological power plants, aimed at being able to reconnect the new gas reduction group, the construction of an embankment, therefore an accumulation of earth created artificially and functional to the maintenance of escape routes and safety of the hospital facility, the coordination with the activities of other companies operating simultaneously for works in progress in the hospital facility. As we have already reported in response to questions on the same subject, the works for the construction of the technological power plants required first of all to proceed with some interventions on the technological networks existing in the area of ​​interest. Some technical changes were therefore made from a design point of view with the aim of maximizing the productivity of the works and recovering the time dedicated to the transfer of the utilities. In light of what has been illustrated, we therefore confirm that the construction work on the G3 building has never suffered administrative interruptions since it began last spring. Coming to question no. 3 ""what consequences on the fundability of part of the interventions, using PNRR resources, can be determined in light of the accumulated delay"", in recalling what has been illustrated, there are currently no forecasts of delays in carrying out the works compared to the overall timetable. As for the sources of funding - and I believe you will be particularly happy about this because it avoids any type of comment on the answer - it is important to inform you that over the past months the intervention in question has been remodulated. As is known, the intervention of the overall expenditure, quantified at 6.5 million euros, included co-financing by the European Union for 2,763,013 euros under the PNRR entitled ""Towards a new safe and sustainable hospital. PNC mission 6 health"". Subsequently, Legislative Decree 19/2024 provided that investments intended for the implementation of the program called ""Towards a Safe and Sustainable Hospital"" - already financed by the PNC, a fund therefore complementary to the PNRR -, with the exception of those of the autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano and the Campania Region, are all to be charged to the financing referred to in Article 20 of Law 67/1988. In fact, this provision has therefore provided for a different financing path compared to what was initially defined and therefore no longer linked to the PNRR funds, but placed directly at the expense of the State. This issue has also in fact been the subject of extensive discussion and was confirmed at the meeting we held with the representatives of the Ministry of Health last November 12. The competent structure of the Department has therefore already started, in the face of numerous discussions with ministerial representatives, the remodulation of the financing and the preparation of the documents for the signature with the State of the program agreement that will replace the documents that originally linked the financing to the PNRR and PNC funds. For the third time I reiterate that this, among other things, was one of the topics discussed during the meeting of November 12th and one of the main reasons why the undersigned was present."

I was not aware of it and therefore I do not know well, I will ask you maybe next time, if this will certainly also lead to an extension of the times for the construction. I remember that almost 330 days have passed, therefore over 60% of the time expected for the construction of the work, but so far, as far as I know, not a single blow of the pickaxe has been made in that area, except for the movement of the gas as we saw this past spring. There will be a lot of work in that area, I remember that the external perimeter wall will have to be torn down, the protections, the sidewalks will be occupied, an excavation will be carried out for the medium voltage line, if I understood correctly, which will reach up to the gatehouse I imagine, but here we have not yet had the opportunity to have any prospectus, any drawings. The works are long, we have not understood at all what are the causes of this delay of over a year, you were quick, I will kindly ask you for a copy of your speech, because I was not able to follow you with particular attention, but what was the cause of this delay due, as you say, to a generic intervention on technological networks, it would be good to understand. In any case, I thank you for your reply, I kindly ask you for a copy of the text of your reply and we will keep our eyes wide open on this construction site."
48012,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,1077,"Coming to question no. 1 ""whether similar reports have been received"", to date neither the ASL Company nor the Department have received any reports on the need to extend the current daily parking limit to ASL employees in possession of a monthly pass at the Parini car park. Second question: ""Whether it has been planned to extend the maximum daily parking limit for ASL employees in possession of a monthly pass at the Parini car park"". The 12-hour working hours for staff, initially planned by the ASL Company at an experimental level, are becoming increasingly widespread by virtue of the appreciation shown by operators and the good results of the monitoring indicators. Therefore, given the excellent success of the experiment implemented, the company has communicated that it is available to examine in greater depth the contents of the agreement with the Aosta Public Services Company, the APS, in order to provide for an extension of the current maximum daily parking limit."
48012,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,1212,"Thank you Councillor. I am very pleased with your response. As we briefly summarised in the question and as you rightly recognised, the 12-hour shift, which was initially little used, is now increasingly used, the 12-hour shift is increasingly used and what happens? It happens that the parking is obviously 12 hours, but exactly 12 hours, therefore, since the parking is 12 hours, if I do a 12-hour shift, I will obviously arrive in the car park earlier, then I will have to get dressed, therefore I will arrive a little earlier, inside the car park I will have to get dressed, after which I will stamp my 12 hours and then I will have to go to the car park, therefore surely in this half hour or an hour more unfortunately it is inevitable that it will be foreseen. It is therefore clear that giving the possibility to those who have a season ticket to extend the 12 hours, therefore making a reasoning that inserts within the season ticket a possibility of a wider parking is certainly something that goes in the direction of favoring the health personnel of our hospital structure. I therefore thank you for your response and I hope that we can have some results in this sense soon."
48013,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,9731,"Before answering the questions in the question, we believe it is necessary to briefly summarize the path we have followed, which, according to the results obtained, reassures us and allows us to maintain that we are following the best possible path with regard to the subject of this question. In fact, we believe it is first of all important to remember that in the regional territory, in addition to the Umberto Parini hospital, there is only one other hospital structure: the ISAV, more commonly known as the Saint-Pierre clinic. This structure, as an accredited private hospital, has had collaborations with the USL Company focused for several years exclusively on the orthopedic field, also due to its single-professional nature. The agreement between the USL Company and ISAV therefore focused exclusively on the field of orthopedic surgery, both in the outpatient regime and in ordinary hospitalization, and on orthopedic and neurological rehabilitation services. More recently, we have encouraged collaborations also in the field of long-term care, not only orthopedic and day surgery, that is, simple surgical interventions that are resolved in a day or with a maximum of one overnight stay. It is important to note that the result that comes from collaboration in the field of long-term care, a type of service, a typical activity of the Saint-Pierre Clinic, is of fundamental importance for the entire regional health system. Thanks to the agreement on this service, in fact, the USL Company has twenty beds that it uses to be able to discharge from the Parini Hospital and the Beauregard more quickly, thus contributing to the disposal of the famous flows of patients who are waiting for admission to the hospital from the Emergency Room. The long-term care service at ISAV therefore helps to provide the best possible answers to the management of chronic conditions together with the other intermediate residence facilities already present in the area, such as Variney and Perloz. In order to enhance the activity of clearing waiting lists, at the end of 2023 we adopted a specific regional regulation, introduced with regional law 27/2023, which, among other things, gave ISAV the opportunity to perform general surgery interventions even in ordinary hospitalization, as never before, thanks to the hard work carried out together with the offices. General surgery interventions in ordinary hospitalization were therefore started starting from September 2024 following the conclusion of the administrative procedures for issuing the authorization and accreditation. Coming to question no. 1 ""the number of interventions performed in the year 2024 by private hospital health facilities under agreement, divided by type of intervention"", as we have already explained, the only accredited private hospital facility with which the USL Company has conventional relationships is precisely the Saint-Pierre Clinic. The number of operations performed during 2024 at the Saint-Pierre facility is therefore the following: orthopedic surgery operations, both inpatient and outpatient, 358, data referring to the period from January to July 2024; general surgery operations 177, of which 149 in day surgery, therefore simpler, with a maximum of one night's stay in the period from January to October 2024 and 28 in ordinary regime, therefore general surgery, which can naturally be taken into consideration in the period from September to October 2024 given that general surgery applied at ISAV started in September 2024. Coming to question no. 2 ""the costs in the agreement relating to the various operations"", the agreements between the USL Company and ISAV regarding costs refer to the regional provisions referred to in the resolution of the Council 427 of 2013 with which the general tariff for hospitalization services was approved. The regional resolution details the cost of each homogeneous grouping of diagnoses, which therefore represents the unit of measurement of the overall cost of each type of intervention. The resolution also classifies hospital facilities into two classes: A and B. ISAV, due to its characteristics, falls into class B, therefore the one to which the lowest rates apply due to the fact that some services are not present in the facility, such as the Emergency Room, resuscitation and intensive care, rather than instrumental diagnostics and laboratories active 24 hours. The agreements also provide for the measures of expense reimbursements for ISAV, which ISAV itself owes to the USL Company for the services performed and guaranteed directly by the same. Examples of this are the management of the transfusion service rather than laboratory diagnostics. As regards orthopaedic surgery, from January to July 2024, interventions were carried out for a total cost borne by the USL Company of approximately 1,813,000 euros. For general surgery, from January to October in day surgery, therefore the simplest ones with a maximum of one night's stay, the total expenditure was 176,000 euros. Coming to question no. 3 ""how many patients are currently still on the waiting list for surgical interventions and on the list for general surgery"", according to the data communicated by the USL Company, the patients on the waiting list for a scheduled hospitalisation, in all priority classes, as of 14 November 2024 are a total of 5,388, of which 1,466 on the list for general surgery. Comparing these numbers with those of patients waiting for surgery at the end of 2023 - which were 6,383 patients waiting for ordinary surgery, of which 1,975 for general surgery -, we can argue that the ongoing activities are producing their effectiveness, in fact in 12 months there are 1,000 fewer patients waiting, of which 400 fewer and therefore managed with regards to general surgery. The current data start from the situation described at the end of 2023 and represent a scenario today that, in the meantime, from 1 January 2024, has naturally also absorbed all the new flow generated during the year. Therefore, we do not only make comparisons between static numbers, but also from numbers that in the meantime have naturally seen waiting lists increase during the current year. Coming to question no. 4 ""what are the agreements foreseen in the agreement with respect to eligible patients, in particular what is the procedure for taking charge and the costs requested from patients"", as regards the agreements in force between the USL Company and ISAV it is necessary to distinguish two different cases that equally involve two different procedures for taking charge of patients. The first concerns the historical agreements in the orthopedic field, therefore those that have always seen the relationship between Parini and ISAV, which provide for interventions carried out under an institutional regime, i.e. at the expense of the regional health service, on patients who are included in the waiting lists directly by ISAV: in this case the users contact the clinic directly and access is permitted upon presentation of a referral. There are therefore no costs requested from patients for carrying out surgical interventions, with the exception of any ticket for complex outpatient services. The second case instead concerns the more recent agreements, activated between the USL Company and ISAV, with the aim of strengthening the disposal of the waiting lists of the Parini Hospital. This is the case of general surgery, both the day surgery regime, therefore the simplest ones, and the ordinary hospitalization regime, as well as orthopedic surgery operations arranged directly by the Orthopedics Department of the Parini Hospital. All this, of course, is the result of the agreements of the last year. In this case, the contractual agreements provide that the complex structures under the jurisdiction of the USL Company, therefore general surgery, orthopedics and traumatology, identify the patients who will be operated on in ISAV among those who are present within the waiting lists for scheduled surgery and who have a homogeneous grouping of diagnoses consistent with the surgical activities that can be carried out at the Saint-Pierre facility. The pre-admission office of the USL Company then contacts the patients following the priority code assigned by the surgeon during the visit and with which they were placed on the waiting list: priority index A, a hospitalization within 30 days, B within 60, C within 180, D within 12 months. The patient is then offered the option of undergoing surgery at the Saint-Pierre Clinic and, if the patient agrees, the office requires the completion and signature of the consent form for migration from the Parini Hospital waiting list to the list of operations that can be performed at ISAV. The Pre-admission Office then sends ISAV, via an encrypted file, the list of patients to be taken into care, contacting them and carrying out all the activities necessary for the surgical reassessment, pre-admission and subsequent admission. There are no costs required from patients and therefore, in this sense, the activity carried out at the Saint-Pierre Clinic is equivalent to the elective activity carried out at the Hospital. If the patient prefers to be operated at the Parini Hospital, he/she will remain on the waiting list and will always be called according to his/her priority class as soon as a place becomes available."

What I ask myself is: who decides the priorities? Because, seeing the broadcast and seeing the documentation brought, there was an absolute priority because this gentleman had already been waiting for over a year, after which I wonder how it is possible that all the things that you highlighted today in the interpellation are not said when the patient calls the department or calls whoever is responsible. You can clearly tell him that he is waiting and not scare him by saying: ""You will have a year ahead of you before an intervention"" if with a high priority there are 30 days, but then we tell him: ""You will have 30 days and you will not have to pay anything"". We have to tell the user this, because what happens in the next piece is very interesting, because, as you said, we do not live in Lombardy or in other regions where there can be some sort of doubt about which clinic this gentleman turned to, because there is one, therefore, from this point of view, it was quite obvious that he was turning to that clinic. So I wonder how it is possible that, if a private individual calls, there is some sort of negotiation, when, as I tell you, the resolution you made with the agreement is very clear and today you also explained all the money that is given precisely for that Agreement and, from this point of view, the patient was perfectly eligible. So I wonder who defines the priorities and at this point I also ask you if you can give me the answer given the complexity of what you told me and above all because people are not informed of the possible path they must follow, because I imagine that if you tell a person: ""But you are in high priority, so you have 30 days"", they have already waited 12 months, waiting 30 days would not have changed their life. Evidently this information - and there is also the part of the phone call right in Surgery - was not represented to them in any way, so evidently there is a lack of communication, which must be made explicit to citizens in some way to avoid things of this type. I hope you do not see this interpellation as one of the pleasant passages of the Regional Council, where almost all the interpellations are addressed to you; most likely because there is a big problem and there are many people who continue to call us, as I imagine you do, to try to report what is happening in Valle d'Aosta, something that has never happened and on which I want to point out that education and healthcare have always been the flagship of our Region, especially because both the pensioner without great resources and the person with many resources could still access services in the same way, today this is no longer the case and they must be accountable. Most likely there is a real lack of communication and above all I also expected a position to be taken with respect to an interview that ended up in a national newspaper, because we certainly did not make a good impression on that matter, because the report also came to me from outside Valle d'Aosta, so I would like to point out that we are certainly not making a good impression on the outside either."

48014,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5971,"Coming to the first question ""whether the ASL Company has carried out the assessment in relation to the activation in Valle d'Aosta of prostate cancer screening to intercept any neoplasms at the initial stage in the population at greatest risk and failing that when it is expected to be completed"", as was recalled in the preamble to the question, the agenda approved by the Regional Council committed the Regional Government to evaluate, in collaboration with the ASL Company, the activation in Valle d'Aosta of prostate cancer screening to intercept any neoplasms at the initial stage in the population at greatest risk. On 4 November 2024, the ASL Company acknowledged the request of the Department made following the approval of the aforementioned agenda. The Company specified the following in its report. First of all, he pointed out that at the moment only one Region, Lombardy, has planned to start a prostate screening program for that age group, an experience that has not yet begun, it seems it will start in November 2024, having as its sole target subjects born in 1974 and therefore foreseeing a progressive extension to the rest of the male population aged between 50 and 69. Obviously, those born in 1974 in 2024 have turned or will turn fifty. Lombardy reached this determination after a preliminary phase, in which a retrospective study by the Health Protection Agency, ATS of Milan, was organized from 2018 to 2023, a pilot project, a questionnaire for access to prostate screening, working groups - we recall the one regarding the minimum technological requirements, i.e. the acquisition and reporting of magnetic resonance examinations - and an operational protocol. The company explains that trials in this area of ​​cancer prevention are extremely rare for various reasons. First of all, clinicians point out that screening based on prostate-specific antigen, the so-called ""PSA"", remains a controversial topic due to the high rate of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment, which make the ratio between desired and undesirable effects of early diagnosis unfavorable, as PSA is not specific to tumor cells. It is possible, for example, to detect high values ​​of prostate antigen in cases of hypertrophy or infection without the presence of neoplasms. In fact, the problem is to correctly evaluate a possible positive result, as a high PSA does not mean that there is a tumor, or that it is more or less aggressive, or that surgery is necessary: ​​it only means that the person who tests positive deserves further tests in order to reach a correct diagnostic-therapeutic decision. Recently, a periodic urological visit and a specific instrumental examination, namely parametric magnetic resonance imaging, have been introduced as a complement to the investigation - and are mentioned in the screening protocol for prostate cancer in Lombardy in cases at high risk for PSA - which should be repeated annually. The Local Health Authority, following an evaluation of its clinicians, namely the screening referents, urologists and radiologists, therefore confirms all the doubts related to a similar methodology that uses a specific antigen. Clinicians maintain that it would be desirable to wait for a targeted examination that has the characteristics of contributing to early diagnosis with a smaller number of false positives and/or negatives, thus allowing patients to be treated sooner and better. I also report what was recently stated by Professor Francesco Montorsi, full professor of Urology at the Vita Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, who stated: ""The topic is delicate, it is important to keep in mind that, faced with a positive PSA result, it is not a given that there is a tumor and that treatment is not always necessary and we must always evaluate what is best for each patient, for each health service, remaining firm in the perspective of avoiding unnecessary interventions"". At the moment, therefore, we believe that, in light of the evaluations carried out by our clinicians, it is appropriate to remain carefully informed on the results of the Lombardy trial and above all on an ongoing project of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the CCM 2023, funded by the Ministry of Health, which is entitled ""Evaluation of the feasibility of organized programs on prostate screening and their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriateness of the use of the PSA test in the Italian context"" and which has a duration of two years, with partners: the Institute for the Study, Prevention and Oncology Network, therefore the ISPRO, the Azienda USL Toscana Centro TC, the Reference Center for Epidemiology and Oncological Prevention in Piedmont (the CPO), the ATS Pavia, the Lombardy Region, the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, the Azienda USL IRCCS of Reggio Emilia, the USL of Modena and the Puglia Region. The CCM project will assess the feasibility and opportunity of implementing organized prostate screening programs and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriateness of PSA testing in the Italian context. The CCM 2023 project will also provide the opportunity to develop a new generation of pilot studies on prostate screening and active surveillance studies of low-grade tumors that will be implemented after the project. This project was presented at the meeting of the board of the National Screening Observatory on November 8, 2024. These periodic meetings are regularly attended by both the representatives of the Department and those of the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority."

In this regard, first of all I would ask you if it is possible to have a copy of what you read to us, because, being a highly technical topic, it also becomes difficult to grasp the details on the fly during the illustration of the topic. From a political perspective, we appreciate the initiative that Lombardy has implemented because first of all it is an action of prevention and awareness on the topic, a topic that affects many people of the male gender and, as recommended by the European Union, we believe it is important to strengthen these screenings. It is a very widespread issue throughout the country, in 2023 there were 41,100 diagnoses, in 2022 8,200 deaths, it is the first cause of death from cancer in the male population. Therefore, from what we have heard, it emerges that it would not be appropriate at this time to go in this direction because this screening activity would lead to highlighting a series of false positives that would then increase difficulties and would put a burden on the local health authority for further investigations that are probably linked to inflammation or other pathologies. We believe that saving a life is important and therefore also in screening we must also run the risk of having situations highlighting false positives, which can then be addressed with further investigations, because many lives could be saved through early management of the problem from a health perspective. We will look carefully at this topic because it is a topic that is close to our hearts and we would not like to end up being the last in Italy, even if at this moment this activity has only been activated by the Lombardy Region, which I believe has made all the necessary assessments, also from a scientific point of view, because especially in a reality of that size, which is much larger than ours, it would have much higher repercussions than those you described at the level of our reality, which is a smaller reality and which could also, from certain points of view, behave differently because there are situations that can be managed better on small numbers."

The Aosta Valley Health Authority has in fact informed that, following a specific inspection, the reference spaces for the service have been identified and made available and that some adjustments to the premises are currently being defined, as requested by the Prevention and Protection Service of the Company itself. More precisely, two separate rooms have been made available: one for the emergency driver, one for the doctor, men and women. One of the two rooms is currently used by the Company's veterinary service and the person in charge of the territorial emergency, Dr. Cavoretto, whom we thank, reported that he found maximum collaboration from the contact person for the veterinary services, Dr. Ragionieri, whom we thank in turn, who immediately made themselves available to reorganize the spaces for their services. They also reported that the Verrès rescue volunteers, in the spirit of collaboration, gave maximum availability by making spaces dedicated to the car available. As we have already reported, we recall that in recent months the territorial emergency/urgency services have been the subject of a complete reorganization starting from the successful strengthening of helicopter rescue activities also during night-time trips. In this sense, we recall that our helicopter rescue and secondary helicopter transport services also intervene in the border areas in the Piedmont region with destination to the hospitals of the same Region. We also recall that this topic was, among other things, the subject of a broad and fruitful discussion with the Health Councillor of the Piedmont Region during the meeting held last 10 September in an institutional format. Due to the overall reorganisation of services in the territory and the new scenarios that have been created, it was therefore considered that the reference location for the medical car was appropriately identified at the Verrès polyclinic. In Donnas the service is guaranteed during the day by a medicalised ambulance and during the night by an ambulance with an emergency/urgency nurse. The location of the medical car, equipped with a rescue driver and a dedicated doctor at the Verrès polyclinic, which is equidistant between the Châtillon and Donnas locations, therefore presents itself as a strategic solution aimed at ensuring timely interventions throughout the valley floor area, including the surrounding side valleys. The medical car, in fact, during its shift from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am, can effectively support the nursing figures present on the ambulances that are in Châtillon and Donnas, who, as we have said, are qualified in emergency/urgency skills."

We, as a group, have presented this question simply because you, Councilor, had planned, as you well recalled, a medical car with a driver and rescuer in Verrès, but to date it is not there, I refer to the interpellation of June 19 n. 3744, where you, in response to my initiative, replied: ""From next July, at the Verrès polyclinic, a medical car with a driver, rescuer and a dedicated doctor will be permanently active currently in Donnas"". Obviously, as I have been able to ascertain, this medical car does not exist. Therefore, taking into account the will of your Department to guarantee effective assistance and urgency in the Lower Valley, we feel it is our duty to remind you of this. You spoke of the efficiency of the helicopter, which we agree with. To stay on topic, I would like to highlight the need of the users of the Lower Valley to create, in addition to the Community Hospital, also a first aid point, essential for a first aid intervention. We have highlighted it several times in this Council and also the colleague highlighted it perhaps two weeks ago, so I would like to highlight it too. Finally, I would like to remind you that the voluntary associations, important figures in managing the emergency/urgency, work in close collaboration with the Health Authority, guaranteeing a first aid service throughout the regional territory, but this important service requires an efficient health network. At this point, all we can do is wait for the medical car in Verrès."

Following the approval of regional law 7/2024, which reintroduced the contribution for the construction of the property in question, the offices of the Tourism Entities and Professions structure have begun preparing the implementing provisions aimed at regulating the methods of granting and disbursing the benefit, also with the support of the regional Expropriations and Valorization of Heritage and Casino structure, which I would like to thank - on the occasion of this answer - for the valuable collaboration that has been given to us. The resolution containing the implementing provisions was approved during the meeting of the Council on 14 November and identifies the date of 27 November as the deadline for the submission of the request for contribution by the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association. It was passed in the Regional Council on November 14 because the last opinion, the one that had to be issued by the ""State Aid"" structure, related to the de minimis issue, arrived on November 7. The Valdostana Ski Instructors Association, for its part, has prepared the technical-economic feasibility project and, following the adoption of the approved implementing provisions, is preparing the application for funding, which, as I said previously, must be filed by November 27. Following the submission of the application, the offices will carry out the necessary investigation with respect to the documentation presented and the work to be carried out, following which they will prepare the resolution of the Regional Council approving the investment in question and granting the relative contribution; resolution whose approval must obviously take place by December 31 and will include the commitment of expenditure. With a management provision subsequent to the resolution, the sums in question will be committed to the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association, beneficiary of the contribution referred to in Article 28 of Regional Law 23/2024, and disbursed according to the methods set out in the aforementioned resolution 1394 of 14 November last. At that point, the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association will be able to initiate all the actions necessary for the construction of the aforementioned property."

Honestly, we were a little worried not seeing any resolution of the Board in favor of this procedure. We are not so malicious as to think that everything was unblocked for our initiative, we know well that it takes days to prepare everything and you had certainly already started working on it well before our question, but there was a little concern, and also curiosity, to know if you were moving forward, because in fact we are almost at the Cesarini zone. We hope that there are no further obstacles and that we can do everything and deliberate by the end of the year, so as to be able to start all the procedures and also to liquidate with PD the 30% advance that I believe is waiting for those who have to proceed with the work."
48017,XVI,21/11/2024,CREDITO,en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,3499,"Here is another piece of the puzzle that was evoked yesterday regarding depopulation, banking desertification. The news of the closure of the Etroubles bank branch, which remained the only one in Coumba Freida, and also of the closure of the Antey-Saint-André bank branch is now over a month old... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...and also of Brusson says the Councilor. Then there will be the next closure of the Morgex branch; this news is absolutely negative, especially for non-digital natives, whose number is not so small anyway. Let's start from a premise: that these banking institutions are not public bodies, so rightly on the one hand they make their choices, their autonomy however often clashes with the needs of citizens, at least in several municipalities, which perhaps do not have such a large population, who, once the branch is closed, have to travel dozens and even dozens of kilometers to use a service. The data on the so-called ""bank desertification"" are alarming. According to UILCA, UIL Credito, Esattorie ed Assicurazioni, in Italy from 2018 to 2023 bank branches decreased by 20.7%, 5,248 less in five years, the Municipalities served by banks decreased by 13.4% and the employees of the branches also suffered a decrease of 6%. Again according to UILCA, which has also carried out some interesting surveys, nine out of ten people are dissatisfied with the closure of bank branches in their municipality and a good five out of ten declare that they go to a bank at least once a month. Seven out of ten people also declare that they have felt the lack of a bank branch in their municipality quite or very much. But why do banks decide to close their branches? Essentially for three reasons: the first is the reduction of costs, so they tend to close where there are fewer users in terms of population. Then there is the second reason which is the banking aggregations that have been made and a third reason: that of digitalization, because Internet Banking is increasingly used. Obviously, these arguments cannot be made on the skin of the citizens. Focusing a little more directly on the Aosta Valley, we have today 40 thousand Aosta Valley residents who reside in municipalities that do not register the presence of any bank in their territory; over a third of Aosta Valley residents, who have been deprived of access to bank branches from 2015 to today, therefore less than ten years, 18,500 Aosta Valley residents who reside in municipalities that have only one bank branch and 68% of Aosta Valley municipalities that do not have bank branches in their territory. These are data from the CISL Banking Desertification Observatory. Precisely because banking institutions are not public bodies, the room for maneuver is limited, but I believe that an attempt at least to understand the reasons why these bank branches are closed is absolutely necessary. We therefore ask with this initiative, in addition to a series of even more recent data, if there is the will to start a discussion table together with the Mayors, the Consumer Associations, with the heads of the credit institutions to understand in some way their reasons for the closure of these banking institutions in the territory and also understand what tools could be used to keep those open and, if necessary, encourage the creation of new ones."
48017,XVI,21/11/2024,CREDITO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,7389,"The requests of colleague Lavy concern the current number of bank branches and ATMs in the regional territory and how many bank branches and ATMs have been closed in the last three years and in which Municipalities. With regard to the statistical data of the 2024 annual report on the regional economy of the Bank of Italy, it can be seen that in 2013 there were fifteen banks present in the Valley with their own branches, in 2022 fourteen and in 2023 thirteen banks. With regard to the branches, the numbers are as follows: in 2013 there were ninety-nine bank branches in the regional territory, in 2022 they had dropped to sixty-eight and in 2023 to sixty-seven. The bank branches currently present in Valle d'Aosta, as per information provided by the branch of the Bank of Italy, are sixty-five, the ATMs are one hundred and thirty-seven, the latest available data for 2023. As for the closures, in 2021 there were sixty-eight branches, so there were three closures: one in Aosta, one in Issogne and one in Etroubles, while the number of ATMs in 2023, one hundred and thirty-seven, is the same as in 2021. This decrease in the number of branches is however slightly better, but in line with the overall Italian data, which sees bank branches decrease from 31,761 in 2013 to 20,161 in 2023. The Bank of Italy report then photographs another data, namely that the Municipalities served by banks in Valle d'Aosta were thirty-four in 2013 and twenty-four are in 2023, a data affected by the small numbers of the our reality, but in line with the trend in Italy which sees the Municipalities served by banks increased from 5,846 in 2013 to 4,651 in 2023. The Bank of Italy report also provides data of the opposite sign, as one can imagine. Home banking services, as also partially reported in the Councilor's evaluation, for families per 100 inhabitants in Valle d'Aosta went from 45.2% in 2013 to 78.3% in 2023 and online transfers reached 88.8% of the total and were less than 54% in 2013. The data on Bancoposta branches is also of the opposite sign, going from fifty-seven in 2013 to sixty-six in 2023, similarly to what happened throughout Italy. First of all, I would like to thank the Aosta branch of the Bank of Italy, in particular the deputy head, Dr. Paolo Emilio Mistroli, who allowed us to analyze this data and provided us with updates to respond in the most timely manner possible. As for the third question instead: ""if there is the intention, together with the Mayors and Consumer Associations, to start a discussion table with the heads of credit institutions to avoid the closure of bank branches and ATMs"", in the annual report from 2023 Banca d'Italia has dedicated a specific study to this topic, highlighting how between 2015 and 2022 the number of bank branches, in relation to residents, has decreased by 27%, in line with what happened throughout the Eurozone and not only in Italy, referring to this study, available on the Banca d'Italia website for other data, such as, for example, the presence of post offices, which mean that the overall number of municipalities in the Aosta Valley, without any banking service, drops to nine. However, in relation to the third question, it seems important to point out that the decrease in bank branches is due to the search for efficiency by operators, to which have been added the effects of technological innovations and new payment habits. In short, not only in Valle d'Aosta but throughout Europe the territorial network of banks has been downsized and one could even say that the banking sector is the last to arrive if one thinks of the progressive reduction or closure that began over twenty years ago of territorial offices and other services of general interest such as telephony, gas or other services also of state and public order. This said, also from direct experience, the discussions regarding the presence of branches on the territory and a comparison that discounts wide-ranging corporate policies with multinationals that have no roots in the territory and with which the opportunities for comparison on the part of the Administrations are really very limited, if not non-existent. We also add a strong implementation of electronic payment equipment, which now affects almost all economic, tourist and commercial realities of ours, like other territories, which over time have demolished the intermediation function of banks, as well as their increasingly specialized functions, which dedicate specialized personnel to the various categories of customers; customers who in most cases are reached at their businesses or residences or followed by appointment in a flexible manner, also demolishing in this case the need for a widespread territorial office. Then there are actions by institutions that seek efficiency, which often simply means cost reduction in the face of an implementation of standardized services. In this sense, the activity of the Region and the Institutions towards credit institutions also aims to create payment methods and procedures that facilitate remote services, with the use of specific applications and operating methods that can be implemented by mobile banking, which can neutralize the decline in classic territorial services. What we can do and have always done in Valle d'Aosta is to implement a series of actions necessary to keep the entire territory alive, inhabited and, consequently, interesting for operators and service providers such as banks. In short, I believe that the opportunities that are already implemented and the requests that are periodically put forward by the Municipalities, together with the Region, but mainly by the Municipalities, which once had slightly sharper weapons to be able to incentivize credit institutions to place a counter or an ATM in their territory, mainly linked to treasury services, which gave banks the opportunity to enter the fabric, including the socio-economic, of the territory and thus be able to grab a part of the customers... today these mechanisms are surpassed by other technologies and other innovations and even these opportunities, which were available to the Municipalities, with their resources and with their ability to provide a service to the community through a bank counter, are weakening. The contact is always there, it is there anyway and it is evidently à la une, especially on the part of the territorial entities, but in fact the change also in habits must lead us to work more on what can be facilitations, also in preparation for those who must re-adapt their system to the evolution of the services offered by the banking system. This is somewhat in line with what the Regional Administration is also doing to try to insert into the banking circuits a whole series of opportunities, also of direct relationship with the Administration, regarding, for example, payments or other situations that can directly touch the context of the Regional Administration in particular."
48017,XVI,21/11/2024,CREDITO,en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,2952,"President Testolin, I am quite shocked, also in light of the discussion that took place yesterday, it was said: ""We must guarantee services"", there was a chorus saying that we must guarantee services and I absolutely agree. Having bank branches means having a service on the territory. Now you have started to say that the world is rightly moving forward, there is innovation, there is also a change in habits and that therefore in the end we are in trend with the national level, we are also in trend at a European level, so who cares if they close a few bank branches, we are moving forward, it doesn't matter. Internet Banking is increasing and it would be interesting to understand if the percentage increase in people who use Internet Banking is a will or an obligation, because it is obvious that, if they close some bank branches in Coumba Freida, it is normal that then users must somehow learn to use other systems if they do not want to be left dry. She said it: we went from ninety-nine branches to sixty-five in about 10 years. So, if they are a service, that's one thing, if they are not a service, she said, also with a view to saving costs, let's do it like this... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...not the Region, because obviously the Region has nothing to do with it in this case, but we invite the banking institutions, in the name of saving, to close all the branches in the Valley, let's make the bank branches only in Aosta and we are all happy if then the issue is about saving costs. Then she said another interesting thing: that today the discussion with the banking institutions is non-existent, but with this initiative she asks if there is the will to set up a table, precisely to ensure that this discussion can be born. No, that's not good, it makes no sense to carry on with this discussion, when instead, for example, the Liguria Region, and also other Regions, have set up real Observatories on the issue of banking desertification. Now that they can have more or less positive effects of impact on avoiding closure is another matter, but there is a minimum of more attention. Here we pretend nothing is happening, that everything is fine, but yes, in the meantime we move forward, technology moves forward, innovation moves forward, who cares if the inhabitants of Brusson in the Coumba Freida of Antey have one less branch, we must necessarily move forward in the face of those who perhaps must remain in those Municipalities and do not have the possibility, due to age or due to many situations, to have access to Internet Banking. Honestly I would say make peace with your brain, yesterday you said something about maintaining services, today that a system is proposed to somehow not say to block, but to have a consultation with the institutions that provide services this is not good, it is useless. Truly and sincerely I have no words."

48018,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,2,1801,"At the end of October 2024, we learned from press information some observations regarding the too limited or insufficient presence regarding the number of public toilets present within the capital of our Region. We found that from the published news it seems that there are only five public toilets for a surface area of ​​approximately 35 kilometers. We emphasize that the numerous excellences and historical-cultural beauties present in Aosta have always been important strengths regarding the tourist offer of the Aosta Valley and, in particular, right within the regional capital for years several important events have also been organized, also in collaboration with the involvement and support of the regional Administration. Taking into account that, despite the territorial jurisdiction, therefore also the planning and implementation of the various services is the responsibility of the Municipality of Aosta, we believe that it is appropriate, for the reasons indicated in the premises, that the competent regional departments can commit to verifying the presence or absence of such criticality in the territory and, if necessary, can request greater attention and collaboration from the Municipality of Aosta, with the aim of being able to offer a better quality of general services offered by our well-known regional tourist resort. The competent Councilors are therefore asked to find out if they are aware of such news and if the reported statements correspond to reality. If in the case of an affirmative answer to the first question, there is the intention to engage in a proactive dialogue with the Municipal Administration of Aosta so that they can try to improve the overall offer of services present in the territory of the capital."
48018,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,2187,"English: Allow me to start off with a bit of a joke, I think that the Council offices had difficulty identifying the competent Departments in matters of public toilets, so between tourism and public works in the end the interpellation reached me, but that's a joke. Joke aside, I confess that I was not aware of the press reports to which the questioner refers, so I am not able to say whether the information corresponds to reality. However, the interpellation correctly anticipates it: the issue is not exactly the responsibility of the Regional Administration. I do not want to downplay the importance from the point of view of the tourist usability of the regional capital, but it should be noted, for example, that, on the occasion of demonstrations or events supported or sponsored by the Regional Administration, the placement of chemical toilets is one of the organizational and economic aspects, also in the strict sense of supporting expenditure, significant, given attention and carefully planned. For the rest, the Municipalities are not subject to protection or direction by the Region, but I am sure that those responsible for the regional capital will have taken note of the same press considerations that you have seen and will assume the relevant decisions. As regards the dialogue between the Departments, which from time to time collaborate with the Administration of the capital, I can guarantee that the management of the overall logistics is assumed by the organization of the various events, which evidently goes to size, in many cases also for questions, even before anything else, of security, the various services useful for the best use of the event. The dialogue between the municipal and regional structures, each for the aspects of their own competence, is in any case a practice obviously always followed and practiced, as well as indispensable to be able to guarantee good results and I am sure that we will continue to work on this with attention and professionalism, enthusiasm and maximum collaboration between all the bodies to improve even situations that are not at the top, such as those reported by the Councilor."
48018,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,4084,"I thank the President especially for the tone and the manner in which he responded in the final part, which demonstrated greater collaboration in order to try to resolve or report these critical issues compared to the initial joke, because in any case, even if it is true - and we were the first to say so - that the competence is municipal in the implementation of services, however, being a regional capital, a capital of interest as the word regional says and we all know that it is the maximum point of reference as regards the tourist aspect and also at a historical-cultural level of our Region, we thought it more than appropriate to present and report above all this critical issue, as we said in a proactive way, because in any case I believe that you too have had the opportunity to access this information. You simply have to go on Google, therefore on the most technological tools that are often reiterated even at the level of the Department, even by the competent Councilor, precisely how important the issue of innovation in digitalization is, therefore how important it is to have these increasingly performing tools. We must believe in it with words, but then also in reality they must work. If you go on Google, you see that there are five icons of the services, two of which say open, where there are three, there are three of the same bathroom and even one, for example, go to the one of the station and you see that it says: ""Closed, opens Friday morning at 06:00"", as if one needs that service from 06:00 in the morning onwards and not during other hours. This as a joke. The point was that we referred to the competent Departments because we believed that it could be the Sapinet Councilor, in collaboration, for example, also with the Tourism Councilor, given the contents of the premises, but the response from him that made a summary on the subject is fine. The initiative was presented at the beginning of November and just a few days ago, on November 18, as you also know, the news came out: ""Italia Oggi: Aosta, 22nd for quality of life, the regional capital loses 13 positions and, to determine these positions, reference is made to services and infrastructures, so we are not completely out of place with the initiative, but unfortunately the criticality is there, even if it is not completely of regional competence. The same speech, browsing topics that concern the initiative... if we go and see, at the end of December the same topic was discussed within the Municipal Council of Aosta where with a motion the theme of the criticality and scarcity of these services that exist within the regional capital was presented and the same competent Councilor of a municipal majority that for the most part reflects the same majority in terms of composition of the one we have here at the regional level, admits and says that there will be a decisive intervention on the matter. A year later, we ask ourselves if we have really and concretely worked in this direction, because obviously, if there are critical issues, we must also all try to resolve them together and this is a matter. Above all, we reiterate the issue of the quality of services, we mean precisely that attention in monitoring the most modern technologies available to us: Google and all the APPs that are available to us today. We therefore welcome the last part of your response, but the invitation is precisely to create synergy so that even these critical issues, which are often considered trivial or subdued, in the end we cannot also rent chemical toilets every time, because in any case they are also costs. If on the one hand we manage to resolve, making services stable and well-established with the necessary financial investments, we certainly manage to improve these services to the advantage of the Region, to the advantage of its image, at a national and international level."
