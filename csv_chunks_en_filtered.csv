On October 18, the government approved an agreement with the Grand Continent Foundation Geopolitical Studies group for the organization of 2024-2025 editions of the Grand Continent summit, which also includes the partial use of the Maison du Val d'Aoste. In summary, part of the Maison du Val d'Aosta will welcome the operational nucleus of the geopolitical study group which organizes the summit and which will help the region carry out activities and events of interest to the Aosta Valley in Paris, in the premises of the house or in other places. We have decided to experiment with this new form of use of the structure which intends to bring back the house of the Val d'Aosta to the original idea for which was created in 1999, namely not an information office on the Aosta Valley, but a place where to imagine and make initiatives aimed at presenting the Aoste valley in the various historical, cultural, linguistic and economic facets in Paris -or, perhaps, in other places in France - institutional relations between the Aosta Valley, France and La Francophonie; Where to welcome Valdotaine emigration, the historic and current one. The latest details are being definition to be operational before the end of 2024."

Above all, I thank advisor Lucianaz for this question which has the merit of highlighting an event, the 1966 plane accident during which Corrado Gex lost their lives with other seven people, which is still the subject of investigation. On the other hand, the question provides information on the results of the examinations carried out by the University of Milan, of which the regional administration is not aware.

As you know, this body, what remains of this body (the coffin, if you want), was removed 4 years ago and we made analyzes on this body, for two motivations mainly and that is to say: if actually belongs to Corrado Gex this corpse which remains, since there are doubts expressed by different people; Second, this is the question of the presence of neurotoxic gas that could be the cause of this accident. So, as the University of Milan has failed to give answers - at least we are still waiting for answers - after 4 years, something that is extremely rare, really it does not happen often, to keep a body in an analysis laboratory for 4 years; The question is that this body now is in Finland, from what I have learned, in an institute which is in the process of deepening its studies, but I believe that a character, to abandon the chronicle, such as Corrado Gex, deserves that the Valdôtain government and the entire Valdôtaine community take care of it, take care of the truth of what happened that day. This accident has not yet had definitive answers today and it is because of that that I personally and the group to which I belonged, my colleague Robert Luboz, we presented, on May 22, 2019, a motion by hiring the president of the region to try to obtain all the official documents and the results on this body; And now the president, at the time Mr. Antonio Fosson, had made the commitment and, unanimously, the Council had expressed itself to know this truth. So, I ask for an effort from this government so that the memory of Corrado Gex, as we are quickly approaching the 60th anniversary of the accident ... that he at least tries to deepen the question."

There is currently no situation concerning the Palafent structure which prevents its complete use from a sporting point of view, moreover, Monday, November 18 expired the time to submit offers to participate in the public auction, launched by the Federachon, for the management of the closed bar-restaurant, as we know, following the dispute with the Manager. With regard to the work requested by the Nohtra Téra Esport Federachon, I inform you that the following work has been carried out: the energy efficiency in the entire structure for a total amount of 350,000 euros; the intervention of the user water meter division; The replacement of the emptying pump of the collection reservoirs for wastewater and the remote control of its operation, on this point the Asssorate of Public Works reports that the problem exclusively concerned the caretaker's accommodation and not the evacuations of the toilets of the establishment; The global intervention to develop these drains, which is not essential for the use of infrastructure, it will however be scheduled soon after the analysis of possible intervention alternatives. In addition, the real estate structure and sports infrastructure of the Assessorate of Public Works, following the individualization of the new manager, will proceed with the Federachon to a joint inspection to verify the functionality of the electrical heating systems, the catering and accommodation parts of the goalkeeper and, possibly, carry out the necessary development and restoration interventions given the priority of our uses, which lasted more than a year. Finally, the Department of Natural Resources recently entrusted our services for the adaptation of the Automated Green Space Irrigation System, to optimize the creation of a lawn for their sporting actions, for a total of around 50,000 euros, works which will be completed, we hope very soon, between the end of the year, by the end of the year. With regard to the third point, we therefore confirm the attention of the regional government with regard to popular sports, both with regard to the Federachon and the sports associations which compose it, with regard to the structure in question; Proof of this is that during the year 2024, at the request of the Federachon, the budgetary allocation of 95,000 euros for traditional sports was increased to 150,000 euros, the additional sum of 55,000 euros was granted as an expense account necessary to carry out the vast activity carried out for the promotion of traditional sports in schools, given that the amount of the association had been unchanged for several years, For new activities. The FENT considers in particular to proceed, among other things, to a multilingual reprint of the brochure on traditional sports to distribute in schools of all levels, as well as at the extra -regional level and for promotional purposes, to participate in international activities organized by the European federations, to create a short video presenting the traditional Valdôtan games, by highlighting their social, cultural and geographic context to disseminate on networks on networks Social and Federachon's websites, but also international associations of traditional sports, as well as providing for the digitization of its documentary photographic archives.

Valley, so let's go back to 2021, because it is useful to remember all the steps. Recall that in 2021 during the discussion of the petition of the Vallée Santé Committee, not our resolution had been voted, although it had been voted in the commission, after which the five colleagues who left our group decided to follow another road, a resolution that asked for, urged the activation of a working table between the institutions, therefore between the region, the Municipality of Aosta and the designers, with the aim of verifying the technical, economic. and temporal of the project, especially in the light of the new challenges that emerged with the pandemic. This resolution, we remember, committed to proceeding with the variant of the executive project of the East of the Hospital, to continue the design phases of the renovation of the current hospital at the same time and end the definition and identification of the hospital services that would also have been activated taking into account the Pandemic, to start a comparison on the destination of the Beauregard hospital and the former motherhood, to present the project to the Valdostan population through more appropriate tools. Since then, a room has appeared right adjacent to the hospital, an info point, just close to the construction site, which I think you do not find great participation, I often pass in front of the hospital and I have never seen anyone within that small room and above all, seeing the slides that pass, if we are interested in the archaeological excavations, surely it is of great interest what is inside that video, but, if we are interested in what concerns the Valdostana health. We find. Many initiatives have been made mainly by our group and by the Valdôtain's Rassemblement Group to ask that, following that hearing on April 10, there were updates, this because I went to see me again that hearing, to recover the various steps and, apart from the fact that the designers were not present, so only this would deserve an audition, but on the other hand I also went to take that documents and to check that documents. Then arrived precisely following that audition and I can say that many of the questions we asked in that hearing have not found any answer to date: an example - of course I take the passages referring to my intervention - I asked to have an analysis on the adequacy of the operating beds and the consequences of the articulation of the hospital facilities, this because at a certain point, during the audition, there had been a question of double radiology, therefore a radiology in the old Parini. In the expansion, it was not well understood, even in light of the questions asked by the director Manfrin, what was the fate, for example, of the pharmacy, therefore on this point we absolutely had no answers. After that we also focused on the question of the limitations referring to the Elisuperficie in which we know well it will be put above the hospital, but we know the same, with limitations, to a flight a day compared to the possibility of landing on that structure. Then there were also questions from the director Lucianaz who had not been given an answer and that perhaps he will present him. I imagine that the commissioner will tell us: ""I have already come in the hearing on April 10"", if you think that the hearing of April 10 ... moreover there was also an intervention by the councilor Marquis, who said: ""but to make an audition without the designs, without having a knowledge of what is being done makes little sense"", therefore, even under the design point of view, most likely ... but this is the field of the councilor, Compared to those passages that had occurred on April 10 and that, in essence, gave space to new auditions, this is what seemed to us to grasp, or in any case also to send new documentation that we asked for that location. We then take the obligation to remember that, after that audition of April 10, thanks to the various initiatives, we learned from Councilor Marzi, on February 9, 2024 we had been told that the validation of the executive project was close to the conclusion. On 11 July 2024, therefore a few months later - the ""neighbor"" perhaps depending on the speaker is subjective -, again it was said: ""No, but it is a question of very little"". From that February 9 to 15th eight months have passed and over three years have passed since 2021. Moreover, as I remembered, during the discussion of that petition it had also said: ""No, but we must continue with the project, meanwhile with the design phases of phase 4 and 5, because so we have an idea of ​​the total costs for the entire hospital"", because, in my opinion, it is good to remember that the expansion will be only for the hospital for acute, so it is not everything we need. Nothing has been said about the fate of the Beauregard, even on this we have not had updates and also on the fate of the former motherhood, all things placed within that petition. With this motion, therefore, we ask the Councilor for Health Councilor to come to the Com Commission, perhaps even with all the documentation, within 15 days -because it seems to us that, given that over 8 months have passed, even if we put a rather short time, we can make it -, to come to present the verification on technical -progery and economic compatibility, as well as on the realization in adequate chronological terms of the expansion project of the Parini hospital. This is essentially that was foreseen in the resolution and of course also to present all the design variants and the state of the art of work in the different hospital principals, because the only certainty we have is that the Aosta Valley will never have a single garrison, this is the only thing that the Aosta Valley health workers asked and it is the only thing we know we will never have. We have also seen the resolution of November 4 that speaks to us of 178 million and here too we repeat that it is only the expansion and the designs, therefore not everything that is needed, therefore it would also be interesting to understand what the total costs are, if we have an idea, what the expansion costs, the demolition of the superfits, all the renovation of the old Parini, the construction of the maternal center, the movement of psychiatry and the movement. He puts on it and even when you think of ending all this, because one of the things we had highlighted and we continue to say is that we had absolutely needed the hospital and had to be decentralized, it had to be unique, it had to be ready soon. At this moment, however, we know very little. As I said, we surely know that it will not be a unique garrison, but we know anything about everything else. Maybe the commissioner knows, maybe he can already tell him today, but what we want is that he returns to the hearing in the meantime to provide the documentation requested on April 10 that we are still waiting, but then to ask the questions, because just go to see that hearing to understand that, having no idea what was inside that hospital, very few questions could be asked, so having the idea of ​​the beds. I also read - however, having been downloaded only today, I read the resolution quickly this morning - that in essence the Municipality of Aosta rushed problems with respect to traffic and on the other hand asked that the planned parking lots were also for use for other needs, therefore not only for those who went to the hospital, but for those who want to visit the city of Aosta, therefore also to understand respect not only to traffic, but we know how to be in the places we know. What will be the priorities that have placed in the project, because there was talk of two parking spaces every bed, it is normal that, if anyone can park there, those two parking spaces will most likely no longer exist. These are all questions that cannot be restricted in a debate of a motion and this is why we ask, for the umpteenth time, to come to the commission to present this project and all the vision that this majority has compared to this work, which, as I said, is of extreme necessity and which is becoming, according to our point of view, the greatest flop of this majority, but this is our vision. Let's see what the commissioner will answer us and we will also evaluate the next steps."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,11015,"Bondzor in Tcheutte. [Literal translation from the patois: good morning everyone]. The requests of colleague Guichardaz are sacrosanct, clarifications are asked for in the commission. Unfortunately it is a record that feels too often on this topic, but with the permission of my group leader, taking the floor, I must still give a little explanation for what happened yesterday. Yesterday I did not respond to a colleague who apostrophized me with a ""sucks, be ashamed"", etc., because I considered it decidedly absurd, instead, seeing today the unleashing of printing articles, at least on the classroom and to the listener, I owe two explanations, starting from the fact that yesterday I was commenting with a colleague of mine, certainly aloud, the fact of the methods of granting the word and I had no epithetic Word ... but so Padovani ... (intervention by the councilor Padovani, out of the microphone) also face sarcasm, colleague, but I do not listen to the stupid who says she, so don't worry. For this fact, I was condemned by several printing bodies, in particular the Aosta Valley agencies, the Pd resonance speakers and, patience, it is not the first time that these printing agencies report untrue facts, such as the continuous reference to the ""great straw"" that I would have pronounced in 2022, I have never affirmed a ""large straw"", but it continues to be reported with a virtue. With the colleague, however, yesterday we clarified, I believe in a peaceful and reasonable way, I also told him that, if you think it is offended, I apologize, I tell him publicly, I was not addressing him, so I think for me that it can end here. And if I have to other justifications, I have no problem supporting him. However, I believe that, chatting with a colleague, he can at least have the right to use the words I think. I repeat: with the colleague there was nothing and the epithet was not addressed to him, then everyone considers the fact as they like. The article instead signed by Piero Minuzzo I take the time to reread it because it seems to me quite worrying. I speak of the hospital and I come to the motion because on 4 December 2023 in the hearing at the Municipality of Aosta we heard several city councilors complaining about the fact that the technicians do not give answers, certain times and precise data were asked that even on that occasion they were provided, fortunately, that the auditions of the Municipality of Aosta are public, so we can cite them, true, president? Another opposition councilor expressed in front of the engineer who was relating: ""It is difficult to make a political debate without the presence of the counterparty, since the technicians act on the mandate, I would have made me very please to see the regional policy here"", other Renaissance group interventions, etc., therefore also the Municipality of Aosta have not been provided the answers that in this advice continues to ask. Let's go on, in the sense that, remembering that the executive design of the hospital of the new wing of the expansion was from 2013, I repeat: the executive planning then in 2014 the regional council stopped it, then the archaeological finds, etc. ... We have a declaration of the engineer who was planned to deliver the hospital in December 2019, you all know this, the newspapers also know. The fact is that they continue to ask for data that are not provided. This week we learn that with the modest sum of 178 and a half million the expansion of the Parini hospital is expected, therefore, in addition to the documentation that we hope will be provided, otherwise we will try to have it differently, in addition to the 31 -page report - and then I will resume some passages of this report -, wonders if these 178.5 million euros focus on the expansion, on the part of the Block K and Hospital Street, Excavation still to be programmed for the archaeological aspect allowing and here I would like to know by the councilor what it intends to do in that area that has not yet been excavated. He therefore wonders normally, and we will also ask for it in the commission, as much as the total of the works of the whole Parini complex will amount, including phases 4 and 5 of which we have absolutely no documentation. To return to block K, I remember that in the commission, that famous April 10, several questions have been raised, not all of them got answered, some summarize some to refresh the memory of the councilor, that is, if on the top floor of the Hospital Street, which houses a conference room, refreshment services and other things, if it means the floor below the connection tunnel between the two buildings and here it has not been replied; Where the bus would stop, if it narrows the roadway, indeed, the roadway often, for the works, will be restricted to a single lane and wondered where the bus stop was, where they crossed the pedestrians, if the sidewalks were not foreseen, on the rendering they are not indicated, as will be made to cross Viale Geneva in satin and how long the use of the second lane in Viale Ginevra will be expected. Here we have not obtained answers. The Hospital Street includes paths already separated in the pandemic perspective that had been so talked about in the Covid phase and the same for the emergency room, we have not obtained guarantees during that hearing. Did you still ask for vehicular access inside Parini, will it undergo changes during the construction of the Hospital Street? We know, at least so the engineer told us that the Hospital Street will be made of three sections, moving from time to time the current entrance to the hospital. It would be good to have somewhat clearer ideas. What do we know about their location from 118 which is currently near the concierge? The underground excavation for the passage of the pipelines will still be wondered, without obtaining answers, which will connect the Block K from the technological control unit, if the excavations are expected to find the stone circle in that area, as indicated by the International Scientific Commission, if the construction is expected in that area, so to speak, near the withdrawal center, of another archaeological area, as it seems evident, there is an archaeological finding. This was not given an answer and I speak of April, so more than six months have passed. It was still asked if the hospital complex, painted as conceived to position itself at the top of the energy and environmental sustainability parameters, I ask if the renovated Parini, therefore phases 4 and 5, is also planned there a photovoltaic system, machines and systems with very high performance, advanced sensoristic supervision systems, efficient envelope systems integrated with bioclimatic solutions, This has not achieved response as on stages 4 and 5 there is a total darkness on government decisions. We would like, since we talk about the new hospital, to have answers also on these sectors but have never been provided. Then the trees, the green area around this hospital but where do you foresee it? The only green thing on the rendering is the roof of the colored green buildings, but I wonder: does this seem to you a serious hospital? Again: from the images of the preliminary design of the old Mauritian, that is, the building that should be renovated and made full as it was at the origin ... I remember that the Aosta Hospital is a fascist work par excellence, in the images, those few and very rare images we have seen, has not been provided its original identity, so will the Mauriziano be placed as original or will there be superfits? Also on this, Councilor, it would be the case, after six months from that skimpy 31 -page report, even with several contacts, as we have pointed out during that hearing, which provided us with some responses. I still have a few minutes and I take advantage of it to talk about the parking lots, which have been reduced by 50%, I repeat, the parking measures are, from what I understood, of 4.20 meters, know that a compass Mercedes is 4.95 meters long, a pickup 5.20 meters, I would like to see how we can park them in that underground parking and all the other stalls have not yet understood where we get them. In a project there was a parking lot in the south-west area of ​​the current hospital, the technological control unit will now be built, I would really like to understand, and we have never been provided with an answer, where the creation of these stalls is expected. Finish with the enchanting, the incanstation is spoken of little and it will be the big problem if the work of this construction site will ever begin. Here we have a sequence of regulations to be respected, the rules on prevention, on compliance with safety, 2008 decree, the protection of hygiene on site is fundamental and I speak of law 300, we have the law that regulates the quality public works: the 109/1994, which requires the control by the administration at the inspection level, for evaluation of the projects by the contracting authority. The set of the two aforementioned regulations obliges a preventive verification to prevent the company's entrustment of the work from blocking the works, rightly demanding the impossibility of accessing construction site areas for supplies to perform the work. The engineer told us that the area intended for parking will be used initially, but I will point out to you, councilor, you should know, that there is a legislation that regulates the accidents and hygiene of the insiders, who, to be in order, will have to provide a series of prefabricated containers used as bathrooms, changing rooms, warehouses, offices, meeting room for works, refectory, which entails in the construction site. The occupation of a considerable part of the construction site area of ​​the parking lots that was indicated for the first phase of the works. Then there is the quality control during the works, where the obligation applies, in order not to be ousted from subsequent contracts, to comply with the control and differentiated storage of all the material used in the construction site. This therefore obliges the company to prepare adequate separate areas with each other, where to deposit everything, that the breaks and defects of the material are in perfect rule, etc. There is internal circulation, interference areas, loading and unloading, an impressive thing in that hole. You want to continue to make it there, you have embedded, it is your choice, they will pay the aostans and all the Aosta Valleys this disservice, starting with the same bikes that cannot even be brought inside the hospital, imagine the circulation, with trucks that must download, work means, material storage areas that you will have to identify in some area of ​​Aosta, etc. The criticality is enormous, at least it comes to report in the commission as required by this motion."

As you rightly recalled, I connect Guichardaz, it is not his fault if the motion arrives now, but it is not even my fault, so I reply Sic Stanitbus rebus to date. On Monday 4 November 2024, a date, among other things, which in history has brought peace, the regional council has expressed the positive evaluation of the variant of the executive project of the fourth lot, phase 3, of the new unique garrison of the regional hospital Umberto Parini. With the approval of the variant of the executive project, we effectively close the third design phase that goes to achieve what in the imagination of every Aosta Valley is actually the new regional hospital. In fact, the fourth lot of the third phase provides for the realization of the bodies K, L and P, then respectively the helical cylinder - which I understand that someone shows off, but which in fact is the hospital for acute, with the conservation and enhancement of the archaeological finds -, the Hospital Street, therefore the body L, i.e. the new entrance of the new hospital that corresponds to the current Viale Geneva and the extension of the car underground, The approval of the variant of the executive project in advance times allows the issuance of the decree of the President of the Region as a qualification to build, which will therefore follow the start by SIV of the public tender procedure for the construction of the work for a total amount of charges and VAT of € 178,515,453.96, of these euros 143,94.169.18 are for work and correspond. 7-8 months, to the update of the amount of € 139,663,000, reported on the occasion of the commission last April and inserted in the documentation on which we actually tired; Then I understand that someone may think is such a written level at random, instead it was not. The variant of the definitive preliminary design, coming to history, that she rightly restarts since the spring of 2021 when a resolution was voted in this advice and, among other things, it was also devoted by many colleagues who today are not part of this majority, but that at the time both the majority and the minority believed and gave rise to a series of actions absolutely consistent on this theme ... the variant to the definitive design preliminary to the executive one Prepared during 2023, while the variant of the executive project - and this, connects Guichardaz, I already told him by responding to an initiative of his colleague Lucianaz a short time ago - was validated by the RUP on 8 July 2024, after being concluded what you rightly recalled, that is, the verification ratio by the verifiers who had arrived on July 5, 2024. From the SIV Single Member Assembly, on 15 October last, the variant of the executive design of the fourth lot of phase 3 of the new Parini hospital. The variant therefore to the executive project confirms consistency with respect to what was declared on the occasion of the hearing in the board commission of 10 April 2024, during which the main functional and performance characteristics of the building complex were illustrated, therefore the fourth lot regarding phase 3, therefore the bodies K, P and L, the cantierist aspects, the synthetic chronoprogram of the main Milestone of the intervention, which is just as Recalled, and I wanted to do it on purpose, they have undergone variations, but in fact we are now talking about something that ended on November 4, the costs of the intervention and the schedule in progress. We therefore close the process of phase 3 in accordance with the resolution of the Council of 12 May 2021 by her recalled which committed precisely to proceed with the variant of the executive project to adapt it to the safeguarding and enhancement of the archaeological finds through SIV, both compared to what was reported several times in this classroom in order to the theme of the new hospital. We therefore declined the provisions of the Council Resolution 1180/2021, proceeding with the preparation of the variant of the final and executive project of the intervention of phase 3. Once the new hospital for acute patients can therefore be carried out, the activities and functions carried out in the current Parini may therefore be transferred, thus freeing the current hospital and allowing to start the renovations of the subsequent stages. It is clearly evident of how the new hospital covered a central element in the overall reorganization of health reorganization, as expected in the planning of the regional Defr, in the plan of health and social well -being, in resolution 1609/2022 inherent in the new territorial planning and in the new corporate act. I understand that in the game of the parties the policy says that we move random, without a compass, but in reality these are acting politics and the administration reason for acts, these acts are consequential with each other and are fully consistent with each other. All these actions will therefore gradually reorganize health, the networks of social and health services, socio-assistance and social, making the models of taking care of the health and social well-being needs more effective of citizens and our Valley community. To date and up to the publication of the relative tender, as required by the contract code, it is not possible to spread further material since it is reserved documents that will form an integral part of the works of the works, as, among other things, we have declared, therefore the project is the one presented in the aforementioned session of the V Commission. This aspect is a non -secondary aspect, which, among other things, has very important technical connotations and which, in fact, also causes some of the things that have been requested could not be given. This motion, for which we therefore ask for the retreat otherwise we will abstain, has never been voted before, but less than it is today. In fact, the ideological positions may remain, different from a political and administrative point of view: this council has collected a vital practice for our community and for the part of our competence we have all abhorred the inertia that brought the closure of phase 3 at home in three and a half years. We are not over yet, there will be a race, a construction site, the subsequent phases to be analyzed and concluded, but to date we have behaved with common sense, seriousness, working hard and seriously, so in Maiora and certainly at the top of the hearts. The object of the dispute is that all the things that have been said in the presentation of this motion are part of a recent past: from today there is a future for which this majority hopes that everything goes in the best way in a world that varies, full of risks and pitfalls. Those who still want to talk about things must realize that with November 4th we moved on to another era and another phase."

I repeat and I repeat: that will be the hospital for acute, it is not the hospital that the Valley community needs, which is also made of all the other parts, because honestly, unless we think that from now on only acute patients exist, everything else must be, unless we delegate to private clinics, I believe that she has seen, for example, a broadcast of a few days ago on the very worrying of this Theme, but surely we will talk about it in the next advice, but, from this point of view, I ask her if, in her opinion, what she told us is an answer today, because the chronological terms, for example, compared to this project, after your answer I have not understood them, that is, it has given us times? He told us: ""The Aosta Valley community in 2030 will have the piece of the acute""? And I repeat: the piece of the acute, not the hospital, does not seem to me that she told us and, when we have the maternal childish put there, when we have psychiatry, what will those parking lots be? Of all this she has absolutely not given an answer and I repeat: none of us asks to have designs or things to disseminate outside, but we ask there is clarity, because she knows it better than me than having a radiology or two radiologies certainly has an impact not only for what concerns the operators that you tell us every day that they are not available, every time this thing is said, so we even split the radiologies. Radiologies, we will also need, I imagine, of machinery both on the one hand and on the other, that it does not seem to me to be also of little importance compared to the costs that we must imagine. Reading that resolution - however, as I say, I did not read it carefully because only today it was downloaded -, the same general manager, Dr. Uberti, at the same time clarifies his main interest in the solution of the residual interferences that may arise between the construction site in viale Geneva and west of this compared to the operation of the current hospital. The contents of a technical examination report that contains different points that, according to him, require in -depth analysis: for example, most likely, in an audition we will ask for access to the documents but having this relationship can certainly be of great interest, because the concerns of Dr. Uberti are concerns that we have reported from the first day and I am pleased that she continues to remember that the turning point has been in that 2021, because we are absolutely convened. Choice made in 2021 the more we go on, the more the right one is. Maybe in his replica he can also announce to the Aosta Valley when the piece of the hospital for acute is expected, in the motion there was also talk of having the knowledge of chronological terms not only of money, so we know, and we have read it everywhere, that we speak of 178 million for that piece, now we ask them: then it also tells us the chronological terms in which this piece will be done and I repeat: a piece, because then everything is missing. Thank you, of course we keep the motion and we will listen carefully to the other colleagues."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Barmasse,Roberto Alessandro,1959.0,M,UV,10,4841,"I intervene from a technical-administrative procedural point of view, obviously the commissioner has already expressed himself. I only express my opinion, now the councilor Guichardaz at the beginning of his first intervention he always spoke saying: ""But we will not have a unique garrison"". I think the garrison will be unique, because there will be the hospital for Acuti and the part that remains in phases 4 and 5 will be the maternal childhood department and psychiatry. Once the project is completed in its completeness and complexity, we will have a single garrison. This is obviously good, but the other statement that she has made, councilor, is: ""All the health workers ask for the single garrison"", I worked many years in the hospital and nobody has ever asked me for anything. Perhaps Covid, however, has taught us, in the sense that it is to hit all the services in a single place - I repeat that I express a personal opinion - can perhaps create sometimes problems and perhaps a little something from Covid we should have learned it. There has also been talk of a double radiology, I think that a double radiology - I don't know if it is still expected - but it would certainly be very useful because we could separate the services for the degents and services for exteriors, this certainly could bring advantages from the point of view not to cross two paths that could create problems for patients. Which does not mean to have the same machinery in two radiology services with very high costs, but perhaps of the services and equipment that is a little more basic using staff according to needs. The hospital for acute for me is the hospital, because in the future ... but already now we should not include hospitals where patients remain hospitalized of the months, so much so that the hospital for acute, that I would not even call it for acute, but I would say the hospital, it is related - and this is also taken up in the plan for health and social well -being - to all health services in the area. So when the whole system is in operation, the hospital for acute will be a hospital in which people will have to stay as little time as possible, because we know very well that there are a whole series of hospitalization pathologies for which patients who do not need an intensive service is right that they are not in a hospital structure, but are in intermediate assistance facilities and maybe these structures is good for the territory for the discourse before On the fact of having a hospital in the city I think that each of us has its own opinions and they are all right and correct, there is no scientific publication in the world that say a hospital where it must be made inside a city or outside, these are subjective choices in relation to the needs also linked to logistics, the conformation of the territory, to the available spaces, to the occupation of green, therefore the methods and problems are multiple. I think it's difficult to say: ""I am 100% right and someone else is wrong"". There were some choices, as I said before, I know very well that she, councilor Guichardaz, does not approve of them, this said it several times, we would miss more, but to say that someone is right and someone is wrong I think it is very difficult. This government has made a choice, he is carrying out it, on one thing I perfectly agree with you, the hospital unit is an urgency and on this I would say that the health personnel is what he asks us, at least these are the questions that are asked to me, in the sense that people want them to leave the work for a hospital because they can no longer see this eternal excavation in front of the hospital that we have been thinking there for 15 years. Another little thing I wanted to say to the director Lucianaz, whom I saw that he has already booked again, is that she has reported a whole series of data and I congratulate her because she complains that she has no information, but she also manages to know the size of the parking lots. Before criticizing the absence of storage structures of materials or drugs, to have too small parking spaces where we should see how we can park cars, maybe first we acquire information, after which we will do the necessary criticisms. I think that the spaces also for further services in the old Parini structure are large spaces, where we can imagine a whole series of services to support Valley health and support to the hospital, this is my idea, but I think it should always be talked about perhaps with numbers and not only with assumptions. And if she managed to also have the size of the parking lots, tell me how she did, because I don't know."

Meanwhile there was someone who said a motion or an agenda is not denied to anyone, especially when this goes to a postponement in the commission, because it is in the commission that the real issues come out, they can be debated, they can be deepened. Of course, perhaps the demanding of the motion could be smooth, probably with a minimum of amendment we could say: ""Yes, Okay, we will go to the commission and we will do the insights"", which inevitably everyone asks, because I read just yesterday a commission report when there was the hearing of the SIV and the contract had to start in 2024, but in February, so there is evidently a delay and these delays will inevitably they will continue. Phase 3 has finally closed, also here with a significant delay, which is certainly attributable to what has been found, to the archaeological excavations, to all that has occurred and will have to start the 4 and 5 phases that complete the entire context of the hospital, from the hospital for acute to the hospital where there is the maternal childish and where there will be psychiatry. Here, however, we need to give time, we need to give answers, we asked in the past as a political force and also as a united center-right, we had strongly asked to understand times and resources that were necessary to complete the phases 4 and 5 Another reflection on the question of the single garrison: yes, they asked the commission, the medical unions asked here, they came here to say: ""We want the single garrison"". I remember that when I was councilor and I had tried to move the clinics by decentralizing them from the hospital, there was a popular uprising of the doctors: ""No, everything must be concentrated there"". So the things are like that. I believe that a minimum of amendment on this verification on technical-planning compatibility, which now no longer has reason to exist according to our point of view, but there is a need to have a general picture of the investments that will be necessary to get to the conclusion ... colleagues, please ..."

This asks for the opposition and this asks for the Valle d'Aosta community, because it is so, in every area, in every context, in every public apparition that we do these are the fundamental questions that are asked to us. Councilor, President, reviewing the demanding, we go to the commission and do the right insights, that it seems to me that it is something of a normality of a regional council that wants to go in the direction of building the future."

It is worrying the way you deal with this topic, your goodness, we will talk about it the next few months, above all the many Aosta Valley will talk about it that will be called to vote soon, even those of Aosta, common, and this will become a topic of sure public interest, as it has always been, but I would never have imagined such draconian answers on your part. Your goodness, continue like this. The delays are, I repeat, the executive project was from 2013 and the engineer Felli had planned to deliver the hospital for 2019. This is the story and look at what point we are. We will continue with this eternal construction site, with the disservices that many Aosta Valley know and above all those who work inside. To his colleague Barmasse I say: yes, the data, unfortunately I did not hear a single data in the councilor's response. I asked 27 questions, I also asked the 178 million what they were referring to, she rightly Glissa, continues like this, is her style, does not give answers, not only to the opposition, does not give answers to the Valley community. It is his way of behaving, he spoke for over ten minutes without giving a single answer to all the questions we asked them today. On the fact that in the old structure of Parini there are large spaces I ask the colleague Barmasse to accompany me, let's go to make a visit to understand what the large spaces are inside Parini, I only see that there are great critical issues. You don't want to talk about it anymore, on November 4th it seems that it is this definitive date, a pitcher date, for you it will be an important date, it will be the beginning of many big concerns for the Temo regional administration. He has not given us answers, he does not give us satisfaction, he does not want to talk about it, you talk about it to the newspapers and then we will have to do the job that an opposition advice does. It is a very little edifying way of dealing with the problem."

What I ask is to have answers and to have them in the commission, where we can confront each other. The same intervention of the former councilor Barmasse allows me to raise some of the critical issues that I have already reported in the introduction, the fact that even those who are mostly knows how to be structured, that is, the fact of having two radiologies or having one, however it affects the organizational model. We have just approved, and the commissioner Marzi, a corporate act, said it is normal - but we have also been told in the commission - that also compared to what the structure will be, to what human resources must be, to what the choice of the machinery will also be to be ... they will certainly be choices that somehow ... and we know it well because any building is designed and thought also with respect to the organizational model we want and compared to the services we want to give, This moment we do not know how many beds of the hospital for acute there are ... then I share, of course long -term care are a problem, but she also knows the data of the Valle d'Aosta healthcare, and knows how well how the patients are stopped within that hospital. We cannot say: when we do the hospital for acute, this will no longer exist, because then then you sincerely do it as soon as possible, because it means that they will not exist longer, it cannot be from this point of view. And also with respect to the definition of the spaces, there is ample literature that tells us how a modern hospital must be made, which must be within areas in some way not frequented by traffic, but this is quite evident, just pass there at six in the evening and ask yourself the problem of how ambulances - but we see it every time we pass - they must do to get to that hospital. Also from this point of view, if we want to inform us, there is ample literature that also tells us where hospitals must be put. What emerged also from today's debate, and surely the demanding is overcome, but sincerely we keep it anyway, since it seems to me that the will is so much that of not coming absolutely to the commission, whatever the demanding is not this will ... the questions we ask here, what underlined Dr. Uberti within that report attached to the resolution are all questions that naturally should be answered, at least within this classroom, at least we should be able to know. After that the choice is made, you carry it forward, because you are the majority and therefore you carry it forward, and I say it for this, but I think it has also been seen, for example, on other projects, which it absolutely did not agree, but, when the design started, of course it is not that one starts making battles or putting himself on the barricades, after which it will be time to tell us if the choice was right. Also on this, I will pass them, colleague Barmasse, because she was rightly not in the commission ... but, when the representatives of the doctors came, the only request was the unique garrison. This is the request they did to us, so this is what I feel like telling you because there is a document that has been filed in the documents of the Commission. Then rightly she says: ""When all the buildings will be done, this will happen"", who knows, I believe that neither I, nor my children we will see that unique garrison, but also on the times we sincerely have not yet understood even the times of the piece of the expansion, let alone if we were to ask for the times of everything else. From this point of view, I believe that today's debate also shows that somehow in the commission you have to compare yourself, and how!"

Well, the usual positions have always emerged, but there is some ideas and it is right that we take note of it and we also express our belief. We have always been convinced - and even more today with the times that are increasingly lengthening - of the fact that building a hospital there or, better, expanding it, making that place the fundamental center of the Valle d'Aosta health is a stupidism, it is madness. Some who plan hospitals and then, with little satisfaction, I must say, because it is never a satisfaction, to understand that those who governs you are doing nonsense, we have also recently read in an article in the local press, in the sense that a nice article has been made on a gentleman who is the engineer and designs hospitals, who is Aosta Valley. Of course, since Nemo propheta at home, as they say, went to design abroad and then designed the city of health in Piedmont. The journalist asks him: ""But how do modern hospitals do?"", ""Eh, modern hospitals are made where there is green, where there is space, where there is the possibility of making a modular hospital"", perfect, exactly the opposite of what we are doing. Beautiful, it was truly a great satisfaction, I say it with naturally irony, because we really understood that what we said, simply taking advantage of our common sense, was perfectly spot on. Making the hospital there, at the intersection of the two main streets of the Aosta Valley, that is Mont Blanc and the Gran San Bernardo, is gigantic nonsense, but by now you have decided, there has been nothing to do. The colleague Barmasse referred to Covid, who clearly did not teach us anything, because that was the project and that remained despite Covid and instead had the opportunity to make a different choice precisely using the motivation of the Covid and you did not do it, so it is clear that the will is that, who knows why I have my idea, but I do not express it here, but it has nothing to do with the functionality, with the functionality, with the use. Real reasons why Valley health should be designed in the future. I also hear about two radiologies, instead of one, thanks again that we can keep one open at this moment and I don't know how much, so we really say that everything that has been said and reiterated does not clearly make the two sides, but here on healthcare you should not do issues of political colors, you really have to do only common sense issues and to think that the health of the Aosta Valley is the priority, in my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, according to my convictions, education, but you really made the wrong choice. I therefore believe that even, let's say, the assessor inconside are out of place, those ad maiora, etc. I actually respond with another way of saying that the Latins had: that bad tempora currunt and then very often we forget the other piece, sed peiora Parantur. These are bad times, but, if we go on this way to govern like this, they prepare for it worse."

Functional hospital of the areas of hospitalization, notes on emergency management in the emergency area, first aid, intensive care, where, among other things, a double radiology was highlighted -one for the emergency room and one for everything as the body for acute -, the hospital headquarters of the first level DEA, the reception -certified -accepting functions, the emergency room functions in emergency and urgency regime, the therapy functions. Intensive, the functions of diagnostic radiology in urgency, notes on the characteristic functional types of the operating rooms, areas for the preoperative preparation, areas for the preparation of the intervention team, operating rooms area awakening, elipport surface, its characteristics of employment, Hospital Street and section of the Internato Parini Parking Park execution. This document of 31 pages - of course, connects Baccega, I am not saying it to her, I am saying it in favor of speech - it analyzed in a precise and precise way, as far as we are concerned and also as regards the SIV, the Department and the Usl company, the phase concerning the object of the resolution of Monday 4 April, so, regarding the fact that the government has absolutely shared the choices - and has done it in a preventive way, important to recall -, certainly during the year that will come there will be a whole series of aspects on which we will find ourselves confronting each other on this important passage that ended on November 4, 2024 and that it will now provide that the President of the Region decrees and that then, with the beginning of 2025, we go to the race. The object of the dispute is linked to a single aspect, on which, however, during the various debates and the various questions that have arrived on the executive of the new hospital, there is a vulnus, that is, the fact that from 10 April we then had the control of the external verifiers on 5 July 2024, a date referred to in my intervention during the general discussion of today, but also referred to during some of the initiatives that in the meantime came from validated by the RUP on July 8, 2024. This postponement from 10 April to July 2024, which then led SIV to approve to the board of directors on October 15, and therefore we to go to the council on November 4, is the only thing that moves from a temporal point of view the documentation that was distributed to all the colleagues of the councilors in April of this year. In my previous report, and this also I say it again for his colleague Lucianaz, the cost of the works, net of VAT and charges, which in this presentation was almost 140 million euros in this presentation, is also highlighted. The fact that afterwards went to 143 with VAT and the charges causes the 178 million of the resolution of 4 November 2024. In fact, everything that this initiative, which is absolutely out of the times - and, I repeat, nor because of the presenter, nor because of the undersigned -, in all respects, provided for in his demanding is not only now late compared to the fact that the junta has already approved the variant of the executive design. In the council, but also with respect to the fact that the whole part that is asked to share had already been shared in a preventive phase that at this point is about seven months earlier than the first leg of the executive design variant subject to this motion."

I remember that when I saw the first project hypothesis, I was in the city council in Aosta, he had arrived there with a huge papyrus and there was already that will to go in that direction. I hope I don't have the podestà tone that you have every now and then, but I know her, so I know she is like this, those who do not know her well in some way can also be annoyed. What I want to say is that we had a report by Dr. Galotto in the commission, who has explicitly explicit a series of paths in a fairly clear way I have to say and those paths must be re -explored in our opinion, because Dr. Galotto now I think it went in retirement and had an assignment precisely in the logic of following the works and the path of construction of the hospital for acute and also the phases 4 and 5 I believe, I do not remember the resolution that was adopted. Here is the need to have a comparison in the Commission, where it is easier to work, it is easier to learn more, it is easier to also ask questions that can also be only technicians for those who are not in that sector. We will therefore certainly vote for the measure because we believe that it is a duty, beyond this commitment which is a little too articulated, go to the commission and make a further study on the path that the new Parini hospital for Acuti in Aosta will create."

You spoke of the 31 -page document, I present 1: the one on the numbers of the hospital complex, there is a page to put this. Yes, of course, it is a page, and several times we have been told in the commission: ""No, but that ..."", ""the beds ... Ah, but you can find it in that schemino"". Yes, we are told how many beds there are, we are not told compared to the analysis made, we are not told anything, but it is absolutely good. ""If we don't want to deepen the themes, we rightly don't do it."" We have other tools, so do not worry, councilor, that the questions that we would have asked them in commission from here on we will do it in interpellations about interpellations, this is what we can do, therefore access to the documents and constantly interpellating to be able to understand better where you are going, because, I repeat, you are going to you. I hope you are not going against a wall, not so much for what concerns your choices, but precisely for the Aosta Valley population. Councilor, I really invite you to listen to what emerged in a short interview of a pensioner a few days ago on La7, because we will talk about that and it is certainly something that we have been denouncing for some time within this regional council that worries us very much, because then it is precisely the fragile people like that pensioner who must contact private health and even to contract the price of a simple intervention, therefore most likely also on this theme, They took place in the Aosta Valley and the Aosta Valley was recognized, because, from the point of view of health, in some way we had the same treatment both for those who were in one condition and for all the others. Unfortunately, what we are recording is no longer this and we are recording that for some time there have been the most fragile people who have difficulty having answers with respect to treatments that are not of who knows what relevance, but that of course they make a person's quality of life can change."

I do not enter the discussion, perhaps we did it three years ago by supporting the accompaniment of this path. I do it very short: I think the final data of the discussion can be summarized in five very fast points. The fact that in a few months the expansion of the new hospital will compete, the fact that in a few weeks the president of the Region will approve the decree, the decree will sign ... it is from the day before yesterday that the regional government has positively evaluated the project and is a few weeks ago that the SIV assembly has spent at the assembly what is the executive, colleague, and that a few weeks ago the RUP validated the whole. To return to the initial reasoning, the verification of the external subjects was made in July 2024 and the document that was illustrated for several hours in the commission is practically the same that was approved by the regional council two days ago. This is to say that it seems to me that the commissioner has highlighted not only the path, but the mandatory technical passages that have been made in these 5-6 months and that the novelty of today is that the government has positively evaluated the project and that in the coming weeks there will be the decree to go in the coming months. I think we are not all technicians, we are not all engineers, we are not doctors, we have another role, I think that the synthesis of the debate ...

Here to my right we have the world champions of the referendum and it seems to me that there has been a consultation that had a very close, very important debate and I think the answer was quite clear. The answer was given by the community that has widely deserted a consultation, among other things, many of those who went to vote have also somehow expressed an opinion contrary to the will of the proposers of the referendum. Now a whole series of initiatives, I say it, I don't know if I interpret badly, but they are basically to delay and block the works, and then say: ""See, here you don't go on"", that is, a whole series of initiatives are initiatives, in my opinion, pretext: that's why I believe that the exhortation that comes from these benches to the government is to proceed, it is to let the technicians speak, envy towards some colleague who seems to me to have skills that are above average, they are engineers, they are architects, they are security experts, so it would seem that the designers, the technicians who have been identified are at least of the unwary, of unreliable people, while here in the regional council we have excellent minds. So, since I try to stay with the things that a person of common sense highlights, the commissioner Marzi and the government is urged to proceed as they are doing, in a tight way to be able to give as soon as possible a new hospital to the Aosta Valley, because, if we are feeling this committee of the No, we continue to have chress, because we do not know where the new hospital wants to be done, it is not known with what money, but you are not known, Then go on with common sense, correctly and try to proceed with the work."

I make a small importance on the things I heard, it has been said that the Valle d'Aosta population expressed itself back in 2007 or, better, that it did not express itself because it did not go to vote. I believe that all those who are here, maybe the youngest no, but the others surely yes, they will remember that that was the referendum of the ""broken pencils"", I think you will remember it; It was made, by the main party that at that moment was at levels other than the current ones in the Aosta Valley, a campaign was made to ask the people not to go to vote: Pas de sens pas de vote. The people who went to the polls instead responded clearly, in a clear way, and here there are also people who sit on the government counter and who had dedicated a lot of energy to that referendum, then in the meantime they have changed their mind and this is another story, but I would like to point out that from 2007 they have passed 17 years and in the middle there has been everything and more. The health situation has been extremely changed, there are problems that are linked to a request for better health care, and they are no small things, there has been a pandemic that should have requested, it should have caused reflections, it should have asked for a moment and to make comparative evaluations, because, if you remember well, when we have chosen not to follow the path of the Parini hospital to be redone, we have really asked myself if it is really easy to ask. Forget things, it is better, or if there is a collective memory deficit ...! Because we asked that a comparison was made to understand which choice, given that since then, everything has happened to come to 2021, that comparison that could tell us: ""It is better to use the money in that way, it is better to make a hospital outside, it is better to leave it there"", that comparison did not want to do it, we didn't want to! Because we did not say, when we voted against that famous resolution that led to the resignation of both - because it was logical that, if such a thing was not supported, it was out of a majority, it seems obvious to me ... - We did not say: ""No, let's do the new hospital"". No, gentlemen, we didn't say that, we said another thing, and it is not a waste of time to deepen, especially after everything that happened. Please, therefore, we leave the 2007 referendum in peace, because you know very well who was the responsibility for the failure of that referendum and I believe that, if after 17 years another thing had done, we would have had surprises, because the people in the meantime perhaps also matured and what happened has left in all people - and they are all that they need health interventions - perhaps different from those who were previously there. You did not want to do the comparative study, you decided to go on, this is the road, but, please, you cannot say that asking to do an in -depth analysis, an audition with all the documentation that is requested in the appropriate commission of this advice is a way to slow down the operations. But what slowing down? You ask to see what is there, you ask to take stock, but are we kidding? What do you want to slow down? We ask to see, then we know the positions that our positions are different, and I speak of our positions, mine and of the colleague Guichardaz - they were very clear from the beginning, we have not walked on and we did not vote first in one way and then in the other. That was and that's, but allow you to ask to be able to see the documents."

Personally, as regards me, if there is a referendum, even if a person goes to vote, that is, he decides, rightly, because he is the only one who takes charge of a civic duty and, if it votes like this, the others will have to suffer the decision. We remember, by memory of everyone, who voted for about 30% that referendum and this 30% abundantly above 60, I went to see it: 63.56% had said that the new hospital wanted, so somewhere else, just for correctness. Having said that, now things are done, it went like this, but I wanted to replicate because the reply is always the same, it would be time to end it with this question, because probably, nobody will have the counter -proof, if the Abdostani had gone to vote, they would have asked for a new hospital, but okay, this if anything it shows that at the time, I hope less today, the absolute majority party of the era had a great ability to influence The electorate is good for him clearly.

Just last week, the dossier on immigration to Valle d'Aosta was presented, a document that highlights very significant data on the presence of migrants in our region and their difficulties of access to basic services. The dossier also underlines how essential it is to guarantee this effective integration and structured support to avoid marginalization and vulnerability between migrant people. In light also of these data, it is clear how important it is to reactivate the service that is the subject of this motion, because this counter has the task of offering assistance and orientation to those who live in already precarious conditions, it becomes an indispensable tool for promoting social cohesion and facilitating a real inclusion. Also in the Defr, the importance of the inclusion of the inclusion was outlined in the strategic objectives and priorities of intervention, but we return to the path of this motion, which originates on November 2, 2023, then there was a new initiative in May 2024, precisely to understand from the government what was happening with respect to this service and had been declared that precisely in the budget 600 thousand euros had been allocated with a provision of 200 thousand euros and the service would have been the service. Reactivated shortly thanks to regional resources to give continuity. We understand that this continuity is not there, therefore in the motion we ask that the commissioner clarifies the times and intentions with respect to the activation of this race, assuming that perhaps we have not seen it and instead has already been published. We ask the commissioner again to have answers because that continuity, taking into account that the service has been interrupted since December 2023, I would say that it was not there."

To meet the needs of colleagues also expressed with respect to the timing, I will say some short things by announceing that the Lega Group will vote contrary to this motion and will not vote contrary to the question of the hearing in the commission, which, as we know, is the cigarette of a condemned to death: it never refuses, nobody refuses, so it is not a big commitment. What our opposition finds in general is precisely the principle and the spirit that unfortunately this service has and is something that we have also reiterated on several occasions, because this service that we want to support and finance with flower of public money is a counter that offers services that are actually already there and there are for everyone, that is, today the services that this counter provides, should provide today are already provided to all Valley citizens who go to any type of shop. Specifically, the ""Live Valle d'Aosta"" service is offered the orientation and accompaniment service to territorial services and support for social and residential insertion. There are already social branches, there are already a series of services that are evidently provided for all citizens and, precisely because there are a series of appeals and actions, I remember one above all the association financed by our friend Soros, the ASGI Association, which obviously takes care of only defending the rights of immigrants, at any foot, every time there is a public call, a law or something, if there is something that also excludes someone who has landed tomorrow and Those who in this region or in its municipality has been born and lived there for a lifetime, then the Asgi intervenes to ask for equality of rights, but the equality of rights that is asked on one side you do not want to get on the other, because here you want a specific desk that supports only immigrants for accompanying, territorial services and support for social housing insertion. Not only that, consultancy and orientation in school, with support for enrollment, where necessary, training and work, support for the compilation of telematic practices relating to citizenship requests. I mean ... but there are the offices that already do it, if I go to the Municipality counter, if I go to the police station counter, if I go to any type of counter that today is available to everyone, I find the same service. We are not sincerely understood why we should activate and finance a service specifically and exclusively only for immigrants. Obviously, compared to this spirit, honestly we do not find ourselves sharing the need to build, structure and implement this service, therefore evidently we will vote contrary."

We are therefore working with a wider vision, aimed at connoting the new immigration desk with a more solid structure and with more activities than in the past, in order to finally guarantee a continuous and qualified presence of the service in the area. In addition to the realization, among other things, of this counter, the offices worked on three family projects - that is, fund, asylum, migration and integration -, deposited between 23 and 24, which represent an added value and specialized in the commitment aimed at improving the access and quality of services. Fami projects focus on three crucial areas: the strengthening of the teaching of the language to facilitate linguistic integration, which is a project already started; The development of an advanced data management system through a computerized database, which allows those who access the services to obtain personalized and targeted support, which is a project during the start and the strengthening of training courses and recognition ..."

The ambitious goal, to which all these interventions contribute, is to create an immigration counter that does not limit its functions to a mere point of assistance, but can represent a real model of inclusion and innovation capable of responding complete and professionally to the needs of new arrivals and residents. To this end, the competent structure has been working since last month of March in identifying a strategic and suitable space that it can be allocated to the counter. The goal is to find an adequate location that can respond to needs as a point of reference for citizenship. In this sense, the offices are examining several options of spaces to be found both in the public and in the private individual, but to date they are not easily viable. The offices are therefore continuing to explore other possible solutions, taking into account that the search for an adequate venue for this destination is not easy, as they are characterized by processes that require complex assessments and procedures not of immediate solution. For this reason, given that the goal therefore remains to continue working to find a solution that in 2025 allows the opening of the counter by identifying the solution to outsource the service completion, it is a solution that ensures the finding of the location as a future complete outsourcing implies that the manager, in addition to taking the service, identifies the seat of the same at the same time. The tender specifications, among other things, in this sense, is being completed in such a way as to start the service at the beginning of 2025. With the outsourcing of the service, we have therefore imagined a new model that guarantees efficiency, accessibility and continuity, entrusting the management to a specialized economic operator. This choice will allow us to build a structured, welcoming and proactive service, capable of dealing with current challenges in a timely and professional way, through a more agile and flexible service unlike the past in which the limited resources reduced its effectiveness. The selected manager will also have the task of providing complete and personalized assistance to anyone who turns to the counter, therefore dealing not only to orient the new residents and migrants in bureaucratic issues, but also to promote the integration and knowledge of the territory, facilitating their insertion in the Valle d'Aosta community. This means support in housing research, assistance in understanding and charms of administrative practices, as well as a working orientation by territorial, social and health services. Ultimately, this choice to outsource not only accelerates the opening of the service, but enhances its effectiveness, transforming ""living in Valle d'Aosta"" into the most functional immigration desk as a model that will bring tangible benefits to the whole community. What is just expressed therefore makes it evident that the demanding of this motion is overcome in facts and concepts and, for this reason, we ask for the withdrawal or we will abstain."

I state that this morning, about the debated question on the hospital, the commissioner Marzi had the opportunity to affirm that they, as a government, do not proceed random, as they say today, a little so attempted, and that they are consistent in their action. I fear, councilor, today, that I will have to deny it with the documents in the hand of this topic, of the management of the kennel and cattle; A question that we had already raised in unsuspected times, because it was spring and asked for news, through an interpellation, of the government's will to face the question of the management of the kennel and cattle, knowing that at the end of this year the existing convention would have expired with an animal rights association, the one currently in place. Well, the answer was not given to us by the commissioner, who at the time for health problems unfortunately was not present, but by President Testalin, who told us that the offices were evaluating what to do. Then, in the summer, we understood what was the result of this assessment on what to do, because the regional council, with resolution 952 of 12 August 2024, which bears as the title ""approval of the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the regional administration for the three-year period 2024-2026, approved with DGR 276/2024, with the management of the kennel and regional cat"" will, of what was the technical-administrative, but also political, to go. Then we had other initiatives, precisely after the summer, after this resolution of the Council, in which we were explicitly explicit that it had been decided to no longer entrust this service to animal rights associations, but to proceed with a tender, pursuant to the contract code, and then this fact was further explicit. Of course, this motion has started which has been postponed several times, as we know, for various reasons, and then also in the Defr it was explicit by the government, this will to proceed not with direct assignment as it had been done previously, but through a race, was explicit. The answer in this regard, which also came from the commissioner, was that of the fact that ""it must be done so"", ""is better like this"", ""is more transparent"", the concept of rotation is, etc. In reality it is not so at all. This is not the case, as we will try to show you, the documents in hand, today. And even a great contradiction in the action of the current government emerges. Then, the assignment of the management service of the kennel and regional cattle is expiring precisely at 31 December of this year. There is a government press release that announced the intention to proceed with tender pursuant to the Code of Public Contracts for the assignment of this service for the future three years, that is 2025-2027, and precisely, given the resolution 952 that I have just mentioned, with which we proceed to the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the regional administration for the three-year period 2024-2026 with an allocation, Euro, therefore they are not even negligible sums, and considering that this motivation, this resolution, had already objected to this fact a little, hot, at the time of the last intervention of the ... I think it was September, let's say that this deliberates at a certain point like this, as ugly, as they say today, says: ""Considering that the competent offices of the prevention structure, public health, veterinary and food safety have been, for the next three -year period, service in question pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/23, i.e. the contract code; CONSIDERED - He continues - therefore necessary for the reasons represented above ... "". Here, there are no reasons, that is, having evaluated it does not mean that it is a motivation, in terms of administrative law, it is a classic non -existent motivation or, if we want, sometimes some judge calls it apparent. There is a fake motivation, because you cannot tell me that you have evaluated and therefore you do this; you have to say what you have assessed. Relevant if we put this resolution and another resolution of this same government in a watermark, that of 6 December 2021, where instead the agreement between the Region and the Association that currently manages was approved; Also because this resolution tells us many things: he tells us, first of all, for example, that clearly the rule foresees it, but we call it back so much by memory of everyone, that is, we recall ourselves, as they say, but also because I think many of you will not be very interested in this topic, but the management service, in fact, of kennels and cats can be entrusted to zoophilic, animal rights and protectionist bodies and associations; Moreover, we will see later, even the rules or circulars of the Ministry, primarily, say ... there is the law, precisely the 281 that says it, then says this, I am quoting the passages of this resolution of this same government of 2021: ""Considering that pursuant to article 24, paragraph four, of the regional law 30/07/2010 - our law on animals of affection - the activity carried out in the context of the conventions. of the expenses actually incurred for the non -health management of the kennel "", therefore by non -sanitary aspect only reimbursement of expenses eh, because there is a health part, a non -health part in the management of these bodies, of these kennels and cats. ""Therefore considered - he continues, cuts some parts - on the basis of these considerations, that the management of the kennel and cattle - attention, this is the key step, one of the key passages - by the regional administration should not be entrusted to be taken into account only of the costs, but also of the well -being of the animals, included not only their living conditions in the structures that host them, but all the various activities aimed at their assignment and related control, respect"". Here, this is the fundamental aspect, because the laws that govern this matter, all the administrative measures that govern these subjects, are marked not to a simple matter of costs, of evaluations, as is done to sell goods or entrust services, is not this; Animals of affection are something else, they are animals, in fact, and must be treated differently from any product. And then he still says this resolution, always a very interesting part: ""Recalized the circular of the Ministry of Health, which on May 14, 2005, number 5, of implementation of Law 281 of 91 - precisely the national one on the animals of affection - which provides that the conventions for the management of kennels and cats must be granted priority to associations or entities having the protection of animals"". And then he continues, I explain it again, still acknowledging a question that is important for the purpose of our discussion, of our discussion, that is, it says again, this resolution, an equally sacrosanct thing: ""Taking note that, pursuant to article 8, paragraph 7, of the regional law 16/2005 - that on voluntary associations except - voluntary organizations cannot participate in the public evidence procedure relating to the assignment of public contracts, supplies "". Here, then, here we close the circle: on the one hand the rules on the matter tell us that when we deal with this matter we must not only look at the appearance and the income statement and, therefore, things that can clearly be identified in a contract, it becomes difficult to identify in a contract as well as you love animals, this is a little difficult, I believe, that you can codify. So, here, putting together all these pieces, we come to the fact that we absolutely consider: that by choosing this path to make a race, evidently we necessarily exclude voluntary associations, which instead are the ones that have been dealt with by it, and very well I would say, also because (and here another contradiction arises) then that resolution, which we have mentioned 2021, what does it still say about those who are still managing? In the spirit of giving continuity to the management, pursuing the priority objectives of protecting animal welfare and spread of the correct human-animal relationship, he reported the need to review some points of the current convention. ""Considering that the Valdôtaine Association etc. etc. managed the regional kennel and cattle from the eighty -nine to today, thus gaining a considerable experience in this area; given that the competent veterinary public health hygiene structure has analyzed the positive trend of the management of the kennel and regional cattle entrusted to the A.VA.A Onlus etc., in the last two years of management from which the average number of animals is highlighted, adoptions of the specimens returned to the owners "". So this is the non -health part, and there is the whole table with the numbers: how many animals entered, how many animals have been entrusted, to those who found a place, given by adoption, etc. saying ""Ah, these have done well, they are doing well"". Now we wonder why the government has completely changed its way without saying why. Here the critical issues were born, because if you don't tell me why two years ago everything went very well, it was managed well, the service had to be marked by issues that are not only economic, technical, etc., but precisely to what are the correct principles, I would say, that they are more than shared, that is, to treat animals well, to love animals, to also do the activity that is further and not paid, obviously, to try to place the animals. they need, the puppies etc., who need to find a family; Now, however, you move on to a commercial criterion, you make the race and why do you make the race? Do you think there is some companies, some s.r.l. Or any cooperative, perhaps, that can do better? Not of volunteers, however, eh, of people who do it to earn, more or less, or maybe even to undergo those who then make work. This is a problem, so there is something that doesn't work. There are various problems in this decision, there are technical-administrative, legal problems, because we have seen that, in doing so, we go against principles that are still sanctioned by the norm, that of offering the priority to animalistic associations and, moreover, I open a parenthesis, we have also been confirmed by the councilor in his latest intervention of the month of September, which told us that there was only one, now there are three; They are three better, there is more competition, there will be the possibility to choose who to entrust it to, right? Even ... if by chance they say all three are not there, then we will have to choose another way, but in reality the norm also says that the management of kennels and cats should be directed, that is, made by the municipalities; Here we do it at the regional level, but from the municipalities, therefore by the public body and alternatively, therefore, then in the second instance, entrust to other subjects, primarily to voluntary associations. Here we are instead at the third solution: we make a tender as if it were any service, as if it were to build the dog's kennel, it is not this ... the kennel and cattle is not that, it is something else than much more important and much more fully. So this is the technical-legal aspect, then there is that of the merit: in fact, we have seen and I have listed you now what the contradiction is, on the one hand in saying two years ago okay, it is well managed like this, there is the healthcare part, but there is the non-health part that it exists and which, among other things, provides for the refund only of the costs and, now, without telling me why, you change, you change the way, here. And then there is clearly a political evaluation. Because this choice is evidently a political choice, of the two each, I believe I regarding this political topic: o, dear councilor, you are making you bring someone else to the arms - it is inevitable to think this, since you have not motivated - or, I don't know, someone has already thought of some cooperative; I don't know this, but you understand that it comes to think badly when there are many elements put together. Many clues make a test and therefore this scares me a lot. We therefore believe that, despite what you have said and written, despite what you have also sanctioned on the Defr, perhaps it would be very appropriate to redo a reflection on this decision - which I think completely inappropriate - to proceed with a tender instead of referring, as always, to those who have done well; That I do not say that they are the ones who are already there now, anyone else, but an association of animal rights activists who do it with a vision, with purposes other than those purely profit. Then, the motion (I read the demanding, then reserving naturally to intervene in the continuation): ""The regional council commits the regional government to revoke, also in self -protection, the decision to proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023 to reach identification - I say in self -protection because in my opinion it is also illegitimate from an administrative point of view, however - to reach the identification of the regional, excluding voluntary organizations from the possibility of becoming a foster of this management; proceed with the identification of the subject to whom to entrust the management of the regional kennel and cattle, in compliance with the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Minister of Health on May 4, 2000, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 and only in the alternative, in the absence of voluntary associations concerned, proceeding pursuant to the legislative decree 36/2023 "". Clear, it is evident, if you do not want to do it then directly, if those who were prioritously questioned ""to us"" does not care "", then you should act directly, if you do not want to do it directly, you should then resort to anchor; But that should be, as I said before, the last residual choice: first the volunteers."

It is obliged to refrain on this initiative, above all because, as already highlighted, compared to a situation that today sees at least three animalistic associations on the regional territory, and no longer a single association, as referred to in the 2021 resolution that she recalls, and therefore it must be considered, in addition to the fact that there are three animalistic associations, also the significant economic entity of remuneration of the service, equal to 1.5 million euros, 500,000 euros per year, widely higher, this figure, compared to the direct assignment thresholds to the services today determined in 140,000 euros, but this knows this better than me. Instead, it is not understood why and how the rumor for which the volunteer associations cannot participate in the tender, as recalled; In reality, the same can participate, as required by article 100 of decree 36 of 2023, which provides for this possibility for subjects who have already had experiences, with a positive outcome, with public or private entities, as well as voluntary associations are also. We therefore confirm what has already been reported on the intention of this administration to call a European tender, with an open procedure for a single lot for the assignment of the management of the kennel and regional cattle; Also because this is the only way that can be traveled for an administration that wants to survive and do the correct thing for the community on this issue. The procedure will therefore be carried out by virtue of the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, naturally pursuant to the contract code, therefore assessed on the basis of the best quality/price ratio, compared to the cost proposed for the management of the service, which will surely examine the proven previous experience in the management of public kennels and cats. In open procedures, voluntary associations are also considered economic operators, authorized by the system to provide services and carry out economic activities; Therefore, the same are part of the list of subjects to whom public contracts can be entrusted, as provided for in European law. In line with the aim of guaranteeing the highest quality of the service, the regional administration will not proceed with the award if no offer is convenient or suitable for the service subject to the contract, in the full interest of the well -being of dogs and cats hosted within the kennel and regional catile. It should also be noted that the priority criterion foreseen by the circular of the Ministry of Health she recalled will certainly be respected in the tender notice; This criterion, if the management is entrusted to a subject different by an animal rights association that is not able to guarantee animals with its own internal resources an appropriate physical and socialization activity, as required by current regulations, establishes, in the guarantee principle, the entry within the kennels to animalist associations. This comparison perhaps also allows us to explain that the European standard exceeds national law, allowing everyone to participate in public tenders; It therefore also exceeds the regional law 16 of 2005 (discipline of volunteering and associations of social promotion) which, in article 8, provides that organizations cannot participate in public evidence procedures relating to the assignments of public contracts of works, services and supply. National legislation, especially the European one of contracts, has in fact legislated differently; It is possible that the associations involved have taken this regional law as the only reference, thus feeling excluded, but so it is and never wanted to be. Instead, what has always wanted to do is distinguish the role of manager of a space and public money from the role of voluntary organization, to protect the service rendered, the animals involved and also of the organizations, in fact, animal rights activists. Connect Sammaritani, of course I also said that we will ask to withdraw the initiative otherwise we will abstain; In my opinion, it is absolutely important to grasp a distinction on this issue, because, in addition to administrative aspects, which are used to deal with the theme, behind all this there are more than legitimate but purely motivations of a political nature; Those who are involved pro tempore in the management of this department, but also in the task of having to interact with the subjects who manage it, is perfectly aware that behind this world there is a world that, as if to say, moves, grinned, looking for contacts, confirmations, which at the moment should be absolutely serene. So we, as a government, not only do we represent the fact that the choice that was made with acts is correct, is a transparent choice and is the only one possible, because you understand well that there are absolutely legitimate reasons that led to the then act of 2021. Motivations that have been fundamentally incardinated on the presence in this region of a single voluntary association: choice more than legitimate; To date, this is no longer allowed. Among other things, a figure of this kind does not need a poor fassacchiotto, chubby and peeled like myself, to represent it to a lawyer; It is also linked then after the figure that in all respects, how to say, someone ... can I make a car body shaming? I heard, it's called self -irony in Italian. However, objectively speaking, this thing here also allows you to do an intervention on the figure, because the figure is an important thing, as well as in the presence of multiple animalistic associations. The fact then after that it was decided with a resolution to give a mandate to the unique control unit of client to insert the performance of this tender within the services was also represented by the CUC as the absolutely more normal way. As already represented by a group colleague of his yesterday, it is not of this government to give indications beyond one's autonomy and autonomy of others, and therefore, consequently, it is not even of this government to ensure that someone harpsings ours."

Returning to the topic, I must say that there are gaps in the reasoning that she, or in any case for her, did, because actually we have never been told what had to be the prerequisite. That is, we say: this is the right path, we do not say why the other is wrong, the one you have pursued until two years ago is wrong and that it would no longer be prosecuted, because in fact it is still persecutable, so it is an essentially political choice, evidently. This, okay, is there, it is you in the government, you can do what you believe in this profile, but the contradiction of the arguments - or rather, of the arguments on the one hand and nothing on the other - that emerges precisely ICTU Oculi, that is, immediately. From there there is a speech: let's do this because there are these constraints, there is the possibility of entrusting directly, there are these possibilities, they did well ... Then, as I say, I have nothing to do with this association and it is not said that it should be her, but I speak of the associations in general because they are straight from principles other than those of trade or purely economic ones. All these reasons on one side and on the other the nothing. Then, in putting all the reasons and nothing on the scale, it understands that it is strange to understand why and why to accept this obvious contradiction. This is the true theme. The figure is important now, it was even before, because it is not that we are the result from that, as more cosine in this commitment of these sums (we said 500 thousand per year), but even before we were more or less there, therefore over 400 thousand abundant, so it is not even the motivation. The problem is that you are trying to support, with non -existent motivations, a purely political choice. So that you say it, that you say that volunteers associations ... that then we hope that they go to do it what they have to do, because that's the problem: you are burning, because now you will give it to a society or a cooperative that does things because it has a certain return, because the most economically advantageous offer is that, and then hoped, as it is already written also in the rules, that the volunteers have already made that part, And they go to do clearly free, etc. Who knows if they go to do it? What if they don't go to do it? I mean, these of the cooperatives or this s.r.l. (let's call it s.r.l.), who goes there because he is paid to do certain things, do you think he slams day and night to look for a house for a cat? But when ever? But where do you live? But what have you seen? This is the theme, so you are burning yourself. A sector that is already delicate, a kennel and cattle that already as structures is not worthy of a reality like ours, which, however, all in all, is limited and should have much more decent spaces for these poor animals and much more suitable, because I do not know who went to see, but I would invite you to go and take a look at where they are kept, with so much love I must say from those who work there, but certainly with the same tools. I repeat, the concept is here you must not go and watch the tenders, these purely cheap considerations should not be made: animals are not a product, I have already said, they are not a service, they are much more. Their management requires an appearance that cannot be quantified, you cannot put yourself to the table, you cannot reduce to a tender where you say ""you have to do this, this and this and everything you do Vale Tot and I give you"" because it is not so, that's why the rules are oriented in that way. There will be a reason: either the legislator is one who does not think or has made them for one reason and the reason is that. Therefore, to conclude, without making too much the sentimental, but these topics interest me because I keep the animals and therefore annoy me when someone bureaucratizes this sector too and it should not be so, it should not be healthy, let alone the animals that they can not even defend themselves. Gandhi said so, that the civilization of a people is measured by the way in which animals treats. Here, if this is, you are probably not very civil."

To date it is not so. Among other things, I have been calling on this, because she is an auditor, as well as a technician and a professional, in all the answers I have given; I recalled it directly because I was absolutely certain that she had caught this aspect, I am absolutely certain that she also caught it by reading the resolution of 2021, just as we took it at the time and we took it in the continuation. I also add the fact that, in full legitimacy, we not only keep to the well -being of animals, including dogs and cats, especially dogs hospitalized in the kennel and regional cats, because as you know, the cats in all respects are of the mayor: we had a dedicated meeting in this sense to Celva on which we renewed the documentation on the Celva website itself and we had a moment of strong sharing with the offices compared to the future and present. Fact, of municipal relevance, therefore it is also useful that in this sense it can be correctly represented that the hospitalization of the poor cats at the kennels is not allowed by the law for the well -being of the animals themselves. We keep both dogs and cats, and in this sense the sensitivity that she recalls is absolutely married. I add, however, that it might seem a paradox not only political but above all administrative, the fact that on a tender with multiple subjects, which could win it for figures to the extent of 500 thousand euros per year, you are asking a government or any administrator not to make a public evidence tender, but I know that this is absolutely not in its intent."

Speaking of the presence of more than an association, I believe that this can only enrich the landscape, in the sense that it is true that an administrator says: of course, I have only one, so I work my hands, to that do (if he wants it) and ends there, but this is not the problem I think that outside the Aosta Valley, where I have to imagine that there has never been a single volunteer association, the kennels of others are also managed by volunteers. parts, so much so that there is an appeal to the TAR, of which I had read a sentence long ago, where there was talk of this: an association that had challenged because the entity, the Municipality in this case, since it was municipal, had decided to put together various municipalities, to consort with other municipalities, and manage it directly. There the association said: ""Eh no, you have to give it to us because it is written 'priority'"". It was not evidently corrected, so much so that the TAR rejected that appeal, but it makes us understand that the voluntary associations are also outside, they manage the kennels and cats and clearly they are not only one for metropolitan areas, perhaps Lombard or Piedmontese; Here in Valle d'Aosta there was this situation. There are three of them, I told you before, call them all three, if all three will tell us no, you will do what you want to do; If, on the other hand, one tells us so, the dates to that and otherwise they will decide, maybe they will also consort among them, what is the problem? The problem is precisely the merit of the question. Volunteering is a plus in this case, for this reason it is necessary to favor them. It is not a favoritism of any kind, it is precisely to do good for animals. Allow that these services - which are partially economical, economically quantifiable, etc., and in part instead arise from love for animals, which cannot be replaced with any payment - can be coordinated. This is the theme and this is the vision that it should have, in my opinion, a politician in this sector. Then you have differently, patience. Of course, we do not withdraw the motion."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8794,"This motion follows an inspection initiative that we had discussed some advice ago and which highlights a problem that we then spoke later, that is, the question of the increases. A question of the increases regarding public residential housing which, substantially, stems from a modification and a different assessment that has been calculated by the ominous, therefore an improvement of what is the structure, of the neighborhood, of the residential area in which some housing of the public republic building are inserted, which has started a series of increases that have been considered unjustified and also to a problem relating to the issue of the heating, ARER did a part of it, also doing also psychological terrorism, saying that the fuel was about to run out and therefore it was necessary to save it. Net of this, the theme of this motion is precisely the question of the rent and I will try to summarize it in a few lines. What is the question? The question arises from this: if we take a payment method ... let's talk about the free market, on the free market anyone can contact the home owner and ask: ""How much do you want to rent?"" And the home owner says to you: ""I want x"". If it is fine to me and I have the substances necessary to be able to pay well, if I don't have them, obviously I refuse. In the public residential construction sector, however, it works in a different way, because I ask a question, I enter the ranking, based on what is a series of calculations, the figure I have to pay is developed and, once I am inside, if this figure is increased to me I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of not being able to cope with you. Trivially, I have already done this example other times, but I think it is particularly evocative: if I am a person with disabilities, who takes an accompanying pension of about 380 euros per month and what you want can happen, the eternal father can also come down but I always 380 euros per month I receive, I will not be able to pay a rent of 390 euros, but not even 381, because I enter 380. Considering that I don't eat, he doesn't drink, he doesn't move, don't breathe, don't watch television, don't warm me up and so on, it is clear that I can't pay more than 380 euros. Today, however, unfortunately many public residential housing are actually subjected to this ""blackmail"", because it happens that the people who live there are increasing the rent, you can see the expenses increase. I have made examples, I always have another of the many bills that have arrived, of € 909.90 for a popular house (one month of rent, only for rent, are 909 euros). It is clear that if I have an income that clearly cannot change, if I am an elderly person, but also only if I have a job that does not allow me to earn figures of this type, it is clear that I will not be able to cope with you. So what is the means that has been used by other regions to prevent this cost from coming? Because the problem is that we have a regional law that rightly has one of his article, which is 42, which governs the forfeiture of the assignment. The forfeiture of the assignment is indicated - one returns in the case of the forfeiture - when there are no four bills, therefore four unpaid rents. After four unpaid rents, the eviction procedure begins. It is clear that if I have a rent to pay for 381 euros and I receive 380, as I said before, making it account that I do not eat, it did not drink and do not do anything else but I limit myself to living and breathing, if I have a rent to pay 381 euros I will not be able to pay it, so what happens? It happens that, although not having the possibility, not the will, the possibility, I open my portfolio and 381 euros are not there, there are 380, so I can't pay the rent. It will happen that I will obviously accumulate a debt, which arrived at the fourth bill, fifth bill, sixth bill - sometimes there is a tolerance, this must be said -, a dear letter will arrive saying: ""my dear, or you return to this expense or otherwise you go outside here"". The person in question clearly tackles an impossible, improbing challenge, also in this period in which accommodation in the private individual is not found. So how did they organize from other parts, in other regions? I made the example of Piedmont: Piedmont did a very simple thing, most of the regions actually did it; Piedmont has established a series of bands (bands that we also have, however, we have of the bands), but these bands determine precisely the payment that I will have to make; So, depending on my ISEE and depending on the state of the accommodation, I will have to be inserted in the corresponding band and then pay a figure. Here, however, in the part of Piedmont, a different thing is made and, in my opinion, interesting and intelligent: it is said that there is a series of bands, there are 19 bands. The first is the support band: a fee is established, so -called due fee, so you need 100 euros per month of rent, but you are in band 1, and probably band 1 is dedicated to people who perhaps have an ISEE equal to 0, probably (and if I have an ISEE equal to 0, it is easy to think that I do not have the substances to pay anything), so you will have to 35% of the fee due. If you have such a low ISEE, you will have to pay 35% of the fee due. Imagine to say that the fee due is 100 euros and therefore you want to pay 35? There is no maximum fee compared to income for this first band, but there is a fee and precisely Piedmont says to you: ""You will have to pay at least 40 euros per month"". This is for the poorest band. Then, gradually you go up and as you climb with the income, you also go up with the bands. There is the protection band, from n. 2 to n. 8; There is the stability band, from 9 to 13; There is the safety band, from 14 to 18, there is the stay band. What do these bands establish? Establish a maximum limit of fee compared to my income. For example, we take the band n. 8, which is a protective range: it tells you that you have to pay 75% of the fee due, so if the fee due is 100 euros, you have to pay 75 euros. But the maximum fee compared to my income is that it will not be able to exceed 16% of my overall income, so if I have an ISEE of a thousand euros per year, I will not be able to pay more than 16% of that ISEE, but because objectively if I take off the funds for that type of expenditure, I then have no more to live, so there is a limit that is imposed on my income. Do you earn a thousand euros? You cannot pay for rent more than 16% of your income and so to climb. There is, for example, the last band, which is that of stay, which provides for 240% payment compared to the fee due (I guess the stay band is for income certainly probably higher than 20 thousand euros, perhaps to 30 thousand, I don't know) and the maximum fee is 20% compared to my income, with a minimum fee of 300 euros per month. So, there is a table that also allows me to know, transparently, how much I will have to pay and that allows you to safeguard my income, because - and I repeat what I said before - if I am asked more than what I have I will not be able to pay and we will find ourselves having people who are evicted and then with the social services that must deal with the evicted people who have been evicted by the Region itself. So we have a person who is thrown out of the house, who then goes from social policies and says: ""Eh, but I am homeless"", ""How did it happen?"", ""Eh, you threw me out through the arer"". It is a vicious circle that objectively is absurd. If I do not have the substances to be able to afford a rent, I must be able to have the guarantee that it is a popular house, which does not turn to a market, which is not a system to earn, but a social protection system for the weakest people; It is clear that this system must make sure that I am protected. This is why, with this motion, coming precisely to the request we have presented, and we have talked about it several times in this classroom, the colleagues also advanced the revision of the revision of the regional law 3/2013 and was announced, by the councilor, that a work in this sense is being done, the regional government is committed to introducing, when this revision, a method of calculation that provides for a maximum roof to the fee, compared to income, in order to limit the increases. discriminated against and encourage a containment of the costs for fragile assignees."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,11987,"As I have noticed, I connect Manfrin, so far I have absolutely not made merit to any initiative treated so far, as far as I am concerned. This instead allows you to make an analysis, but it is an analysis that also connects to the demanding part. How he can see ... I know that then she will keep the initiative, but when I have tried to represent them what is the object of the dispute, she will notice that, at the end of the fair, let's do well not to vote for her and explain why. First of all, his initiative starts from an assumption, which is rightly that of the Piedmont Region, to say the whole of it. By comparing the calculation systems of Valle d'Aosta and Piedmont, the overall set of the two systems must be taken into consideration, and not just some elements; In fact, in the Piedmontese system, the nuclei that reach an ISEE value equal to the double of the access limit to the ERP, must release the accommodation. Therefore, the beneficiaries are people who find themselves in conditions of effective economic fragility and therefore, consequently, limit the fee to a maximum of 20% of the income has an incidence only on the nuclei that are placed in the lower income bands, given that the higher income nuclei must release the ERP housing. This is regarding Piedmont. Conversely, in the Aosta Valley legislation, there is no limit of ISEE beyond which the accommodation must be issued; So, if we wanted to apply the same meter measuring of Piedmont, some Aosta Valley families could have to pay lease fees abundantly beyond those you have brought as a comparison meter. In fact, it should be remembered that our legislation does not regulate a maximum ISEE value for the purpose of a possible release of the accommodation in case of achievement of economic stability, so, in technical terms, the fact of not having the permanence criteria that allow, as in other Italian regions, the release of the accommodation, but also of not having criteria for permanence defined. You know that one of the things that are evaluating themselves in the table that will involve us I think by the end of this month, because the President of the Commission, in his attention to the theme, gave me the dates in which to convene to face a first synthesis of the research work that the University of Valle d'Aosta is carrying out to arrive to define the new law 3, therefore as a consequence on that occasion I believe that we will have the opportunity to face some aspects that you all know. Basically, however, to make a slightly more technical analysis, you know that, to make it short, there are access assessments, the criteria for accessing public residential construction and then there are criteria for staying. On the access criteria - we have already said it thanks to some initiatives that Baccega colleague did -, what is making itself evident, unlike other initiatives that we are dealing with in this classroom, is that in reality the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta is not a large sleeve region for access to public residential construction. 3 is not a law that, in fact, went to treat in a socially adequate way to the times - and this is why we are changing it - access to public residential construction. First of all because the 3 thought in terms of ISE and not ISEE; Secondly, because, thinking in terms of ISE and not ISEE, it also kept outside the residential construction public a range of population with perhaps some types of difficulties, so the work that this advice is soliciting and that we are in place of variation of the 3 could give positive advantages for the Valle d'Aosta community. The fact of having an ISEE at 8,500 euros - because this is the reference parameter, for example - could ensure that with an ISEE of 30 thousand euros for a nucleus of six people, in fact we would speak of 9,375 euros and we today with an ISEE at 8,500 we keep it out; Not to mention a whole series of aspects that have to do, for example, with disabilities and another series of issues that we will perhaps deal with very short. Coming instead to the permanence criterion, we believe that at this moment we are the only one, or one of the very few Italian regions, which applies to those who access the residential construction public a life access, therefore, basically, when the nucleus accesses the public residential construction remains inside the house - leaving the mobility, because otherwise we complicate too much things -, however, we hypothesize that a nucleus of four people, with the adequate house. of public residential building, or vulgarly called the popular house, we assume that four enter and there are four of them for all their lives, in fact they would have the opportunity to remain within that house all their lives; Therefore, consequently, even the canons, to get to calculate the lease fees, would be fees susceptible to the square meters, the age of the accommodation and the OMI parameters which, at this moment, in that area of ​​the city, are increasing, as we have already had the opportunity to represent for its initiative. The OMI parameters obviously do not choose the autonomous region Valle d'Aosta, but take into account what the market for areas of the city is; Therefore, if the OMI parameters in the area where the public housing in the city of Aosta are growing in the majority are growing, it is because, in fact, it means that, in terms of purchases and sale, there is a market in that area of ​​the city. This is. But the object of the dispute is that if we have - probably the only region of Italy - still a law that allows a nucleus to enter Erp, therefore in the popular house, and to stay there for a lifetime, even to be able to somehow also leave to future generations, you understand well that we, in fact, are accompanying the whole life of this family during its social and economic emancipation. It is possible that a family unit that enters public residential construction in 1980, with a single parent who works and with two young children, then, during the life of the nucleus itself, arrives to have two parents who work or perhaps the reference parent who grows from a professional point of view, the children who grow up, the needs that change, they can even become income recipients, in fact all this part is not collected by the experience within the popular house, stay inside this popular house. Well, if we in some way represented - but this I say it only for correctness of reasoning - the demanding of its initiative, we could even get to bring this nucleus, for a series of motivations that are obviously not the reason why it wants it, to pay even more than what it represents today, for the simple reason that in all regions of northern Italy there would be criteria for which, once you enter the ERP. Indeed, there are public residential contracts with variable duration which, in fact, are renewed and I imagine that they are renewed by evaluating the permanence criteria within the public residential construction. There are also after the other criteria, which in other regions are applied, including the Piedmont Region, which even tell you clear and round, obviously not from today, but through the exit paths from public housing, that when you arrive in emanciparts as a family unit, you from the ERP you have to go out. Consequently, when you say to a nucleus (we remain to the Piedmont region), which has emancipated and has come to become a ""socially richer"" nucleus, you also say that it comes out of public housing. So then, in the list of the calculation that you represented as an example of this initiative, that nucleus is not there, while in the Aosta Valley there is. Since I know that she is very attentive to the theme and that she also knows him well, not only do I agree with her with respect to the fact that all the theme of the innocent arrears has basically a social name, so much so that in recent weeks we have made meetings where we have also involved colleague Sapinet, obviously only for the part of his own that it is not social but the structural one, but, in fact, we also wrote to the ARER, Social service upstream of any choice that has to deal with the stay in the accommodation. And this thing will be increasingly strengthened in the new 3; Not surprisingly, it is since 2023 that we allocate funds in this sense and that with the next stability law we are trying to make it - sorry for the game of words - stable. However, the object of the dispute is precisely the fact that if one were to think about the whole multidisciplinary reinterpretation of this blessed 3 ... ... what does multidisciplinary mean? It means that the access criteria in terms must probably be adapted, passing from the ISEE to the ISEE, this ISEE must then include a series of parameters, naturally secondary, which are those of the implementing resolutions, which probably must be paid to a company other than the one that was there in 2013, that is, 11 years ago, including the Aosta Valley one. When you enter the public residential construction, you should not stay there for life, but there must be parameters for which you have to be accompanied to get out of public residential construction and therefore, consequently, it opens the whole other front that we often deal with in this classroom, which is that of: are the public housing available to this territory enough? How is the management of the number of public housing and all the social tools related to the socio-habitative distress compared to our territory, compared to the fact that our territory is a complex territory and respect, for example, to the PTP of colleague Sapinet which, in theory, does not require a use of zero soil or to decrease certain things? For which this is the multidisciplinarity to which we will have to meet when we reason Erp, but this is also the reason why if we go to take - and I do not say that she did it, let's understand - only a part for example of the choices made by a region close to us, we then risk after making even greater damage than what we are doing today, because in a region that, like ours, does not provide for our own Emancipa is accompanied towards the private market, purchase, lease or other, but remain in public residential construction, if we go to apply the criterion provided in the demanding part of this motion, we actually find ourselves in the condition of going to pay even more to those who have emancipated today. Which I also find correct, let's understand each other well, but he understands that then after I happen to be called to respond to initiatives where he tells me: ""It costs too much"", but probably it costs too much also because in some cases, because in my opinion we could also get to make simulations compared to other laws, we would discover, if we ever do it, that, depending on the region that we examine, there would be nuclei that would already not be part of the public. For this reason, I also tried to speak in the arm, because she appreciates; In fact, I try not to speak to the arm normally, simply because, as you can see, I spoke 13 minutes, instead the times are minor and therefore, consequently, in this way I also try to self-send to the classroom a little less than my face and my voice."

So don't worry about his face, of which we will not do body shaming and we are against any work in this sense; She does and takes responsibility for it with the Prime Minister. But in reality we are pleased and I am pleased above all because she expresses a political thought that instead the reading of cold leaflets does not express. But she, councilor, said a series of things that brought in one direction, now then, closing the speech, said things that tend to be opposed and different. I start by order, so at least we understand each other. I fully agree with her, with the fact that our region does not have a system of exit from public residential construction and I am happy that she, in the conclusion of her intervention, said that this is not right, also because I was obviously afraid that she said: ""No, but we must keep everyone and therefore we cannot put a legislation or a device that contains rents like the one we propose to do"". I am happy that you did it, because it is evident that we have the data in the hand of what are the ISE and ISEE of the people who are in the public residential housing and if you, as I imagine, will have taken a look at them, will discover that in the public residential housing there are people who have an ISEE at 140 thousand euros. Now, it will understand that, personally, if I met the person who with 140 thousand euros of Isee keeps accommodation, a popular house that should be destined for fragile people, for himself, a certain indignation I would manifest him, saying: ""But sorry, but with the income you have, but you cannot be able to look for a housing from another part and leave the house to a poor unknown?"". Since he nods and agrees, then the idea should be what evidently must be put on a limit, exactly as the other regions have done. So if we only introduce a limit of income, we could free a part of those accommodations that are now occupied by people who can pay for, have the necessary substance, to pay for a rent and are not at risk of not having a roof over the head. However, this reasoning, on which you agree, drops all the reasoning that you have done for which this initiative cannot be accepted, because we are not that we say, with this motion, that in the revision of 3/2013 we must do only and only this intervention; We say that, with a view to reviewing Law 3/2013, inserting a reasoning and a method of calculating this type is necessary, because if in the review there should be the provision of a clause for which, after having exceeded a certain income threshold, I leave the accommodation, it is obvious that a table and a mechanism of this type would allow us to guarantee that the rent does not exceed certain levels. If she focuses all the speech to say no to this initiative, with the fact that we have not, however, councilor for this thing, she uses an argumentative fallacy that is objectively very weak. I say and I go back to repeat: if we want to give equity in the assignment, in the management, in maintenance, in the payment of public residential housing, in the list of the discussion of 3/2013, the reasoning to put income limits beyond which people do not have to pay because they do not do it, because they cannot, not because they do not want, is essential. All this goes perfectly and quietly with the two issues that raised: 1) the fact that, having exceeded a certain income threshold, I have to leave the popular house; 2) the fact that the public housing have become hereditary, which is deeply wrong. They can be transmitted to cohabitants if these actually respect certain low income fees, on this they are perfectly agreed, but this is how it works in other parts, so it is clear that our system and our need for revision of the law must go in this direction. However, councilor, net of this and in the face of what I have just said, do not welcome this initiative is wrong, for the simple reason that or she says to me: ""No, look, in the motion, if you want to make proposals, she must insert all of her revision of 3/2013"" and if she wants, I do it, and I also do it for free, without having to commission some university professors who have no more to do in life of charity in favor of photographers and perhaps every now and then some service candidates. In favor of these, if you want, free of charge, I do it as a consultant, available, completely available, without even taking pictures, I come and willingly take them as a consultant. If, on the other hand, the idea is what we have to invent something to reject the initiative, because the initiative actually has its own meaning and value (and she recognized it), but I don't know exactly how to reject it, then I am sorry, she knows that we clarify several times. I think that everyone, net of those who are the tones or net of what are the ideas, sometimes coinciding, sometimes conflicting, recognizes each other an ability and a value, both political and expression, we cannot however say, however, sincerely 1) that the tones used are wrong, 2) that the proposals are not acceptable, because she also recognized it. There are no real reasons for which this motion cannot be accepted. The motivation cannot be: ""Eh, no, but we have a system"", also because, and I will tell them more, if this initiative, and what you said testify to it, was accepted and a calculation method was introduced, which I have highlighted, which acts as a multiplier if the income is superior, as income grows, the increase in the monthly foil for those who have a higher income. Mechanism that disincentive the maintenance of the accommodation of public residential construction. Because if I arrive to take an ISEE of 140 thousand euros a year and I have to multiply the fee due, I only did the example of the nineteenth, that is, the stay, but if we want to calculate it up to such a high ISEE, the minimum multiplier I don't know what it will be, 1000%, 2000% of the fee due to the basic fee, and when a person who has 140 thousand euros of ISEE will find himself paying 3, 4 thousand euros per month of rent. You will do two calculations and will say: ""Maybe it is better that the accommodation releases it and I find one at a private level"". Councilor, in our opinion it is not a political point, it is not a matter of leaving a testimony, it is not a trivial question of communicating one's idea; In our opinion, this initiative, objectively, has its own value and none of the reasons that you have communicated has the value or the possibility of saying that this cannot be implemented. Obviously we will keep the initiative."

These are four years of debate on public residential construction, four years in which little or nothing has been done; More nothing than little. There is this process of law 3 that we have been waiting for for years. We hope that the law arrives as soon as possible, because there are many issues that are at stake: the leases, the arrears, the resolutions of the contracts, the issue of the housing emergency, the concept of adequate accommodation, the methods of assignment, the choice of accommodation ... are all themes that must be addressed. But above all, probably, the regional announcement must also be questioned, because there is an interpretation of this regional announcement, so where there is an accommodation available in Pont-Saint-Martin, or vice versa, in Valpelline, is assigned to the ranking and it is said to it: ""You are from Pont-Saint-Martin? We assign you the accommodation to Valpelline"". It happened, it's not that I'm inventing things about, and if you don't accept it, get out of the ranking. But you can't do this! We must be serious and the arer absolutely applies this method. We clearly know that this law is not adequate, we await it and the demanding of the motion that was presented by the colleagues of the League also goes in the direction of making a more serious reasoning also than the lease: at this point, introducing the maximum text will be important and absolutely mandatory, also because there are no housing, there are none decent accommodation. It is true that a whole series of works are ongoing, but before two or three years we do not see them, despite the promises that have been made several times in the commission ""will be ready, they will be ready, they will be"" but in reality at the time of ready we have seen very few. Accommodation are assigned which are impossible and often rejected, most of the time they are rejected, and this is an element that must be taken into consideration. We will therefore vote with conviction this motion, believing that this commitment must also be taken into consideration in the new formulation of the law, and we will be careful in this sense; And above all, hoping that this law is questioned as soon as possible, precisely to show what are the real and concrete problems that public residential construction over the years - because obviously things have changed in the last decade - has manifested."

And certainly also on our part there will be attention, because it is a topic that everyone is close to us, that these rents do not go to very high levels. There will also be attention from us to check that this is a calmieri thing and that it goes well and is correct for everyone. Therefore the commissioner said that he will surely bring the modification of this law and we are willing to refrain on this motion."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,12,5337,"I realize that when we speak 12 minutes ... and I am not naturally telling her, colleague Manfrin, who of course must find motivations for which to maintain the motion; Because the motion is a political commitment, and therefore, as a result, it is also good that there are abstention and votes in favor. Everything goes well, however what I have represented a little above is what we are already doing, in the sense that the indications that have been given, and that among other things, regardless of what we would have given, are collecting in the study phase for the reinterpretation of law 3, are those I have represented in the introduction, that is, I have clearly explicit the fact that to date our law 3 is highlighting: 1) entry requirements not adequate to those For a company like the Aosta Valley today, that is, with an ISE, not with an ISEE, at 8,500 euros in fact we are going to identify a band of our society which is not the only one that we should involve to have a popular house. There are other bands, which are bands in difficulty, but perhaps not in absolute poverty, which should, with the use of the ISEE not of the ise, be involved in the future law 3. 2) the next reinterpretation of law 3 will have requirements that will provide for the fact that a core that emancipates, therefore a nucleus that improves its situation, no longer is entitled to remain in a popular house. When this will be possible, at that point it will also be possible to predict what is made evident by its initiative. So the motion cannot be voted, but, in political line, we absolutely agree with what you are representing and that will be identified at the level of law 3, because, to date, what are the requirements that provide that a family unit that is good is already outside the ERP, in fact it is not taken into consideration. 3) the fact that in all respects everything must be managed upstream by social policies and therefore, consequently, the fact that everything that has to do with public residential construction must be placed under the hat of the socio-habitative distress; Therefore, consequently, even everything that is decided over a nucleus must be inserted within a whole series of initiatives which, in fact, have to do with the attention that the social policies department is already making available to the reference nucleus. 4) When this type of choices will have to be made, as mentioned also by colleague Baccega, probably at that point it will also be necessary to take note of the fact that there is a need to have another series of tools to be joined to public residential construction with respect to the theme of socio-habitative discomfort. Certainly to date, the support for lease is one of the tools available to the vast world of socio-habitative discomfort that is working in this region, we should probably also tend to make a whole series of assessments compared to the social emancipation of a nucleus that has been in a popular house for a long time, but everything, including the numbers I have given you, is a photograph of what the 3 was not taking into consideration. If all this I am telling you, it is because, in fact, everything this is absolutely in the course of work. Then I understand how much colleague Baccega says; Obviously I cannot agree with him with respect to the fact that, in the course of these three and a half-four or five years, political choices have not been made on public residential construction, but this is part of the different roles that we have in the Council at this moment. However, what I say is that, regardless of the assessments that the Manfrin colleague every time he nicely represents compared to his vision of those who are also collaborating on this thing, in the specific case, leaving people alone, and instead coming to the research studies, what we can absolutely represent is that these studies are of the end of 2023-early 2024, so if we are very able to arrive with the month of November, which has already taken into consideration, Numbers with a series of possible solutions, given that then after the research study that was commissioned to the University of Valle d'Aosta also provides for a synthesis of a proposal of a new 3, probably, without giving reason to those who say that we have done nothing, because it is not true, in all respects we would absolutely have already given very strong addresses because the 3 is admitted to the Valle d'Aosta society of 2024, 2025,2026, 2027, 2028, except. All that I am representing, of course, is a prospect of administrative temporal time for different roles, which sees the solutions in the same way, that is, we all agree that the 3, as it works today, cannot work in the future and therefore probably the one that will become the new 3 will also have the possibility of exiting or the invitation to exit from the public residential construction of the nuclei that have emancipated and therefore also has the possibility of applying this. Motion today provides."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,5316,"Councilor, sees, this is one of the few times, I must confess to him, that I see her particularly in difficulty in defending a choice that she makes, a choice of classroom, of course. I see it in difficulty because she usually has a motivation, shareable or not, and, on the basis of this motivation, seeks, in a different way, with various modulations on the theme, to convince the interlocutor, or at least who listens. Instead, she is already the third different motivation that addresses for the failure to accept this motion. Then, she said in the order: that this motion cannot be accepted because there is no rule that provides for the exit from public housing; Then he said that the acceptance of the insertion of what we ask within the revision of the 3/2013 would lead to an increase in the fees that would lead to the removal of people, that is, exactly the objective that we then put in inserting in the 3/2013, the people who obviously improve their economic condition. Then now he told us, councilor, that what we ask for already doing it, that it is more or less what perhaps said Marco's colleague. So, see, councilor ... interruption out of the microphone no, I have no idea what you share in the majority, but perfect ... I have no idea what you share: I listened to the declaration of vote of the colleague of Marco and therefore, based on that, I intervene, if I am allowed. What is the question? The question is very simple: that this is a system that works, that is, I put a limit of income beyond which I cannot pay, so I have an income X, I can pay for the maximum Y, not more, because otherwise I don't have the money. That the system can be inserted with a view to the revision: we do not write in the commitment that must be included now, we ask that it will be inserted with a view to the revision. If you say that there must be a tool first to bring out the people who have improved their condition, it is clear that the two must be done together. Then, when you are inserting a way for which people who have improved their economic condition must exit, is compatible with the approval of this motion which asks exactly in that method of concord, that method of processing with respect to the new law, to also insert a new calculation mode. So that you are already doing him, councilor, it's not a motivation, but she did not say it in her intervention, she said a different thing. Regardless of this, now you have evoked another question, that is, the question of the study. I am sorry, I do not want to talk about people, net of the things that make us smile, make everyone smile in here, because the world is small and the Aosta Valley even more, but the thing that I sudden me, I wonder: ""But what is the competence of the people who are elaborating these studies?"" Why is this the problem, do you understand? Because of the people who are elaborating these studies, I would really like to know what competence they have to tell us what it must be done. What competence do they have? Why if the competence is to be university professors who teach a subject that has nothing to do with public residential construction, I am sorry, but unfortunately there is no competence, there is not, and being part of associations or foundations is not a requirement that makes you compatible with the assignment, understand? If a person who does not have the skills tells me what I have to do with a regional law, I objectively and honestly I cannot accept that evaluation, regardless of who it is; But if we take the curriculum, and we have seen the curriculum, we know that the skills are not there; And this is a concern, because then the effects of that elaborate law will be discharged, exactly as it happened with the 3/2013, on the innocent roommates, because perhaps tomorrow to administer there will always be someone who believes that he is a condominium administrator and must simply harass the people to ask them for the rent, instead of understanding social difficulties. So what he has just said is welcome, that is, the fact that public residential construction must be managed in concert with social policies. It is correct, it is the correct approach, I perfectly agree, it is one of the few sensible things we have heard in this discussion. Welcome. However, the fact that all this is given as a motivation in order not to accept the motion, sincerely, councilor, has nothing to do with it, it is not an impediment, on the contrary, the two can go hand in hand: the exit from the ERP as well as the fixation of an income limit. Did he want to give a motivation? Councilor, he did not succeed. If you want, do not vote for the motion, it seems to me that things are clear, but this will evidently remain a stain compared to a debate that, in my opinion, instead should be a participatory and perhaps shared debate, because a law of this type will regulate, as she rightly said, the public residential construction of the future and we talk about the fate of thousands of fragile people who, if they were faced with the wrong choice, will pay dearly."

In reality, my first intervention had been short precisely because we are waiting to see that holy document that will be called Law 3, which we have requested for years, has been 4 years, and if my statement of the first was what has been done little or nothing, there are then the data, there is colleague Charrian who is good and says: ""The public administration speaks for acts and the public administration speaks for results"". The results are there for all to see: there is a ranking of over 600 people waiting for the popular house, a series of evictions have been made in the rather significant years, there are people who sleep in the car, the fees are not adequate, they are fees that are obviously to be reviewed, the condominium expenses, for those families who are strongly in economic difficulty, are exorbitant because they have been obliged to be enchanted in Telcha. The innocent arrears are a arrears that has been financed but, in reality, it spends little because they are all families that have not had the lowering of income as those defaulted nuclei somehow are either retirees or people who are unemployed, this is the actual data. These are the data that allow me to say that in recent years little has been done, or little or nothing. In the years that she knows, we have been together, probably some passages will remember it, every year we assigned 120-130 accommodation to the ranking, there was mobility, and there were no resources that are now there. We had had the resources that are now there, we would have gone to wedding, because we would have gone to do a much more profitable job, probably the fifth lot would have been done before, etc. These are therefore the statements, we really hope for that document to compare ourselves, to make reflections, the assessments on the new bill that we hope can give the Valle d'Aosta community of the concrete answers and update these data that I have placed them."

In fact, just to make our goal understand, which was successful following all the collaborations that have been there, our demanding provided for a protocol shared with other regions concerned, with competent departments of the Ministry of Health, agriculture, food sovereignty and forests, aimed at allowing interregional handling. We had been more specific here on a specific category of animals, which are the calves, which is the one that, in the current moment of the births that there are calves in the Aosta Valley farms, needs to be able to transfer these animals to the farms that are more qualified and are more equipped for weaning and for their breeding. I read news of a national newspaper and report the title that makes it clear: ""Blue Tongue: free movement authorized, northern Italy from handling"", this makes it clear the collaboration that has been there. I also want to clarify that the Aosta Valley, in this case, has been the lead to ensure that all this happened and from November 1st this was successful.

I had also communicated that Active had requested the authorizations of the case from the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of the Environment, believing that it was not necessary to start a specific environmental impact assessment procedure. Compared to this - I would have given information in response to the question already registered in point no. 36, but we anticipate it -, on 30 October Active communicated to the Piedmont Region and to us that the General Directorate of Environmental Evaluations of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Safety instead considered that the Company must present an application for verification of subjection to environmental impact assessment, pursuant to Legislative Decree 152/2006, the Consolidated Law on the environment; Decision, however, which was taken by the competent Ministry and communicated to the company, beyond the terms provided for by the standard, as well as a press release itself. ATIVA, in the relationships that have also entertained with the help of colleague Bertschy and directly with the top management of the company, in highlighting how this determination could evidently involve a further elongation of the scheduled timing, necessary for the realization of the provisional derivation, consequently frustrating the objective (i.e. the realization of the same within the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel), which would have been preparatory to guarantee us a regularity of a regularity of a regularity of Transit, he also informed us informally in the morning that compared to this situation he will descend with his CEO in Rome tomorrow to reiterate his position at the deputies and to support the bypass proposal which, however, had already obtained a favorable opinion from the Ministry of Transport.

We are talking about children of 10,12,13.14 years, who are being treated in the structure of child neuropsychiatry; Guys with very serious pathologies, also syndromes, for example the Asperger syndrome, whose families have seen themselves, at some point, in the dark about everything and learned almost by chance that in the list of activities that had been proposed to them, that is, proposals to children without involving parents, there was a participation in Gay Pride as activity. Participation in the gay pride as a activity proposed by the structure of child neuropsychiatry; accompanied there. Fortunately, they noticed the parents and asked the educators of what was done. The educators, aware of having been caught with their hands in the jam, ran for cover saying: ""Ah no, but we were wrong, perhaps we should have warned, we did not know, the grasshoppers ..."". Moreover, some parents also realized why some boys reported ... for example boys - with serious problems - they came home, for a month to that part, saying ""I feel attracted to my own sex and not from the opposite one"", ""I got engaged to my classmate"". They asked the educators' account that in response - news just ago - they decided to leave the project, abandoning families to themselves. This is a very serious thing. I hope there are explanations for all this."

To clear the field in advance from all sorts of interpretation of ""Marzi Pensiero"", without entering specifically of the event recalled, as already mentioned also to the USL company, personally I do not agree to the participation of minors in events that, like this, have over time assumed a political connotation to any political part and if it refers ... Collaga Manfrin, do not make me so foolish. Or alternatively, I agree with the wide participation in any event as long as any preclusion with respect to any political orientation, with a view to allowing the experience and personal growth independently. So if it is true 1, in logic it is also true -1. The USL company, heard on the matter, informed that the events in fact participated a single girl, followed by the service of the USL company, and that the girl herself asked to participate and obtained the approval of the parents. The participation was therefore evaluated by the educators with the involvement of the parents, in line with the psychoeducative support proposed by the territorial educational service. Some minors suffering from neuropsychic problems follow territorial educational paths on individualized therapeutic projects. These projects are presented by the child neuropsychiatrist and are authorized by the mental health assessment unit. In general, the educational activities in the area that provide for the participation of minors are largely born from proposals from the children themselves, take place in the area and are agreed with their parents. The goal is therefore to be able to support them in experience and awareness and therefore in growth and in facing important issues in a critical and responsible sense."

An absolutely due explanation: the participation of a single girl, happened when the parents realized what was going on, because the group - so the classroom and those who are outside know - was 7-8 boys; When the families, who had not been asked, realized the activities that had been proposed obviously they protested vehemence and this totally ceased to participate, if not of that one person you said. That we must therefore get to raise this type of issues within the classrooms to highlight the sacrosanct right of parents to educate children as is deemed most appropriate or to ask for permission from parents to be able to bring children to an event of that type, evidently political, is absurd that it should be affirmed.

Then there is also an aspect that concerns the relationship of trust, at this point, between population and health system, because when you go to the laboratory it is precisely because maybe you need a greater certainty than the usual tests.

Let's start by saying that all the results of the internal and external controls provided for by law, which we will describe, have given positive response. The complex structure laboratory medicine is accredited at regional level in compliance with institutional indications, including the structures that provide performance of medicines and laboratory. In fact, the accreditation implements UNI EN ISO 15 189, integrated by the documents of the Joint Commission International Standard for Clinical Laboratory and the Clinical Pathology Accreditation Standard. The accreditation, widely detailed, meets all the required requirements that have been declined in 8 criteria, 28 requirements and 123 evidences, all verified by the OTA, which is a third, technically accrediting body. Quality controls include both internal controls and external evaluation controls. The quality management system internal to the complex laboratory medicine structure provides for a contact person and clinical risk and a staff consisting of the contacts of each laboratory area. The third party internal quality controls, those not performed and not produced by the supplier company, are managed as per the specific procedure called Iop 14 ECQI both for immunometry and for all other areas of the laboratory. Quality control systems are an integral part of the tender specifications through which healthcare companies acquire technology to be used, including computer science, with quality control parameters that are tested on several concentration levels. In this supervision, nothing is therefore discretionary, occasional, occasional or employee. In addition, the current legislation establishes to the workshops to adhere to quality checks provided through the external evaluation of quality, a verification program that provides for a control body external to the laboratory. In Valle d'Aosta, the evaluation of the external control body is carried out annually by the Regional Center for reference and quality of the Careggi University Hospital based in Florence. The reports of this external body are further verified by a technical commission for the organization, management, coordination and collection of the results of quality controls on clinical analysis laboratories. This commission is renewed every three years and is made up of 5 components, part of the 5 specific associations for each sector of microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, clinical pathology, immunoematology and coagulation. For the year 2023, the external evaluation of quality on the Parini laboratory ended on 14 October 2024 with the positive judgments expressed by all 5 members of the Commission. Therefore, however described, the USL company has an internal and external control system structured for the premature interception of possible errors, aimed at reducing as much as possible the possibility that they can involve damage to the person."

And above all we have not understood if we got back to those who committed that error and evidently did not complete all the checks that you have correctly listed. Most likely, instead of limiting yourself to saying that there were no consequences, however, it was necessary to apologize to the people involved and not to minimize on a situation of this type, because surely those who have been involved some consequences must have reported it."

The topic, in reality, has already been treated on the Council of 20 March and, as communicated on this occasion, apart from the fact that the building is - as well as known - of municipal property, at the moment the priority of the regional administration and the university are focused on the construction of the student and the restructuring of the Giordana building, which will also begin shortly and also includes the construction of the thermal plant at the service of the University, of the Department of Economic Development and then of the renovation of the Belticco building. As already mentioned, we are always available to compare ourselves with the Municipality of Aosta if there are prospects for the recovery of the arches of the plot with a view to an overall enhancement of the areas, but - as I said - at the moment the priorities and resources available for the regional administration are those described above."

I, the day that was the inauguration, came out of the exit of via Monte Solarolo and the impact was truly dramatic: from a new structure, so pleasant, well placed, well placed, done well, to see that ugliness ... To this is also added the fact that the Municipality of Aosta has decided to review the spaces of the Piazza della Repubblica by removing further parking spaces. We had the will, as a group, to understand if this interlocution had been, if there was any perspective and she tells me that you have focused rightly on the study in Cogne and Beltricco.

On October 3, 2024, Sitrasb SpA and TGSB SA signed the memorandum of understanding for the management of the custody and the realization of the renovation of the ventilation insole of the Gran San Bernardo tunnel. On the same date, the competent structure of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport was requested by the appointment of a commission for the technical-administrative testing of the work and on the occasion it was requested if there are developments regarding the process relating to the extension of the concession, reporting the full availability to provide support necessary in order to contribute to the advancement of the aforementioned process. This note is, at the State, without a response. With regard to the issue of invoices issued by TGSB SA, the Sitrasb Spa company recalls that the same were rejected with the request for the issue of related accredited notes, as it was not possible to receive neither to pay invoices relating to an contract organized by the Swiss company without the signing of a specific agreement protocol. Now that this protocol has been signed, mutual economic relations between the two concessionaire companies will be adjusted, in accordance with the provisions of the said protocol. It is believed that the signing of the memorandum of understanding can certainly affect the relationship between the two companies, although it should still be stressed that employment relationships have continued in the spirit of maximum collaboration that has always distinguished employees of both concessionary companies, in the interest of keeping both staff and users safely. The entire infrastructure, to date, does not arouse any particular concern. The third question (if it corresponds to the truth the news reported by the article mentioned in the introduction), the company stresses that the article published in the online newspaper ""Lapimalinea"" on 18/09/2024 contains different inaccuracies. More precisely, it is not the Capp & Marco company knows that it owns 40% of the Gran San Bernardo, Custom Service srl, but Mr. Cappi. During the meeting of the Board of Directors of last June 24, the renewal of the lease contracts of some premises and sites at the stationary station of the tunnel reached the second renewal was included on the agenda. This operation, although falling within the powers of the President, was brought to the attention of the Council precisely by virtue of the fact that President Sitrasb is directly interested in the issue, being a member of one of the two location companies of the properties whose contracts were expiring. The president therefore did not propose the renewal of the lease contracts with a six -year -old formula plus six, without updating the fee, as reported in the article, but has moved away from the classroom, temporarily selling the presidency to the vice -president, engineer Federico Caniggia. The situation in the light of the public majority of Sitrasb and taking into account the considerations also formulated by the company's lawyers, the Board of Directors has considered it not to proceed with a tacit renewal of the contracts and, also to allow the appropriate insights, approved with the cancellation of these lease contracts, giving a mandate to the vice -president of preparing and subscribing to the assessment, about the possibility of the assessment, Subscribe to new contracts and according to which procedure. The Board of Statutory Auditors, having taken note of the above, suggested that an assessment was also carried out regarding the consistency of the premises. Finally, the company specifies that a public notice is being completed for the assignment of the premises will be published as soon as possible. The fourth question requests the position of the head of prevention, corruption and transparency compared to this affair. Regarding the last application, the head of prevention and transparency shows that, together with the president of the supervisory body since 2022 following the designation of the new members of the Board of Directors, he has carried out the appropriate insights regarding the existence of any hypotheses of irrefitability or incompatibility of the president of the office, also in light of the ANAC decisions for similar cases. At the outcome of these analyzes, those responsible for prevention and the president of the supervisory body considered that there were profiles of potential conflict of interest, but with reference to specifications, limited sitrasb activities, or the proposals on promotional tariff policies of the Sisex SA management company and the signing of any new lease contracts, or renewal of the contract in place with the company of the customs expenditure expiring in 1 January 2025 These conclusions have made the subject of a report joined to the documents of the company, subsequently represented by the Board of Directors within the session of 22 July 2022, on the occasion of the settlement of the new supervisory body. The insertion and discussion of the point regarding the renewal of the commercial lease contracts of the premises at the stagnation square of the tunnel therefore took place in the manner already described, without the participation of the President of the Company."

We also learn of the memorandum of understanding which is certainly a step forward. On the other hand, however, it is worrying that now a lot of time has passed, but compared to the question of the extension little or nothing we know, in the sense that again it has mentioned a letter sent to the Ministry, but also this finds no answer, so I could also do the appeal that the colleague aggravates first: that whoever has contacts within that ministry could perhaps take some way, because the problem He worries and must very worry all the regional councilors, because in any case we well know that there are also problems related to European regulations and therefore most likely we should give greater attention.

And I assure you that the Aosta Valley also wonders a lot about this. The will of some political forces and associations present in the Regional Council, and also of political parties that are present in the municipal council of Aosta, to open a political construction site of the autonomist center has been announced. Given the declarations of the President of the Region on the inoption of this initiative that includes forces present in the current majority (Stella Alpina and Pour L'Atto) and opposition forces (Rassemblement Valdôtain), read the declarations of the Councilor for European Affairs (""is like having a curious friend-enemy at home""); Taking into account that even the Democratic Party, which is a majority force, of your majority, required a majority verification; Taking note of yet another political turbulence that is outlining in this troubled legislature, of which we all know the path, we believe that the Council must be the center of the Aosta Valley policy and must however ask itself about what is happening.

I also start asking myself a further question, in addition to those that the Baccega colleague made me: if interest is an interest of the party that represents or if it is a more general interest, because when asking for a political verification or a situation that must be politically and previously analyzed to an act such as that of the budget, which is the political act par excellence and therefore where a majority found communion of intent and finds a convergence on the document presented, or large situations to be analyzed in advance there are no ones. Then I didn't talk about inappropriateness: if it allows me, I talked about prematurity, if we want, of a path that, in my opinion, if they ask me for a personal judgment that I interpret that way, I say that the paths are all possible. If they ask me for an opinion, I allow myself to express it in a temporal sense, in this case, because then I understand very well all the dynamics that remain dynamic, as I said then, to be analyzed at the level of movements and parties to conceive what can be the paths. I also said that if the situations of administrative embarrassment for the continuation of the normal performance of the activities and the government program that we signed in 19 were to occur, then at that point further evaluations will be made. Otherwise, I postponed to the meetings between the movements that are part of our coalition, our government, our majority, to an interlocution with the movement that represents the relative majority within this Council. So, to close, I would say that, in my opinion - then the advice is sovereign on these initiatives -, the document that we will analyze in the first week of December will be a document that will give the pulse of the situation and on what are the intentions by the regional majority and the uniqueness of direction that must be to carry on how much we have taken as a burden towards the population. On the two most punctual questions exhibited by the League group, by colleague Lavy, when you ask me if I was informed in advance, it would probably be a bit to overturn the request, in the sense that there are situations that you live in the corridors daily, in the normal interlocution that there may be to understand if there are reflections to be done in the political field. As for me, I am part of this world as you, there are interlocutions that are obviously part of a path, they were not shared with me because, beyond a mere day a few minutes before the press release came out ... but as it must be, I mean: they are choices that compete with those who bring them to the house; For me, what is important is to have a very clear and very shared path on what are the initiatives that the government and the majority must bring home to correctly close this legislature.

Because it is an operation that essentially has two fathers. It is an agreement, in fact, between majority forces and minority forces and I would like to see how, from a practical point of view, to put together the positions of colleague Marzi and the positions of his colleague Lucianaz on the hospital. It will be interesting to see what the repercussions of this agreement from a practical point of view could be. Provided that then one of the two still remains in the party where he is now and does not migrate perhaps towards other autonomist shores. It was her, President of Testalin, who talked about a hasty birth. A six -month birth. I borrow its metaphor: an agreement that has two fathers. An agreement that on the one hand makes water a bit from all sides, a bit like the new university, and what unites this agreement with the new university? Bruno Milanesio: here is the first father of this political operation. But who is the other father? She is himself, President of Testalin, the other father of this political operation, because this is a real motion of no confidence to her by two councilors in the council, who - we learned it before - did not even tell him a little before this operation, she said a few minutes before he came out in the newspaper. Let's say that there is a little bit of rude. This was perhaps the result of some of his attitudes, of his behaviors. We see it inside the advice: sometimes it often has a centralizing tendency, not to say arrogant, on some themes, on some ways to carry on. We see him in the advice, I imagine in the junta what is the environment with which the councilors also have to work, perhaps because in some areas there is also a little confrontation. However, there is a doubt that comes out, completely spontaneous: that this operation perhaps has certainly not hindered her, indeed, after all it goes even well, because now she finally has a pretext to possibly return to early elections. A pretext that was obviously difficult to create in normal situations, which instead now has it in hand and that she can obviously pull out when she prefers, knowing very well that if she went to early elections, she candidate, if she took many votes - which I honestly wish you - could redo the president again; Which, if instead it went to September, could probably not do. In the face of her colleagues, including party, who instead would spend that she can take a step back, one step away, but these are your internal issues.

Among other things, in hindsight, if the cost had been this, maybe we would have asked him for advice to better organize the meetings of the construction site better in the Pollein crot. I must say that, given the figure, maybe he could have brought potatoes, Saucisse and Bodeun, because he sees - colleague Baccega - when we arrived, you had already passed by Forza Italia and you had eaten everything. Having said that, I must say that the question at least did some light not only on the figure, but also on what are the activities, because objectively in the subject of the performance and in the reason for the assignment there were very vague passages, including ""developing the image by updating its styles and content"", which is a great program, and ""coordination of promotional communication activities"". Above all, on the development of the image, we wanted to understand for a moment and we will make some further insights because objectively - I do not remember if it was in the penultimate, the advice before that of the Defr - I had already brought to the attention of the classroom the fact that after the study had been done and the Defr had been released, an assignment had also been released for a consultancy company that is the one that has already followed the study for the construction of the industrial plan. All this seems to us a little strange because, beyond the fact that we must understand how to put the goal of the Defr on the ground (this we have already discussed it), understand how this primary consultancy company can mainly deal with the future development part not only of the image, but, in general, of the management of the gambling house, and on the other side we now also find advice in this field, together with others. It seems to us that there is a very confused activity. The only thing: perhaps, in the representation of the fees, where we must give transparency, it would be appropriate to make the passage more understandable. But I think that those of the gaming house and management are listening to us will take note and will make due rectification."

Of course, he played his colleague Margurettaz very well. I understand that the colleague aggravation can be annoyed by the statements that I have done, but they are real and concrete things and the fact that he is angrily in some way certifies it. We did not go to eat Saucisse and Bodeun and boiled potatoes in that of Pollein to build an autonomist center. We do our way, we make our way to the center -right, we are aware of the fact that we are putting a serious program for the Aosta Valley to create an alternation; We do not go to incitement or electoral signs that will then be used for the future.

The second question that the colleague asked (""When will the scheme of implementation rules on the concessions of water derivation will be sent to the Valle d'Aosta regional council?"") I believe that he has already had a response, considering that on 30 October the scheme of implementation rules was sent to the President of the Regional Council in order to acquire the opinion by this assembly. For the third question (""what are actually the administrative obligations of the legislative affairs and state aid office ensures the components of regional appointment in the sense of the joint commission for the purposes of the functioning of the same""), the members of the regional part of the joint commission appointed by the Council are normally expert in legal matters, I would also say authoritative experts, or regional councilors, and the support of the organizational structure of legislative affairs and state aids in the procedures for the procedures for the procedures payment of the emoluments due to members of the regional part, as required by the resolution of the regional council 775 of 2024."

I do not understand what in all respects seems to me to be a reticence, also an omission of information, because on the region's website, under the item ""legislative affairs and state aid"", in point 9, it is said ""also on the impulse of the head of the cabinet, provides support for the components of regional appointment within the joint commission referred to in article 48 bis of the special statute, ensuring the administrative obligations necessary for its operation"". Now she tells me that the work of this office is substantiated in the payment of the emoluments! I believe that we can say everything we want, but if the head of cabinet has to give its support to pay the emoluments ... it seems to me something strange! Among other things, emoluments that are obviously paid by the Valle d'Aosta region, which has established these amounts with its resolution which are 12,000 euros gross per year. Amounts that, in my opinion, would also justify some more communication, at least on the orders of the day, on the content of what is being discussed, at least the object, rather than the content, let's put it this way. We do not have the minutes, we have no knowledge of the calls, she told us on October 2nd that from April to that day, on 30 September, the joint commission met twice. So, if you know that she met twice, some information has succeeded, Vivaddio, to find it, perhaps asking directly from the colleague who is a member of joint or the minister of regional affairs or the president of the joint commission! I don't know who. However, she told us that there were two meetings. It is something that does a little species, also because then she told us another thing, namely that the implementation rule had been approved by the joint commission on September 30th. Then we receive the scheme, and in the scheme that was broadcast by the Minister for Regional Affairs on September 30, and then the protocol is from 31, what was sent to us, there is the implementation scheme and the date of approval is reported - and there are no others, not even at the bottom - which dates back to 29 July. So, it may be that between those two meetings of which she had spoken to us on October 2, there were that of 29 July and that of September 30. However, there is a problem, because, as I said, if the date of approval is July 29, three months have passed since the approval to the transmission of the implementation of the norm of implementation. If it had been approved on 30 September, however, a month would have passed, and they seem long times; If, on the other hand, the approval had intervened on October 14, as I have already said once, given that it is a different date, then perhaps the times would be understandable and reasonable, because 15 days they can be there, but many more, for the signing of a minister on an act that has performed all his process, many seem to me. I have already said and I repeat that this question of dates is not trivial. It is not trivial because there are no small implications. In the coming weeks, after 5 years of waiting, we will finally be able to enter the merits and in detail of the text; We hope not to find inconsistencies such as to make it of poor effectiveness. At a first reading not everything seems so clear to us and above all it does not seem to us a text marked by that autonomist fierté that should characterize the implementation regulations of the special autonomy statute."

To these will be added the funds allocated with the bill of second variation of forecast 2024-2026, for a total of approximately 23 million euros, which the regional council approved this morning, Wednesday 6 November, which will be immediately sent to the presence of the Council for the start of the examination of the Commissions.

The novelties compared to the applications submitted to obtain the layoffs, however - as regards the second application - the offices of the Policy of Labor and Training Department contacted the INPS which has ensured the utmost attention to the questions by reporting that many of these are incomplete and therefore it was requested, and it is necessary, to accompany them with additions."

Certainly that communication that we had asked for and urged in that resolution voted in July, which asked for a weekly reporting commitment compared to this issue, was missing. Compared to the questions of layoffs, I note that many months have passed and actually they are already activities that are in difficulty: not having any answers compared to this part is certainly heavy for them, so I hope that even compared to incomplete questions there will be an answer as soon as possible, because there are also closures, in some way, because - as I say - precisely those in good faith, perhaps they have not fired, has however decided to maintain personal, now they are also found in this situation.

Specifically, the project is aimed at children of the fifth classes of primary school and, in 2025-2026, also to those of the first year of the first grade secondary school. I remember that the approach of children to the mountain is important to promote complete physical activity, within everyone's reach, aimed at improving psychological well -being. A right approach to the mountain, starting from the preparations for the execution of the excursion, from backpack to clothing and equipment, to learn how to behave correctly along the path, respecting the environment, flora and fauna, it is essential for today's young people to know the world that surrounds them better and can use it more consciously, even in an orientant perspective in the future. Specifically, in collaboration with the Alpine Guides, the following programs have been proposed: ""The mountain around us"" (focused on culture and hiking, to make known the mountains surrounding the school or the country where the children live); ""The Vertical Mountain"" (focused on climbing, to make sports climbing known, highlighting how this can be fun and training from a psychomotor point of view. Particular attention will be paid to making children, teachers and families understand that this activity does not present objective risks when practiced correctly); ""Immersion in nature"" for a first grade secondary school, school year 2025-2026, focused on culture and outdoor activities on two days. I also want to emphasize that this project has an inclusive character as it involves all children, even those with motor disabilities, thanks to the intervention of specialized alpine guides, in addition to those already foreseen in the individual programs. The first two programs include, in analogy with the ""slip"" project, a theoretical part in the class of two modules, together with a practical part with exits on the territory. The theoretical part, the first form, consists in the standardized presentation, about 15-20 minutes, similar for all schools, with video-photographic support on the Aosta Valley mountains and on the various activities that can be carried out. Following, there is a specific intervention for each school with short videos and photos specifically referred to the reality surrounding the school and the Municipality concerned. In this part of intervention, in addition to the characteristics of the surrounding environment, the various activities that can be carried out on the territory itself will be explained briefly. Then there is a second module, which is the explanation of how to prepare a backpack and how to program a simple trip on the mountains in front of the house: weather, maps, paths, attention to any bulletins, etc. The duration is 15-20 minutes. A game with pupils divided into groups will then be proposed, the goal will be to prepare a backpack by choosing the suitable material for a certain excursion. Then there is a practical part that is the ""Mountain around us"" program. There are two exits on the territory lasting 3-4 hours each, which will consist of a winter session (January-February) walking on a path/easy soil possibly snowy, with explanation of the characteristics of the surrounding mountains, therefore slopes, plans, sunshine, different aspects of vegetation, therefore the adret or the envers, consideration on the glaciations that have formed the Vallivo furrow, except. Then there is a spring session (April-May), a treasure hunt with the aim of making the boys move autonomously on outdoor soil, stimulating them to work in a group. The ""Vertical Mountain"" program consists of two exits lasting 3-4 hours each, climbing on natural or artificial sites based on logistics convenience. The period is to be defined on the basis of the location and availability of indoor structures. The cost of the project per class group is 1650 euros plus VAT, if due, which includes basic cost-cost cost for the theoretical and practical part; The cost includes the living expenses of the Alpine guides, transport, meals, etc. and the equipment necessary to carry out the program. The administration has allocated 20,000 euros for 2025 for the experimentation of the project, involving three educational institutions of the first cycle of education in the school year 2024-2025. With what criteria and methods will the classes that will be part of this experimental project be identified? Being an experimental project, we will start with three educational institutions identified according to the following criteria: territoriality (therefore media and low valley, Aosta and neighboring municipalities, high valley); Number of planning, with regional ownership. Already initiated by the educational institution according to a rotation principle, in order to guarantee participation in the greatest number of pupils attending the Aosta Valley schools."

Above all, to each question that was asked with the question, we tried to give answers for each point in the most appropriate way. It is a theme to which, as Rassemblement Valdôtain, we have always placed a lot of attention and much importance, because in any case we know that the theme of the mountain and everything that concerns it is a theme that we can try to improve and change things a little, if we start from a change starting from young people and young people. So very well that you start better to carry on greater initiatives and more and more in synergy with other initiatives, in an integrated way, touching the various aspects that concern the mountain, nature, safety, the risks that can happen on that ground every day. So it is a project that we look very carefully, but at the same time we hope that, as it happens many times, there are projects that start on an experimental level or there are opportunities where ... for example here it is said that the state has contributed for this project - I took information from this article - with 67,000 euros and the region has integrated the resources to complete the project, which therefore amounted to a total amount of 115,000 euros; That they are not initiatives that, as I repeat, are very important, they are carried out a year and then maybe there is discontinuity, but there is continuity on these issues that we believe important and strategic, especially in these periods, in which we see that in the mountains there are more and more climate changes to manage suddenly and therefore go to raise awareness of young people, to try to understand the dynamics also of how we move in the mountains. The sporting aspect but also linked precisely to its morphology of the territory, is very important, especially from a didactic point of view and then also of the field approach. This is an aspect. In the article it was spoken that up to 18 years of age in Valle d'Aosta the percentage is the highest regarding the boys who practice sports activities, but then unfortunately the Aosta Valley move away from the ski. Here it would be important to understand if you stop there in the article or or understand from data or statistics that you may have or that you can deepen, if it concerns only skiing or a drop in other disciplines and therefore understand if you can go to work in multiple sectors. Another very important aspect is that we suggest, as you have well said, obviously starting from this end of the year and then next year we will select some educational institutions, then a tot of classes, a tot of limited pupils to start on an experimental basis with this initiative, obviously the hope is that then over the years the resources available are increased, expanded the project to try to allow a greater number of children, therefore to as many schools possible, To travel this way to get to great goals to better educate all young people on what are the opportunities and risks of the mountain and therefore of what is concretely the Aosta Valley for their future. This is what. Finally, it would also be very appropriate to transmit, in addition to all the positive aspects that you have mentioned in the answer, also that concept of self -responsibility that, when we face the law of revision of the regional legal system, we will have within an article, therefore also this step, bring it within this initiative, we believe that it can be a great opportunity to go to start this path in the best way."
47923,XVI,06/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,5175,"The councilor questions the government to have news about the members of the technical coordination table for the development of renewable energy communities. The technical table is composed of the following subjects: Sustainable energy development structure, Valley Chamber of Companies and Professions, Consortium of the local Authorities of the Aosta Valley, CoE Energia of Finaosta, below Coa Energia. Each of these components identifies its own representative or its competent delegate on the subject. The tasks of the table are identified in the 5 paragraphs provided for the article and give the table a whole series of activities ranging from the promotion to encourage the creation of self -consumption configurations on the regional territory, to analyze the monitoring data of the widespread self -consumption configurations, where available, to proactively discussing the evolution of self -consumption configurations spread on the regional territory, to propose any improvement of the improvement of address for the implementation of this law, to prepare an annual report for the regional councilor responsible for energy for the purposes of the subsequent illustration to the reference council commission. For the first question (""If the representatives of Celva and Chambre in the technical table will be chosen as qualified experts""), as highlighted in the premises, the choice of the representatives in charge is entrusted to the free choice of subjects participating in the technical table. Leaving aside the definition ""perimeter of the characteristics, it must have an official or an expert in order to be declared qualified expert"", it is difficult, in this first phase of implementing the legislation in the field of widespread self -consumption, to be able to identify qualified personnel expert both for the almost absence of training courses in this area, and for the short period of time that has passed since the complete definition of the regulatory framework on the subject. Therefore, as specified by the table establishment of the table, the participating subjects identify their representative on the issues relating to the CER, which we remember to be varied and diversified as they involve knowledge not only energy, but also legal and social, as well as the verification of the methods of application and impact of the legislation and related implementation measures with respect to the public administration and companies. It is also specified that the presence of Celva and Chambre at the technical table is not aimed at the only contribution of technical knowledge on the subject in question, but it is above all also useful for the purposes of the interlocution with the territory, as a reference stakeholder for local authorities and businesses, subjects potentially interested in the development of renewable energy communities. While waiting for the formalization of the designation of the members of the technical table, a first meeting was held last Monday 28 October; During the same it has been highlighted how each subject will be able to make use of specific consultancy and collaborations, which can be involved in the work of the table. In particular, as regards the Region and the Energia, the collaboration already in place with the GSE is highlighted, the start of contacts with RSE for the definition of a collaboration agreement, in addition to the advice activated with the Sani Zangrando studio for the legal-administrative aspects. It should also be noted that, if the technical table highlights the need to find highly specialized professionalism on specific issues to be deepened, external experts may be involved and any deriving expenses will be able to find coverage in the annual operational plans of the Energia. ""What are the names and qualifications of the components, the CER Technical Table and with what measure have been identified?"": Similarly to what has been done on other technical tables, there is no adoption of a specific measure for the identification of components, but obviously each body appoints them with the measures that considers appropriate. The names have been identified by the participating subjects and will be transmitted formally. As regards the Energia of Finaosta for the meeting of the table of 28 October, a note was sent with the designation of Genny Brunet to replace Andrea Comé. The formal designation was made on October 31 to the Board of Directors. We wait for the appointment to be formalized and registered. As for the Chambre, Federico Molino participated. Here too, the chamber is preparing the deed of appointment and as regards Celva was represented by Mattia Calliano and Sara Pinet was appointed. As for sustainable energy development, Tamara Cappellari, Simone Gamba and Ingrid Bal took part. ""On what date the meeting of the technical table was held or will take place?"": This first table took place on October 28 and it will be there shortly formalized by all the bodies, a second meeting in the next few weeks."
47923,XVI,06/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,3549,"I, when I read resolution 1166 of 23 September last, I must say that I felt a certain bewilderment, councilor, because it is a resolution that resumes, but only in part, what is foreseen by that law that we discussed and voted here in July: the resolution in fact nothing says on the actual composition of the technical table; That is, it simply follows the part of the article in law, and this is the reason why I filed the question, because - she will surely remember it - in the processing of law number 15 - the colleagues will also remember - a particular attention had been paid to the identification of the tasks and the composition of that table. We had insisted that the subjects and the characteristics of these subjects that we believed were important, should be indicated in law. You had preferred that they only indicated in the relationship, not in the articulated. In that resolution, however, there is no need for the need for the representatives of the Chambre and Celva to be qualified technicians, as had been agreed, because we had made a mediation to achieve the approval of that law and in the resolution we saw we expected the names, also because two months had now passed. We all expected that there was some more information, because the establishment and operation of the table is an absolutely urgent thing. Now she tells us that there has been a first meeting that, if I understood well, is not the one that has already formalized the complete composition of the table, but is preparatory to it. He told us that Dr. Molino participated for the Chambre, for Celva Calliano, but this classification, let's say, this characteristic of the experience is not there. She says to me ""must not only be technicians with knowledge in the energy field, but there must also be someone who knows the economic reality and that of the Municipalities well""; Nobody says no, but what had been agreed was an absolutely different thing. This response does not satisfy me because the mediation to which one had been reached was not respected. The other question is that we have approved a law, if I remember correctly, on 27-28 in July; On October 28 (therefore three months have passed), this table still formally does not exist, because someone has appointed, someone has to name, the formal designation of the CoA has arrived, but the others are waiting for. I believe that a different march should be messed because there is an urgency that we have reported over and over again and that concerns the process that implies the creation, constitution and spread of the CER, because as regards the Cer public we are absolutely on the high seas and - as I have already said more than once - we are worried because the impression is that there is no concrete and an effective will to operate. Not only that. The Cer movement in the Aosta Valley could be robust and should be widespread; We saw the announcement that was issued, but it seems to us, because we also talked to someone, that mayors and administrators are in difficulty and we are always and more convinced, even compared to before, that without a regional direction the risk is that something extremely minimal, limited and not very incisive will be realized at the end. In our opinion, it is a shame, because there is a risk of not fully grasping an opportunity that is important and that in our region could have a significant development."
47924,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,2,5059,"Connect Manfrin, I struggled to organize the answer. I sincerely say this, but in the sense that, if it is possible to have some more information, I make the commitment to complete it, because from some premises it was difficult to try to organize an answer. In any case, to come to the first question (""if you are aware of what has been reported""), there is more than one report here, but precise references are missing. I repeat, I will try to give it some answers, but we consider the initiative open to subsequent information. As for the first premise (a letter has been sent to the information bodies that says that the bus takes an hour and a half), there are different travel times: there are, for example, the Aosta-Noti bus bus, which put us less than an hour. The replacement service must, by nature, try to respond to all users in the area, so there are buses that make all the stops, there are direct buses, there are seed buses, those who bring people to the low valley, and we are increasingly using motorway routes and therefore travel times are not an hour and a half, but they can also be an hour and a half when we have to give continuity to people's trips. ""Learned from reports received - I go to the premises because I think the question is articulated on the various premises - that sometimes the replacement buses provided do not concretely carry out the service"": it does not appear to us, there is also all a check that is done, of course, and when it happens this is reported. The stock starts if it must be replaced, but a service must be done; When it is not made in some way it goes - unless something particular has happened - integrated with the organization they gave us. We extended the stocks to give continuity to all seasons and to understand well what the effects of the service are. Then there is another consideration: ""I specifically learned that on 16 September on the three races expected at the start in Ivrea, with two who had ... the"" semi -direct ""race expected was suppressed ..."" there is a long premise, we have not been able to understand here what it was and therefore maybe if you have more information I still collect it. On September 16 there was a change of timetables, so I don't know if this was reported to that moment of change of the time, if there are more information, but, I repeat, compared to this we make the commitment to make a further verification. The episode of the Trasbord seems very strange to us, we have not had news and, I repeat, there is a control both from Trenitalia and on our part with adequate service. If there is something that has gladly escaped we deepen it. Finally, it is said ""learned cases of suppression of the expected races that have occurred several times"": the suppression of the races certainly does not appear to this measure, it can happen; In the specific case it can happen in some situations. It happens almost more on the railway section because then there are interruptions that are due to the problems of infrastructure and can happen in this sense. Those are then reproduced with the motorway races. However, I repeat, all this is an objective of deepening and well, if there are reports, we will complete our analysis. To come to the second question (""If the managers of the replacement races have informed the Department about the suppressed runs""): compared to information, we are directly that we intervene through Trenitalia, there is an operating room that works daily compared to the organization of the services. If there are suppressions, there is a whole procedure that is activated and we verify sample - a very important sample with our services - the quality of the service made by traveling directly with the staff who deal with these checks on replacement buses. As for ""if replacement runs have been paid to the managers of the section without the service being made"", this must not happen, there is a contract that regulates relationships. We work on a quarterly basis. All runs are the subject of a check. At each race there is a recording of the starting and arrival points, so if this happens, this must fall into this quarterly relationship, where the checks and payments of the case are then made. So, I repeat, it is an answer, mine, perhaps not so detailed. If there are more timely information or more punctual requests, we continue to deepen, and, I repeat, precisely because all this is regulated, the Region ... The contract is managed by Trenitalia, who has entrusted Busitalia to Busitalia through a manager. We are not those who manage the contract, but obviously we incur the expenses, as we incurred them for rail transport, therefore available to continue checking the services."

The problem is that - I summarize it in summary, then at this point I will make her have precise reports - I think it is a little difficult to reconstruct ex post what happened, but I believe that the part of her clearest and more effective response is the one where she says that she is not suppressions of races. In reality, what has been reported is that instead these suppressions have been there and have been made on several occasions and trivially on Sunday there has been a real labor to be able to go down to Turin. Four hours of travel between suppressions, missed coincidences with the trains, drivers who announced that the train would wait because there was the famous delay, the one that was spoken of even today with the Santhià shoulder straps, and then after in reality no train waited and then there was then a dilation of the times. There are some critical issues that, however, evidently, from its response shows that they are not communicated; At this point we will dictate them with the times and times. I don't know if with the detail of the times of the times she will be able to go to the company to ask for these suppressions because, at this point, if they have not been communicated, the answer will be ""to us does not appear""; But clearly the indications are there. Trivially, I believe that, however, by reporting at least this, that is, the letter that has been transmitted and published by some information bodies with respect to the question of travel times, you could have viewed - I imagine - at least of this. I guess yes. On this at least he was able to reconstruct and I think it is the part of which you spoke, that is, the question of the sections that take more time or less time. What you point out to her is that perhaps there are some inconsistencies that must be deepened, especially when it is said that there are a number of replacement buses that carry out a service and then in reality they are a lower number, so probably some in -depth analysis will be done in this sense and we will provide you with all the documentation. For the moment, we thank you and we are sure that at least this report - although not so precise and exhaustive, but we were convinced that she was aware of everything - will stimulate greater attention from this moment on."

The question is ""If all the preparatory activities provided for the period January-May 2024 are concluded"": the preparatory activities for the work in progress have concluded, certain preparatory activities must still be carried out as functional to the works that will be carried out subsequently. Point two (""If all the works whose program provided for the start of the works in the months of June, July, September, October 2024 have actually started""), heard RFI, which confirms that the work in progress are aligned with the program. ""With what system and methods does the Region provide for permanent monitoring on the construction of the works?"": Obviously, the monitoring takes place through the continuous interlocutions of the technical structures with the technical structures of RFI, through a punctual control also by the structures with respect to the advancement of the design. Obviously, it is not the region that manages the contract with the company that creates the works and therefore the interlocution is a continuous interlocution with RFI. At this moment there are daily contacts with the other actors who must be affected by the construction sites, in particular local authorities, because there is a programming both with respect to the work of the railway and compared to what must then be bought in terms of viability and travel and construction sites, also on the investments that are carried out, affecting the regional roads or municipal roads. Work is a job that takes into consideration the many aspects and the many complexities on which we must try to work together, advanced quickly, also given the execution times of these works which, remember, will have to end by June 2026."

On that occasion, which was the one in which the protocol was also signed, some detail, in the first part, had come; Then, as we said this morning, on the question of the memorandum of understanding, it had been said and, in my opinion, little there is also in what I received, because I expected different things. But, beyond this, the time schedule, which I had received with access to the documents in May 2024, included a whole series of works, of detailed, very detailed interventions, with the starting dates and was on what I wanted to have confirmations. She told me that she aligned with what was the time schedule. I would have been happier if she had made a detail, also because as regards, for example, the electrical subsits: for Aosta we were talking about the start of work in October 2024, as well as for what concerns the traveler interventions and buildings, in July 2024. I on the question of Aosta are not so sure that it is all this -also because October has ended a few days ago, this must also be said -, but we hope that this chronoprogram is followed. how it was sent. There had also been said that there could be changes, because in progress it is possible that it is so, but at the moment she tells us that everything is confirmed, so we will check. On the question of the ways in which the Region monitor you, she says ""It is not we who have the work, it is RFI, so there is an interlocution, but they are the ones who have to follow the works more specifically"". Here, what we recommend is certainly that there is a control, as I am sure that it has been done and I hope it will continue to be there, punctual and continuous. I say this also because I know that there are difficulties for what also concerns the staff who must be in charge of this, given that unfortunately there are no shortage shortcomings and it is not a fault, but it is a fact. On the question of the time schedule she said to me ""we are aligned"" and did not tell me about variations, so I take for good what had been delivered in May and we will try to verify these works on time, as they were done."

The first question asks for the state of the design of the works relating to the hypothesized star of the Couis: the executive design of the new Pila-Couis Telacabine and of the panoramic bar-officer was approved by the Board of Directors of the Pila company on 10/06/2024, following the conclusion with a positive result of the preventive verification activity provided for article 26 of Legislative Decree 50/2016. Consequently, during the summer of 2024, it was possible to run the execution of the panoramic bar-restaurant at the same time as the execution of the second trunk of the cable car. With reference to the panoramic bar-restaurant, all reinforced concrete structures, those in metal carpentry and a part of the civil systems are completed at present. The completion of the coverage and the laying of the external tamponing windows are under construction, while the completion of the works with the completion of civil systems and the finishes is expected during the next summer. ""If the realization of a study has been foreseen to identify the best management configuration of the refuge"": yes, a study is expected. The company has commissioned an expert professional on the subject, with an economic financial plan relating to the refreshment point, in which the financial, economic and economic reflections deriving from the implementation of the investment of the relative management are summarized. With regard to the Tre question (""timing and costs of the entire Pila-Couis cableway operation, including the snowfall systems, water and fuel adoption, renewable energy systems, Refuge construction""), the chronoprogram of the works provides for the completion of the works during the next summer, with the construction of the first trunk of the system of the service center provided at the starting station and the complement of the panoramic bar The start of the winter season 2025-2026. With regard to the ancillary works, in particular to the interventions to adapt the slopes, including the construction of the Paravalanghe and Anti -Anti -fall protection systems and the planned snow system, all expected interventions have been almost completed, with the exception of some line sections of the interfering snow system, which will consequently be carried out during the next summer. The overall cost of the work, including the bar-restaurant, accessory works, track adjustment, snow-snow system, protection systems and everything you need, is greater than 60 million euros and is distributed through direct funding of the pile, funding with self-financing and the use of the funding provided for by law 8. Surely, before the start of the Christmas holidays, the second truncation of the plant will be activated, the one that connects Couis 1, It will already be starting from this year the possibility of using a part of the system. The goal of the company is to accelerate the final operations, of investment, to be able to complete the tests even before the holidays, however, at the moment, we are unable to give a definitive and certain date of starting the use of this second truncation."

I have to rectify the criticism I did in last advice when - I already had the opportunity to say it on the street - I gave her a seriously insufficient vote. I saw that then the elevation was placed here at the station and therefore good for the prompt intervention. It is also true that in that elevation a bike is there and I didn't think he was, so I change from ""seriously"" to ""only insufficient"" that answer. Anyway, thanks. Instead we talk about pile. The Couis Star ... on February 8 I had asked her these questions and she rightly, answering the work that was proceeding, the work to carry out the upstream truncation, had the opportunity to say that the works relating to the panoramic refreshment point will be launched during the next summer - as has actually confirmed me now -, performed simultaneously with the construction of the second trunk of the riding system. At the same time, however, he said, ""the executive project relating to the non -cable car works is in the improvement phase, it will be subjected to the verification of article 26 as soon as possible, etc."", what he still said. And I am stopped there; I probably lost passages, but she remembers well and I understand that she has many commitments, but she had promised us to provide us with a somewhat more complete detail of the study, we had asked for some planning, some graphic reports of this work, we have not achieved anything and now we are with this work already made. The second question concerned the study carried out, if you could have a relationship or a hint in the commission. He had also promised us that he would come to the commission to report. I have not heard anything about the Pila station, but this study on the management of the Couis 1 refuge, if there was a way to have some more information, I think it is useful for the whole population. We learn that before the holidays, trunk II will probably be in operation, so it is certainly good news that everyone is waiting with trepidation; But I on the star structure of the Couis - and I have marked it in the premises - I continue to have several perplexities, because we have the commissioner Sapinet, the president of the Testalin who continue to remind us that there is a dramatic climate change, extreme weather conditions that involve a different way of managing the mountains or territory and then we make a structure that I will be curious to see how much he will be able to resist the impact placed on the platform of Grevon, from the weather; But let's hope in the sun, that there are always beautiful days. I continue to have doubts, I am curious to see what will be realized. I repeat that we have not seen a document that is one, a project that is one. We have to trust his words.

Obviously, the government on these two factories, but as on the general situation as regards the automotive, has continuous contact with the activity of companies having tasks that can obviously be neither of management nor of direct intervention, but of relationships with respect to the activity and relapse of a situation that at the level, in particular, is European, is determining great problems on all that is the automotive supply chain, even in important countries such as Germany. We have all read negotiations that are underway compared to some large manufacturers, so all this in some way at this moment creates problems for the whole supply chain. From what you learn, but also from what we have said right now, it is still a moment of management of the situation. They are two slightly different situations, those of the two plants: ITT is completely linked to the automotive sector, while Eltek for a part of his production begins to work also in the biomedical sector. This is a bit the result of the research activity of the past years, we hope that in this perspective a supply chain can continue to grow within the company production that goes in this direction, so that this diversify production, as always, can also be useful with respect to the general market situation. For the rest of the production, Eltek also deals with the sector of household appliances and automotive, therefore compared to this, at this moment, there are some attention. What I was able to see in relations with the two companies is that however it is a limited period, asked greater than what is the real use, in particular for now we deal with ... the layoffs on the Eltek concerns a complete shift of work for a department. The hope is that there is a recovery starting from the next half of the semester, but it does not depend now directly on the company. Same thing is true for Itw, which above all also tried to regulate the management of the warehouses precisely because there is at this moment a drop and the request for layoffs serves to try to better organize the work stopping phase, trying to distribute this on all workers in an equitable way, trying to be as follow as possible not to burden on one department rather than another. The commitment I have at this moment is to maintain contact with these two companies and to continue investing in the research sectors trying to create conditions for all companies in general, not only these, they can continue to try to build development projects, even in different directions, and what we have made the commitment to do is suffering in the first days of December to understand if the situation will remain or if in the next semester, there may be any new values, by the two factories. The automotive sector does not concern only these two companies. As I said, we are also in contact with other companies that are trying to better manage this phase, which is a phase of slowdown in the market and we reiterate what every now and then we say here - in particular colleague Perron supports it in a very determined way - there is a need that the European government and the Italian government are very clear about the automotive development projects, on the investments to be dedicated to companies. There is the great discussion in Italy linked to Stellantis because, as we all know, the growth projects, in particular of the electric car, have not been respected. There are production contractions that need to see development programs financed at European level, at Italian level, so that industries can return to support a production cycle that gives the best possible response to workers and also to the development of our territories."

In these weeks, however, the unions have strongly paid attention to these two factories precisely for the question of layoffs of which she spoke and above all because from this point of view we do not see - or at least it is what we learned by reading the press releases -, great glimpses in this sense. There is a strong concern, so it would certainly be important sometimes to be able to face the question of industry in Valle d'Aosta, which is not only CAS, but above all in the low valley, it is certainly an important reality and perhaps she is better than others, therefore certainly from this point of view also the fact of being extremely linked to the automotive and above all to Stellantis is leading these companies to be in difficulty. We will surely pay ahead again attention to these plants to understand if somehow the companies have found a way to recover, well aware of what she said compared to the general crisis of the automotive at this moment."

As in the question, the Palaindoor is inserted among those works defined as regional interest, as this regional administration intended to contribute to the costs of the Municipality of Aosta for the works of implementation of the system for the purpose of obtaining the fire prevention certification. In particular, two different resolutions have been adopted for this purpose. We retrace the route: with the first, the 1438 of November 2021, the Region provided for a total funding of 470,000 euros in favor of the Municipality of Aosta as a contribution for the coverage of 50% of the prior costs for the fire adaptation of the Palaindoor. Of these, 150,000 euros relate to the works of the first lot which ended at the end of 2022 and have allowed, as the proposer, the reactivation, starting from February 2023, also recalls some sports activities in the structure: tennis, athletics and sports climbing. The additional 320,000 euros allocated by the Region instead concern the works of the second lot in the course of completion. With the second resolution, the number 1471 of December 2022, the Region has granted an update of the loan, mentioned above, to partial coverage of what are the costs of costs due to the adaptation of prices for supplies and works, of the total amount of 84,000 euros, of which 20,000 on the first lot and 64,000 on the second lot. Having made these premises, which testify to the concrete commitment of the regional administration so that the Palaindoor structure can be returned to its entirety as soon as possible to sports groups, associations, individual citizens, passed to the two questions by answering what was received by the Municipality of Aosta. The first question that the colleague asks us is ""on what date does it hypothesize to use all the structures that make up the sports facility""? We received the answer from the Municipality of Aosta which makes us know that, except for unexpected events, the works relating to the second lot, indicated as phase one interventions, will end in next December. By the end of March 2025, the conclusion of the administrative practices relating to the obtaining of the fire prevention certificate and subsequently the Municipality provides to deliver the building to the Sport and the Concessionaire office is envisaged. As for the second question, ""on which organization can the complete management of the sporting structure be taken in hand, that many regions envy us?"", In relation to this point, the Municipality of Aosta recalls that with the City Council resolution, on 148 of 5 August 2024, it was decided to start the temporary entrusted procedure for the management of the Palaindoor to run from 1 July 2024 until 31/12/2024, proceeding with the formal request to the old. manager. In addition, he established to proceed in identifying the municipal administration, through a possible collaboration with the Regional Committee of the Coni della Valle d'Aosta, of a new manager and the verification of the seriousness of the management, as well as the exact fulfillment of the conditions of entrusting the structure itself, in identifying the most suitable forms of management of the structure. Also the Municipality of Aosta reported that in the months of August and September he has carried out various meetings with the regional cones contact person to define in detail what is the collaboration agreement between the two entities. To date, therefore, the procedure is in the final phase and, except for any unexpected events, the agreement can be approved and signed between the parties by the end of October 2024. It is acknowledged that President Bertin is summarized from 19:04."

Alas, Aosta, the European city of sport, in 2023 the Aosta Valley European Sports Region. For four years - almost five - the Palaindoor has been removed from sports activities and the world of sport. First used as a vaccination hub, then used for the question of design and to carry out the work for obtaining the CPI. Also there three phases, an unprecedented bizarre. Now two lots of works that have gone very slowly. Then the opening in sob rightly, but there we spent little there; On this side, she urged the other, in the end all the Outdoor sport managed to open (the tennis that is outside, the sports climbing and subsequently also the athletic structure). But at the moment it is still closed. Closed spaces, still non -plastered walls, the closed restaurant bar, which is a fundamental element. Probably there too there will be a delay because the refrigerated desks, which have been stopped for four years, will need to be changed. The fact that there is not a manager even now, despite the municipal administration has asked all the structures of the third sector to deal with this thing and this is truly a great failure of this troubled legislature. We really hope that CONI can take in hand ... At this moment ASVA has it. ASVA manages what he can manage because obviously he has given it to the companies that somehow can practice the activity. The truth is that that structure needs a manager. A capable and competent manager who must be financed because it is not that it can be there to transpose the remuneration of sports clubs, federations, because we know there is no money. It is still - we emphasize - a mortification, for the world of sport everything, have a structure that had been looked at us carefully from all regions. ""But how, in Valle d'Aosta did you do that stuff there?"". Yes, we made a building of that type, which is multipurpose, which serves many sports activities. Unfortunately it has been closed for four and a half years and more. However, thank you for the answers that were certainly exhaustive and gave us information, the ones we asked. The hope is really that you go ahead and I also look at the councilor for sport, which I am sure that it will be careful to ensure that this is ended as soon as possible. We know that CONI could manage. There is nothing better than Coni to manage that thing, but it must be financed, because the money does not come from Rome. Let's say it right away."

We had obviously asked the Municipality of Aosta the answer, given that the question is relating to an activity of the Municipality of Aosta and, among other things, it was also the subject of a special commission session. We read, returning to occupying that process of alienation of the 15 villas in the Cogne district for which the Municipality of Aosta has banned a notice of public enchantment in the spring. As we have repeatedly remembered in this classroom, the goal that the owner tells us remains to identify one or more buyers for those currently touched accommodations and thus guaranteeing the start of the complex renovations they need. As the proposer points out, the first expiry date was set for the presentation of the purchase offers on 28 June and the same was not successful. In the following days, the competent municipal structures had communicated, even in the absence of offers, that they had had a positive response in terms of interest; For this reason, the Municipality of Aosta had decided to extend the effectiveness of the public sales notice by a few months, a notice that was published under the same conditions and setting the new last date for the presentation of purchase offers on 30 September last. As I said and as agreed in the context of a specific motion, in the meantime the Municipality of Aosta has been audited by the competent board commissions, the third and fifth in joint session, to provide information and clarifications on the alienation project. With regard to the announcement expiring on 30 September, the competent offices of the Municipality confirmed that with the new deadline no offer has been received. Further evaluations and insights useful to plan the continuation of the alienation operation are underway at this point."

The municipality said ""one or more buyers"", the announcement was made only for a buyer, a single person who could buy the 15 villas, so it cannot be like this. The extension that then went deserted sanctions what we said: that it is not possible to continue in that direction.

47930,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,2,6354,"The colleague asks us three questions about the situations that have occurred on the regional road number 20 of Gressan, the road of which we have already been several times: it is the subject of a very important and certified traffic also from the passages. With regard to the first two questions (if reports have come to what is reported in the initiative and if, if so, insights have been made to understand the reasons for the critical issues), the attention on that stretch of viability is high, as on the remaining regional roads, but on that in particular. Even with his colleague Lucianaz we often dealt with the regional topic of Gressan, Pont-Suaz, and this response is shared and subject to ... following the comparison with the Municipality of Gressan. In relation to the recent event that happened in a stretch of the regional road number 20 which is placed in the town of the Municipality of Gressan, in the Chevrot hamlet, the competent regional structures have been informed of the incident and the assessments by the regional administration are underway - as I said - in coordination with the municipal administration to identify the possible actions to be taken in order to further improve road safety. Actions that follow those already undertaken, which we will answer in the third question. It should be noted, however, that along the regional road, falling mainly in the inhabited center with a speed limit of 50 km/h, the electronic speed control by the Municipality of Gressan had been activated in order to induce users of the road to respect for speed. The regularly tested equipment had been hired by an external company to which the Municipality had also entrusted the management of sanctions to the highway code relating to speed detection. The automatic speed detection, which began in October 2023, lasted until June. The service then, according to what the Municipality of Gressan communicates to us, provided for the laying of a device that detected in both directions, in four fixed points of the territory, three of which along the regional road number 20 and along the regional road number 40. For the detection of the speed, the presence on site of a local police officer equipped with tablets was necessary, therefore, in total autonomy compared to the company supplier. On the indication of the junta and after sharing with the mayor, the services were carried out at least biseptimanal, sometimes trisettimanal, for an hour of an hour, alternating the time slots with the result of a significant drop/decrease in the speed of vehicles along this stretch of regional road. This is what the Municipality of Gressan tells us. Starting from June, the Municipality had to stop surveys in relation to the entry into force of the interministerial decree of 11 April 2024 which made changes to the rules for the use of speed detectors. Currently, therefore, despite the good results in terms of compliance with the speed limits and therefore of safety detected in recent months, the service is temporarily suspended, pending the regulatory clarifications that have been announced. As for the third question (what are the further actions put in place in synergy with the local administration to make this stretch of road safe), road safety, falling within the legislature program 2020-2025, is one of the issues of attention by our government. It should be noted that the regional public works program 2024-2026 and in progress various maintenance and safety interventions of the road network, which we know have a length of about 500 km. Following the competition, even from Capo Cantoniere, it was possible to restore the six circles - once there were 8 and, due to the deficiencies of staff and retirements, it went down to 5 -; The restoration of the sixth circle also allows the cantonieri garments to have a better monitoring than what is the regional road network going to divide a lower number of kilometers each. The regional road number 20 of Gressan, also taking into account the important vehicular traffic, has been affected in recent years by the realization of different and important interventions aimed at improving road safety. Briefly list the main ones: construction of the roundabout, of which we have already spoken, in the intersection between regional road 40 and 20, then the construction of sidewalks alongside the regional road in the municipalities of Gressan and Jovençan, for a total of 3.5 km, construction of the roundabout between Gressan and Jovençan, construction of the roundabout between regional road 20 and regional 47, as well as pedestrian paths on the Municipality of Aymavilles. Also following these interventions that we have recalled, it is noted, on the safety front, which along the entire section of the regional road 20, for the stretch of travel along the territory of the Municipality of Gressan, is guaranteed the continuity of the sidewalk starting from the border with Charvensod until the entry of the Jovençan roundabout. The sidewalks continue, however - and we know - on the territory of the municipality of Jovençan up to the limit of the inhabited center in La Fournaise. It should also be noted that important interlocutions are underway with the Municipality and with other bearers to regulate access to some commercial areas with the hypothesis of an insertion of a further roundabout in the Borettaz hamlet, which will also allow to limit the speed of the vehicular flows. Finally, it should be noted that, in the current year, maintenance works of the road plan of numerous sections of the regional road 20 of Gressan have been carried out, also in order to improve road safety, as well as - that was another of the objectives - mitigate those that were the noisy emissions with the laying of a bituminous conglomerate at low at low acoustic emission, in implementation of the action plan for the management of the environmental noise of the regional road, which is the object. of the initiative."
47930,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,3920,"Thanks councilor for the answer and for the wealth of details with which it obviously reported what is the state of the area. I believe, however, that a reflection must be done on everything, that is, a series of things that you have rightly mentioned, net of the maintenance that is there, and is right, and therefore it is part of what can be considered the safety of a road section, let's say that the criticality is above all the accident that happened, as well as others that occurred long ago; Unfortunately, they are due to the speed with which that stretch of road is faced. That stretch of road is clearly a stretch that runs precisely in the middle of an inhabited center and that evidently from here draws its danger. What we said is this: if it is true that all these actions have been put on the field, it is clear that they are not decisive and therefore it is clear that there is the need to take further steps. Coming, for example, to the question of detectors who were then temporarily put out of use, as we know, it was a regulatory intervention wanted with the new highway code, to prevent those appliances - in our region they are fortunately limited, but in other areas they proliferate and become ATMs for administrations, more than a traffic control system - do not undergo hyper -fiction, let's call them that. However, what has been reported to us - I think it will have been reported too - compared to the collection of signatures of the residents of the area, is that they were in function of the traffic lights that were then deactivated and probably the traffic lights if - but this is a municipal competence, that's why then inside the initiative we wanted to insert the passage of synergy with the municipal administration - they were probably in operation more deterrence would have been obtained. Unfortunately, what was found today is that we find ourselves dealing with this stretch of accidents in the upper part. What was also discussed with other colleagues is the problem of filling that stretch of road which, in my opinion, concerns another theme, that is, how to make it download, how to avoid overloading that stretch of road that is different. The problem more than anything else is revealed in the night times, in the evening-nocturnal times when the visibility is lower, when traffic is certainly lower if not scarce, but the conditions of curves and little visibility of the road stretches make the crossing clearly dangerous. It is clear that, if we find ourselves having a problem in front of the day where we need to speed up traffic and allow a discharge, and different proposals have been made on this to allow you to connect directly to the state road; From the night front, the early morning the time of the accident, which for only a pure chance has not proved to be mortal, instead there must be a garrison that allows to avoid the repetition of these accidents, that this can be achieved either with the restoration of the traffic light or with an action of greater visibility and therefore the possibility of being able to have a better visibility, also because it seems that the machine that hit the pedestrian would go to about 80 km/h, The houses in the area must certainly not be simple. Having said that, there are several interventions that vary according to the time and therefore how to empty that road on daytime, in the morning or in the afternoon, and how instead to try to be able to dampen the dangers instead on the most evening time and with conditions of less visibility, so I thank you for the insights that she wanted to provide us. Obviously we will now also make a verification compared to what he told us, even with the inhabitants of the area, to understand if these could be solutions that will be able to intervene on the problem."
47931,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,2,6459,"Let's go back with the Baccega colleague to talk about state roads, 26 and 27. Four questions. With the first question, he asks us for the results of the comparison with Anas, if it happened: I confirm that on 18 October a meeting was held with the Heads of the Anas, in which the various themes were tested again, including the topic also relating to the safety of the state of state road 26 of the municipalities of Quart and Saint-Christophe. The meeting was scheduled for a few weeks, previously and, considering the importance of the theme, we confirmed it despite the fact that the work of the Council were also ongoing who extended for an additional day on Friday. However, with going to postpone it, we would have lost the precious weeks and therefore we managed to organize ourselves for this meeting. It was an opportunity to share some design solutions - and the meeting was particularly focused on the question of Quart and Saint -Christophe - that the Anas technicians proposed to us. These solutions obviously require subsequent insights and moments of comparison between all the parties affected by the realization of the interventions, primarily the municipal administrations involved, the stakeholders present in the areas neighboring the state road. An intervention that you, having held this role previously, knows well and knows the problems, knows its urgency, but also the relapse that this intervention will have in the area. New meetings will be calendarized shortly, so I also asked the government's colleagues for the availability, because it is an intervention that has a direction public works, but we know well that involves trade, involves transport, tourism, civil protection and many other actors. New meetings, therefore, necessary to find the synthesis between the parties and identify the best design and construction solutions as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the vehicular flows, without forgetting the need to ensure the travelability and crossing of the road section also affected by pedestrians and cyclists. As I have already said on other previous occasions, the intervention is as urgent as it is delicate, so it is important to proceed carefully, but above all by opening the comparison, especially I think of all the commercial activities that gravitate to that territory. It is a meeting, that of 18, which had a specific focus on this dossier. Already in the next week we will meet again to expand the comparison on other issues. Regarding the second question (when the Focus Anas Valle d'Aosta will be forwarded to the regional councilors, with the relative tables of the interventions that summarize the works planned in the Aosta Valley, the works to be financed and the works already financed?), We are working with Anas in order to be able to have the packaged document. Anas is carrying out an important maintenance of the state roads present in the Valle d'Aosta area, with a view to guaranteeing easier and more secure travel of the same. These maintenance interventions can certainly generate, especially in the summer, with the presence of tourists, some critical situation that we try to face and resolve. Anas and Region, in order to limit these situations of discomfort more and more, are actively collaborating with punctual analyzes of the interventions, their timing and possible solutions aimed at decreasing as much as possible the problems. In this perspective, it is believed that, taking into account the imminent winter suspension of the construction sites, Anas can transmit with the first months of next year a plan that details the interventions to be concluded and the new interventions to be activated, also indicating a time schedule of the works and any limitations to circulation. This plan can be shared in this Council and in the Commission. Tomorrow with a further initiative on a roundabout we will return to the subject. On the third question (if he has foreseen to involve the competent commission for an in -depth examination of the interventions), it will certainly be my care to involve the competent council commission, which I also thank for the continuous and profitable collaboration, on the complex of interventions as on the new project to secure the section of state road 26. On what we had taken a commitment that we have not forgotten and that we obviously intend to maintain as soon as we are in possession of the Anas technicians, after course, sharing. Fourth and final question: if an indication was given to the Anas of the Urgency level that covers the intervention on the state road 26 of the section between Quart and the entry of Aosta. I confirm, also here the evidence that the safety of that section in question is of a priority character for this administration. This priority was shared and reiterated to Anas in the meetings that took place in recent months, last week, and in those who will come, even in the presence of the two administrations involved, who participated in the meeting which was also partly dedicated to municipal administrations. Anas has also recently confirmed that the intervention requires a total investment of 35.65 million euros and is currently included in the Anas Mit 2021-2025 program contract, which has been approved with a prescription and with resolution number 6 of 2024 at the Cipess in the session of March 21, 2024, later then published in the Official Gazette, the general series number 160, on 10 July 2024. Euro 24 million, of which 20 million from the funds for new works and four million from the agreements agreements. I therefore repeat that it has anticipated the opportunity for Anas that, after the sharing and approval of the general design of the intervention, it can be given - as we have already discussed here - priority to some functional excerpts of greater urgency; Among these, in particular, the two roundabouts placed at the traffic light systems of the airport and the motorway junction. So a design that will continue of all the intervention, but then the will, which I believe was also shared, to give a certain priority, a certain urgency, to the two roundabouts."
47931,XVI,06/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,4,967,"This time we have the clearest ideas, in the sense that, as we had already affirmed, the money at the time made available was not enough, we reached a figure of 35 million and broken of resolution 6 of March 21, 2024, right? If I understood well on the fly. The theme is this: that stretch of road is really very dangerous. Still last week two accidents, not fortunately for serious, in the sense that there were no injuries or worse, however, two accidents that somehow slow down the traffic, block the paths, someone goes to work late, others go to school with difficulty. Then there are the new pedestrians, who indiscriminately cross the road and is very dangerous. The two roundabouts are fine, but a minimum of divide deception must be inserted, in this first intervention considered of priority. We wait for this design, we wait to see her in the commission, as she said, but urgently stress this path."
47932,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5171,"We answer the three questions of the interrogation that are: if it is possible that the Italian Ministry of Health has not received the data on the reorganization of the regional beds referred to in the decree in the introduction, and above all if the data have been correctly transmitted. Question n. 2: If the ten beds available in the triangle may be included in that table and if they are currently used. Question n. 3: If there is a way to efficient communication to the Ministry of Health and in general to the entire population, in order to avoid further unpleasant representations on a health level in our region, using the huge PNRR funds made available by numerous programs for the digitalization of Valle d'Aosta health. We confirm that the data published in the aforementioned print article do not correspond to the real situation of the equipment of the beds of intensive and sub-intensive therapies which, overall, are present at our health service. We confirm that the periodic findings provided for by Legislative Decree 34/2020 have always been provided to the Ministry. We inform that interlocutions are underway with the technicians of the Ministry of Health to update the organization plan of the hospital approved with resolution 584/2020, providing for the beds that we have actually increased within it, as has been requested. The Region had been asked, in fact, to achieve an enhancement of additional 10 beds of intensive care and additional 9 beds regarding sub-intensive. Regarding intensive care, 12 beds are available at the Parini hospital at the resuscitation department; These 12 beds can reach up to 22 considering the 10 beds built by the commissioner structure for the health emergency (the so -called triangle) and then then transferred to the USL company from the commissioner structure itself. Therefore, compared to the request for further 10 beds of intensive care, our region has, to date, obtained an increase of 12 beds, including 2 at the resuscitation department and 10 at the triangle. Compared to the request for additional 9 sub-intensive beds, further beds of sub-intensive therapy have been created at the structure adjacent to the pneumology infectious diseases department. Therefore, in fact, our increase was equal to over 105% of what was required by the Ministry. The published data therefore refer to the reorganization plan of the hospital network provided to cope with the pandemic and provided for the construction of a prefabricated, C1, which was to be placed between the withdrawal center and the body C, that is, the current seat of the resuscitation department, and connected with the latter. It is precisely in this sense, as mentioned, that the interlocutions aimed at updating the aforementioned plan are underway, for which we asked and obtained a comparison at the Ministry, convened for November 12th. The press news does not take into account, therefore, the fact that in our region the strengthening of the beds of intensive and sub-intensive therapies took place using the places carried out by the extraordinary commissioner structure for the health emergency. Although this situation has been communicated several times to the Ministry of Health, the same has not been correctly represented in the press reports referred to. In this regard, we inform you that we have further represented to the Minister of Health the particular situation that characterizes our region, asking for an integration of the data disclosed, so that a correct and exhaustive information is guaranteed. On the other hand, it would seem simplistic to think that communications given to the Ministry can guide what freely publish the media. In any case, we share that we have again represented to the Minister - more punctually than we had already had the opportunity to be able to share in the meeting of November 17, 2023 - the fact that it is possible that the data that in general can emerge from the health service of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta cannot emerge in a truthful reality. In this sense, in the meeting of 12, we will try to represent the above again and of course the undersigned rewritten to the Minister of Health. The only positive data, connects Lucianaz, regardless of the fact that she and I have fun telling each other as much as we think, is that, in fact, as regards the intensive and sub-intensive therapy beds, regardless of the printing news that we tried to do in a way they were corrected, however we have obtained 105% of increase, so we went well compared to what we had to do in theory, and this is a positive fact for the community. Unfortunately, public opinion, the press and those who decide to give the data and to those who do not depend on us, even if we try to improve in this sense."

If I can afford, it has slipped a little on the last sentence because ""they do not depend on us"", I would like to see who depends on if the ministry must receive monthly ... I repeat the phrase in the premises of the initiative: ""Every month the regional administrations are required to communicate the data to the Ministry, in order to allow monitoring and the progress of each individual intervention of the program"". That the two IT programs do not communicate may be a fact, I don't blame her, but it is certainly the regional structure that must monthly provide this data to the Ministry. He told me that on 17 he will have a meeting with the Ministry, I hope that, with all the millions that this regional administration is investing in digitization, you find a way to communicate between computers so that the data is correctly reported. The press bodies, in this case, did nothing but spread the updated table of the Undersecretary to Health, Marcello Gemmato, which this autumn has released; So in this case it is the ministry that provided data, this data did not have them, and she today explained us a little for what reason. That the hospital structures have made their duty is sacrosanct, it is peaceful: they have created the places, the therapy is arranged and works, so the problem is not there. The problem - and this is the spirit of initiative - is that the Aosta Valleys are often seen and willingly classified at the bottom of the rankings, we are only above the Molise region that has absolute zero, otherwise we are basically also at this ranking, when instead money, work and commitment are spent to create structures that are precisely carried out. So I pray to his Department, please the regional structures, please those who deal with computer science, to see that they communicate this data directly and correctly. Everything there."
47933,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,4348,"What is the current situation in terms of availability and on -site presence of general practitioners in the territory of the upper Valtournenche, also with reference to the periods of greater tourist influx. The USL company informs that from December 1st (therefore in view of the period of greater tourist influx) in the municipality of Valtournenche the outpatient activity will be guaranteed by a second doctor, in addition to the one already present. More generally, in the context of primary assistance medicine, after years of work, insights and evaluations, on 6 September, in the Regional Committee of General Medici doctors, the regional supplementary agreement concerning the territorial functional aggregations was signed. This is an important agreement, approved and made fully effective - a Copernican revolution, I meant - by the junta with resolution 1160 of 23 September, which lays the foundations for the reorganization of local medicine, also through the organization of work at the future community houses, that is, with what were once called the polymbulators. The discipline is in fact aimed at fully enhancing the skills and professionalism of the primary assistance doctor in his unique role; In fact, alongside the ordinary activity of the family doctor, so -called ""in the cycle of choice"", based on the relationship of trust with the client who chooses his attending doctor, the hourly performance activity is added, aimed at enhancing general assistance in the area, thus guaranteeing an H24 service with what are the community houses, that is, the former polymbulators. Primary assistance doctors, therefore, in addition to continuing their business at the usual clinics, will also be able to provide activities at the Community houses, or polymbulators, where direct access clinics will allow the presence of a doctor who can respond to their health needs: hence the Copernican revolution above, also linked to the fact that the general practitioners of general medicine, in their centrality, will collaborate in staff with a whole other series of figures, health, socio-health and socio-assistance. Coming to the well -known national deficiency of general practitioners, it is important to inform that at our region, in contrast to the national level, we received questions for participation in the competition for specific training in general medicine for all ten places made available and then presented themselves to the exam in eight. Another positive sign is given by the training course ended on 29 October, which saw four internships fully enter to support the Valle d'Aosta regional health service. Of these, three doctors, already appointed with the roof at 1,000 clients, will be able to expand their ceiling to 1,500 clients, thus guaranteeing further spaces of choice for our community. We are certainly aware that these numbers do not yet represent full resolution to the need for family doctors, but it is a positive fact, as it is also demonstrated by the interest shown for the degree course in Nursing that has seen the Aosta Valley, perhaps as the only faculty, with all the thirty available places full. It should also be noted that to guarantee assistance, especially for fragile patients, two direct access clinics are active at the Municipality of Valtournenche, on Tuesday from 10:00 to 13:00, and at the Antey-Saint-André consultancy on Monday from 14:00 to 17:00. Assistance to tourists in the summer period is guaranteed in the Valtournenche Consultorio by four doctors from 15 July to 23 August 2024, which ensure the activity from 8:00 to 14:00, or from 10:00 to 16:00. In the winter, of a greater influx of tourists, assistance is also guaranteed through the activities that are carried out at the traumatological center; Also at the Municipality of Valtournenche, to these services is added the continuity of care, what was once called the medical guard, active on the midweek days in the time slot from 20:00 to 8:00 and on the pre -holiday days and holidays with h24 coverage."

So I believe that shortly we will also have the incarnation of this proposal which, of course, being in some ways innovative, has requested a necessary study by all the subjects deputies, both at the assessor level and in terms of health management. Of course, a project of this kind must be absolutely applauded in terms of ideas, but it must also be joined with what are the availability of professionals, who always remain difficult."

In particular, to ensure compliance with the safety of employees and users, he had introduced the ban on access to bicycles and motorcycles within the hospital perimeter to limit as much as possible the risks of interference, of course with a construction site. As already referred to the Council, the design of the technological plants, therefore basically a piece of phase 3, has provided that the new premises of the G3 body are almost totally buried. Considering that the area is characterized by other plant networks under existing services, before being able to start the works, it was necessary to take further time to carry out the preliminary movements on the electricity and gas networks. Since September 16, the maximum number of bicycles that can stop within the Parini area is expected to be equal to the number of stalls in the fenced area, i.e. 51 bicycles. The stalls are almost entirely positioned in the north-west area, in the corner of via Chaligne and via Paris, where the shelter is already present today with thirty covered stations, except four stations already present in the square near the entrance of the thermal-deplorer power plant. The other stations present and scattered in the area will all be relocated near the shelter, in order to order them in a single area affected by the bicycle parking lot. The entrance of the area must take place with bicycles in hand through the pedestrian access of the users, passing inside the Guardiola, Body A. The route to reach the stalls must follow the internal road to the north side of the Parini hospital. Once you reach the maximum number of bicycles inside, any other bicycles will be addressed to the rainfall parking and outside the fenced perimeter. There are sixty -six other public parking spaces of indoor bike parking that can be used by staff, given the proximity and direct connection with the hospital area, although the same are not reserved for the staff of the USL company. The ban on access to the area remains for motorcycles. These provisions will obviously be updated in the presence of new circumstances that can determine interference with the safety of anyone transits within the hospital perimeter."

First of all, she has basically gave us some time of those who don't understand anything, saying: ""But is it evident, is there a construction site in there, how can you pass with bicycles?"". Note: in the area that you mentioned, that is, where there is the shelter and so on, there has been no construction site anywhere, there has been no construction site, nobody, I pass regularly but also the staff passes through every day and has not seen any construction site. Since, four months after this obligation, she also told us ... When we presented the question, saying: ""It is absurd that you do not afford to park your bicycles in the hospital when there are stalls"", she said to us: ""But what problem is there? There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of parking lots inside the Parini parking lot, so they can be put there"". Then I hope not to disturb her too much with my replica, councilor, and I hope it is not too disturbing if I speak to her ... President is fine, we call, we do, next time I will give the same attention too, do you think it's all normal? Excuse me, if I ask you only a minimum of attention. I will do the same with two phones, maybe I turn around next time when she replies. I said, she told us that there were a lot of parking available, so we were fools who did not understand how, in reality, one could park ourselves. No construction site was done, no passage was allowed, the outer's external fence was filled with bicycles tied with the padlock, because all these hundreds of parking lots that were for the bicycles were evidently not enough, four months later the ban on September 16 is removed. We ask ourselves: ""How come? It will probably be the construction site, the hospital is in place, there will be the new hospital and it was finished"". In reality, I don't read well and see the internal communication of the USL that says: ""As is known, every year the municipality of Aosta adheres to the European Mobility Week"", which will take place knows starting from what day? From September 16, exactly since the regulation has stopped having its functionality, that is, practically until 16 in September inside the hospital you could not park the bicycle, then the European Mobility Week arrives and the regulation is revoked from 16 and you can park the bicycle inside again. Roomly, but it must certainly be almost a coincidence, on 21 September the cycle path of the Municipality of Aosta is inaugurated, but it will certainly have been a coincidence. Then he understands that the employees of the USL are not stupid, they look, with their bicycle they go inside, they have also equipped themselves with these things because the city unfortunately has been made unlivable by the cycle paths, they equip themselves with bicycles, it prevents him from parks them. Then the USL organizes the bicycle week, and the day it starts that week, the regulation is revoked and from this moment you can park, and she now comes to say, councilor, which is actually because: ""Ah no, but the construction site has been secured, so there are places"". Councilor, but we do not make fun of ourselves, do things according to what you want to do, do things according to what is convenient, giving the most absurd motivations. This is a small thing, but it is the small thing that shows that perhaps someone is thinking they can do the good and bad weather. She said that in reality there is a certain part of the structure that does things independently, and it does not seem to us, it seems to us that instead someone perhaps wants to go to a certain direction, it seems to us that someone perhaps has fun to harass the employees and when he is taken in the chestnut, and when they are noted what the problems are, then perhaps he wakes up. However, this is a strange coincidence, councilor, and I hope that it will remain in the documents, and above all that those who made this regulation then retired and saw it revoke it, will know well the nonsense it made."
47935,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,4320,"Question n. 1: What has been the average expenditure of the last five years for the purchase of consumer health material by the AUST Aosta Valley. The USL company has communicated that, relating to the last five years, therefore the period 2019-2023 included, the average expenditure for the purchase of consumer health material was equal to € 8,935.133. More in detail, the average expenditure was equal to € 8,269,216 for 2019; Euro 8,934,097 for 2020; Euro 8,459,369 for 2021; Euro 8,717,358 in 2022; Euro 10,295,623 in 2023, thus also following what are the allocations that are always growing data at our regional health service. Coming to the question n. 2 (what is the procedure and what are the bodies involved in the procedure of purchase choices of the material in question), the procedures inherent in the purchase of the health material, in particular of medical devices, are governed, as you can imagine, by the code of public contracts which, in the 2019-2023 time period, has undergone periodic corrective periodicals, up to the adoption of the current new contract code referred to in Legislative Decree 36/2023, DPCM 24 December 2015 and 11 July 2018. These DPCM, respectively, identify and integrate the product categories of goods and services for which, pursuant to the decree law of 24 April 2014 n. 66, the Bodies of the National Health Service are required to resort to Consip SpA or other aggregators, therefore unique plants of client, in carrying out the relative purchase procedures. Therefore, the USL company uses coded procedures in the programming, design, entrusting and execution activities of the purchase contracts for medical devices, procedures that transversely affect all the administrative and health structures of reference. In this procedure, the USL company is strictly assisted by the commissioning power plants, i.e. from invading Spa in the first place, as a regional reference center and aggregator subject for the product categories referred to in the DPCM mentioned above, and by other national client plants through adhesion to framework agreements, i.e. contractual methods codified for the optimization of purchases. Coming to the question n. 3 (what are the procedures for verifying the post -purchase quality of the material in question), the structures owners of the purchase procedures interface regularly with the health facilities that use the medical devices purchased. The pursuit of the result in purchases in the health sector cannot ignore a continuous comparison between the user part of the property and the part that takes care of the purchase. This comparison is aimed at optimizing the exchange of information relating to both the needs and to the type of use of the goods in question. Any situation of discrepancy between the quality of the purchased asset and the good received is reported to the buying structure by the user structure. This determines the activation of a comparison between the buyer structure and the supplier company, a comparison aimed at resolving any non -compliance of the product. This phase can also determine a replacement of the product not complying with expectations with another product and, where necessary and granted by the contractual legislation, also replacement with a product of another supplier. We also highlight that the structures user of medical devices entertain a constant dialogue with patients and associations of patients, and in this sense it is important to underline that their opinion also, since direct users of the devices, as far as possible, is taken into consideration. This of course applies to all associations, including diabetics. To what is illustrated, for information completeness on the topic, we finally add that the attention on the quality, functionality and above all on the safety of medical devices is also guaranteed by the activity of the network for the device-invigilance that involves the Department, the USL company and the competent contacts of the Ministry of Health in continuous interlocups, comparisons and exchanges of information, always to protect patients and to guarantee care."

Meanwhile, it is important to underline how relevant is the expense, because she told us - now I have taken notes very quickly - an average expenditure of almost 9 million a year, with over 10 million exceeded in 2023, so we talk about truly relevant expenses for the community. As for the purchase procedures, it is clear that there are binding procedures that have administrative procedures that must be observed, so we know of the Consap, we know of these bodies that sometimes proceed to make purchases, through competitions perhaps independently, other times associating to other bodies. The substantial problem is then that of post-purchase control, that is, once the material and the devices come to be applied and used by healthcare professionals, here there is probably some critical issues, because it is true that there will be a device-vigilance network, the fact that she tells us that the various interested parties interface regularly, I do not think it is always so easy to interface with the suppliers when they are of Taiwan. This has already happened, so I think this is a fairly significant problem. What has been reported naturally by medical operators, and not only, is that sometimes these materials are quite poor, and I understand that it is not always a direct responsibility of the bodies that are part of the health company, because in fact, as we said before, there are procedures to be observed, sometimes you join someone else, that I know, that it buys patches or syringes, and then you get your package and take note of what you have arrived. But perhaps, from what has been reported to me, that there is not this immediate reaction, so these verification and continuous interface procedures of which she has spoken to us ... In my opinion, but I say it in a very prudent way, we would miss it, because judging the work of others is always easy, but sometimes we are wrong, but I believe that this procedure could be improved in this respect. However, I reserve the right to return to this point again after doing some insights and carefully read what was his answer."

The aforementioned parking spaces are the places for the disabled at the Via Guido Rey headquarters. The USL company informs that the works for the construction of what will become the community of Aosta, which, as is known, will find financing in the PNRR funds and no need to represent the urgent timing compared to this type of design, is underway at the Poliambulatorio in via Guido Rey. The works, among other things, are aimed at creating a new access to the structure with an operation of the reduction of architectural barriers for all categories of users: disabled, elderly, visually impaired, etc. These activities, which we are aware involve some temporary discomfort - coming to the previous question, the fact that you think I can be so diabolical as to establish the revenue and exits from a construction site such as that of the things of the G3, in some ways it also makes me feel much stronger and more powerful than I am -, they have requested a reorganization of the parking stalls for employees, for employees with disabilities and for users. The current works have in fact significantly reduced the number of internal parking spaces among the corporate buildings in via Guido Rey. The company informs that three dedicated stalls have been made for the disabled user who must access the Poliambulatorio; The other stalls are intended for corporate cars and operators have been sensitized to the correct use of the same. Users in possession of the blue coupon for people with disabilities can also park for free in blue stalls or on the places reserved for the disabled in via Guido Rey. We trust that at the end of the ongoing work can be restored with an exoustive and satisfactory allocation of the parking lots to meet all the needs, from the company to those of the users and, even more so, to those of the users of people with disabilities."

I was one day to go through that street, that is, via Guido Rey, and I am called by a person with disabilities who had to park, and who has actually found the parking lots completely occupied by the Usl machines, however I also published a photograph that testifies it .... I know he knows, but I will also mention the article, do not worry. I take note of this parking lot and therefore take a photograph to testify, because maybe I had not had photography they could also have told me that I invented things, and of course, since there was no regional council, I considered it appropriate to publish everything, so that maybe something was moved. Now imagine my discouragement when I read exactly the things you just told me, that is, the USL replies: ""According to reports from the USL company"", this is the article that was then done following an interview with an explanation request, ""the temporary use of the internal parking, between number 1 and number 3, is reserved exclusively for users and employees with a blue coupon that attests to the disability"" and so far there are three. ""And company cars"". You see, councilor, I understand everything, the needs of the PNRR and you have to finish everything, but she imagines you are a person with disabilities and having a place under the house, where the car park. He arrives and does not find his place, he knows why? Because one who has to move the house has arrived, the van parked us and says: ""Okay, but this is a place for people with disabilities"" and also for vans if you want to move, because unfortunately I urgently urgently do it, so it's not that I can be waiting here. Now it will understand that this explanation of the person with disabilities will certainly not be enough, because it is clear that if a stall has a very precise signal, which is the one reserved for people with disabilities, it is not a stall reserved for the service machines of the USL. The stall is reserved exclusively for people with disabilities. There is no construction site, PNRR or construction site that you want to overcome this rock. The fact that she pervicatively defends the USL line that says that the service machines can park us is simply shameful and revolting, since she deals with the first person of disability. Those who deal with disabilities and tolerates that on places intended exclusively for the disabled people can put the service cars and the USL, and justifies it with urgency motivations, objectively it does not do its job, it does so very bad. So much bad assessor, very bad for the Usl offices that justified her this. Moreover, I also allow myself to say one thing: there are works of the PNRR financed with millions and millions and millions of public money and a person who has put a moment to think: ""Mumble, mumble, but where can we put the machines when this space is busy?"" There was no one, it was thought of quite the opposite, except that where to put the machines and how to allow disabled people and people with disabilities to park. Moreover, people with disabilities are the first who are angry, because they do not find a place and there is a nice saying that you can park with the coupon also on the blue seats; It is true, but it is not located, that's why there is a courtyard with a bar that is reserved for people with disabilities who go there to have health services. Objectively, councilor, this explanation does not satisfy us at all, in my opinion the conduct of the USL and the management of those spaces is absolutely shameful. We remain convinced of this and obviously the question does not end there."
47937,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico, ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5674,"Before answering the questions subject to the questions on the issue brought to attention, we consider it to be a briefly recall to the recent provisions adopted with the decree-law no. 137 of 1 October 2024, containing ""urgent measures to counter the phenomena of violence against health, socio-health and auxiliary assistance and care professionals in the exercise of their functions, as well as of damage to the goods intended for health care"". As is known, with this decree-law some changes have been made, even to the criminal code and that of criminal procedure, and severe penalties have been inserted in the event of damage to health and socio-health structures and in the event of aggressions to the detriment of health personnel. This is to say that the argument of violence and aggression, given the health personnel, is - alas - of great topicality and has a scope that proceeds with provisions to stem, as far as possible, the phenomenon. The problem, therefore, is of a community nature. Coming to the question of the question: n. 1 ""The number of episodes of violence against healthcare professionals at our health facilities in the last year and the places most subject to these episodes"". The number of verbal and physical attacks recorded in the year 2023 at the health facilities of the USL company is increased compared to the annual data detected in the three-year period 2020-2022. Based on the monitoring carried out, the episodes of violence committed at the structures of the USL Company against the operators of the health and socio-health professions in the exercise of their functions in 2023 are in fact 32, compared to the 18-20 annual reports referring to the three-year period mentioned above. The most involved structures are psychiatry, with 25%, the emergency room, with 13%, and the territorial area, with 15%. In relation to the current year, considering the period of processing of the data between 1 January 2024 and 30 September 2024, no. 28 attacks, 14 of which involved the psychiatry department. In the evaluation of the data, the peculiarities, of course, of the users that accesses the Department of Mental Health, must be taken into consideration. As regards, however, the other hospital departments, there is a decrease in the number of reports of the episodes in which they are generally around one or two cases per structure. Coming to the question n. 2, ""The measures adopted at the regional hospital and the local structures"", the USL company, starting from December 2022, has adopted a new company software, called ""Thales"", for the management of clinical risk. With the start of the new IT program and with the campaign of awareness and training of healthcare personnel, there is greater attention from the staff to proceed with the reports. A specific procedure is also operational at the USL The goal is to provide all operators with the necessary indications to recognize verbal and non -verbal behaviors of the aggressive type, in order to prevent tension situations go to degenerate into episodes of violence and, in this sense, are suggested to operators of the measures to reduce the risk of aggression by users and to spread the practice of the immediate use of the reporting tools of any episodes of violence. The staff of the preventive medical structure and Risk Management of the USL company has collaborated with the strategic direction in the revision of the company information contained in an poster positioned in the common areas of the company itself, in order to inform and raise awareness of the possible consequences relating to the gestures of aggression. The Ministerial Recommendation no. 8, i.e. the recommendation to prevent acts of violence against health workers, aimed at preventing acts of violence through the development of measures that allow the elimination or reduction of risk conditions present in the health context, in addition to the acquisition of skills by operators in evaluating and managing these events. Finally, the preventive medicine structure and the risk management of the USL company report that the data mentioned above are related to the reports received through company software. You cannot have knowledge of how many are hesitated in complaints to the police forces. At the Department of Mental Health, a private supervisory service with a cleansing function was activated by the USL company, being structures more at risk for the characteristics related to users of users. At the Emergency Department of the Parini hospital, the police forces are present from Monday to Saturday, from 7 to 13 hours. On holidays and at night the service is covered by supervision on site. Finally, we inform that the competent structure of the Department is working with the USL company to establish at the regional level, pursuant to the current regulations, the Center for the management of the health risk and the patient's safety. In this way, those activities that the Region already carries out in the context of the reconnaissance and communication of risks and adverse events will be formalized and made structural."

From the data that provided us, certainly many of these are linked to users, because, if we talk about the psychiatry department and the emergency room, we most likely be in cases of this type. It would also be interesting to understand how many of those reported cases were in the structure perhaps due to alcoholism or drug addiction phenomena, because perhaps, even from this point of view, it would be interesting to understand the reasons for the aggressions: if linked to pathologies and a specific users or if instead linked to tensions that can be created, perhaps for long expectations or for other reasons. Since the presence of a software has been represented - and I imagine that in that software there are also data of this type - perhaps we will make access to the documents to better understand what the reasons for these attacks are."
47938,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico, ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,12876,"With regard to the outcome of the comparison with the political part, it is to be clarified that the remodeling of the organic plant was naturally adopted independently by the Jean Boniface Festaz, with resolution of the Board of Directors on 13 August, and was then approved by the regional government, with resolution no. 1188 of 30 September last. The redetermination of the organic plant equipment is part of the dutiful process of managing expenses, the process requested by the Region, which the company is pursuing. Compared to the technical assessments that led to the determination and reduction of staff, we report what was reported by the Jean Boniface Festaz. The company recalls that in the previous endowment there was no presence of health services (which were introduced with the modification made by regional law n. 12 of 29 July last) and that in social-health services the employees referred to the professions and operators of health interest assigned to services more of a socio-health nature were assigned in cumulative mode. The number of OSS, which constitutes over 60% of the total employees, was, in its complexity, reduced from 75 to 78 units, identifying the number of operators assigned to each of the three types of services: of the rest home with protected and protected service Plus, socio-health with the temporary residential number dementia and health with the community hospital that is the next opening, whose equipment is indicated in the project of the specific interest between the Region, The USL and Jean Boniface Festaz, shared with trade union organizations and approved with resolution no. 824/2023. Here it is useful to specify that the OSS number has been reduced compared to the previous one operating in the RSA-UP service, in compliance with what is defined in 2023 also with the trade union organizations, compared to the return of the personnel temporarily placed in service at the USL company, pending the completion of the community hospital. J.B. Festoz confirms that he has safeguarded the staff with the equipment indicated in an organic plan in addition to the minimum standards foreseen at national and regional level, with all the permanent employees already employed in the former RSA-UP. In this case it is absolutely useful to inform that, as regards the minutages to the person who are explicit in 120 minutes, the J.B. Festoz is around 170 minutes per patient, therefore very above the minutages provided for by the current legislation, and which also in terms of service rendered, in terms of cost or investment on the people who are at the Jean Boniface Festaz, we are very above the standards of protected and protected regional plus. As regards the dementia unit, in the socio-sanitary OSS service, the OSS equipment indicated is the one currently operating. Compared to the OSS operating in the socio -assistance service of the retirement home - the largest from the employment point of view is 69 beds - the J.B. Festoz explicit in having produced and used the scientific model that is defined as professional care model. The company then emphasizes the application of the model that avoids the substitutions of personnel for absences under 60 days, a measure aimed at containing the expenditure (for which we had made a commitment with our letter on February 20, 2024, to clarify the budget 2024) which, after being introduced as an experiment, entered the definitive form. The modification, however minimal - a resource in the number of OSS overall assigned to the sub -representatives of the retirement home - is essential and functional to guarantee internal replacement without resorting to additional contracts for replacements. This therefore generates does not increase, but reductions in the costs of the staff and minutages paid, however guaranteeing a well -being assistance to the minimum prescribed, which was why I represented this great respond to the minute against the Jean Boniface Festaz, without a significant impact on the quality of the service rendered, thanks to the process of optimization in progress. About the reduction of units in the area of ​​auxiliary services, the same concerns the concierge service which, with the technological modernization of the business telephony, no longer has the fulcrum function of all incoming calls, which are now directed, and will therefore be able to see a more limited time of activity compared to the current, with the consequent economies. With regard to considering the possibility of relocating the OSS staff with limitations in the role of concierge employee, the retirement home reports that there are currently no vacant positions in the concierge service and that the hiring mentioned in the initiative relates to the temporary coverage made necessary in relation to an absence, not short, in person in a permanent service. I now answer the questions inherent in the initiatives of Collega aggravi. Compared to the attempt to conciliate by the unions against the Jean Boniface Festaz, the regional offices of the prefecture services competent in this regard communicated that the same, following the meetings held, had a negative result. As you know, the councilors cannot participate in these conciliations at the Prefecture offices. However, it is useful to specify that as part of the comparison the management of the J.B. Festoz expressed his will to proceed with a competition procedure for taking nurses and which, starting from the year 2025, it will be possible to allocate additional resources for staff replacements. The company has also reported that they will soon be stabilized two of the six vacant Oss Positions on the part of the socio-welfare services, while four other positions are covered by staff hired for an indefinite period, temporarily assigned to the retirement home and which will pass on the future community hospital. Responding about any meetings between the trade union organizations, the retirement home and the regional counterparties, as specified above the social partners and the governance of the retirement home met in the context of the attempt to attempt to conciliate above. Although it is not a direct part in this formal procedure - as it was also further clarified to all those present on the conciliation table - we met the social partners on 29 October, as required by them, considering them useful to clarify the path that led in the last six years to recognize extraordinary resources to the retirement home. I believe, as also attested by the union organizations themselves, that the meeting was also profitable to clarify the important regional commitment made to support the assistance activity of the Jean Boniface Festaz. In fact, it has gone from about 2.7 million euros granted in the year 2018, six years ago, to 5.2 million euros allocated for the current year, only for the socio-assistance part. As regards social and health services, until the end of August 2023 the USL company had two conventions with the J.B. Festoz: one relating to the UPAP service and one for the Alzheimer and dementia nucleus. The first ceased at the end of 2023, when the work for the construction of the community hospital were started, while the second is still effective. For the RSA UAP service, the Usl company provided the J.B. Festoz approximately 1.5 million per year, for the Alzheimer and dementia nucleus the expense committed by the USL company is equal to around 300,000 euros per year. In light of the financial difficulties communicated by J.B. In the year of the revision of the regional law 34/2004, Festaz, already started by the two departments of the Department, was necessary to intervene urgently and priority on article 12, concerning the assets of the financing sources. The need to update the financing rule of the J.B. Festoz was explicit in the Regional Council Resolution 346/2024 of approval of the Triennale Budget 2024-2026 of the Festaz and in the resolution of the Regional Council n. 624 of 3 June 2024 of approval of the Budget 2023 of the J.B. Festoz. In these documents, it was known that the revision of 34/2004 was underway and that, in the context of this review, it was expected to change the financing mechanism, in order to ensure adequate additional financial resources also to the socio-health services provided by the company. Therefore, these changes were made in the first variation of the budget 2024-2026 approved by this Council. More precisely, in analogy to the interventions already effective for socio-welfare services, a sharing of the operating costs relating to health services (future community hospital) and socio-health (dementia nucleus), in the maximum extent of 35% of their amount, has been introduced. This contribution, financed with regional resources, will be provided by the USL company in the context of the contractual agreements in place with the J.B. structure Festoz. The approved measures provide for a maximum financial commitment in the regional budget of € 400,000 for the year 2024 and 1,300,000 euros for 2025 and 2026. Also regarding social -health services, it is important to add that, in parallel with the contribution interventions on operating costs - first with article 5 of the regional law 27/2023 and subsequently with article 22, paragraph 3, letter i) of the regional law 25/2024 - specifics have been provided for extraordinary refreshment measures in favor of the providers of the accredited private social and health services. These measures, financed with regional funds and provided to the managers of services by the USL company in the context of existing conventions, have the purpose of contributing to the major charges determined by the general increase in operating costs, including the costs for the next rounds of contract renewal. In this sense, to J.B. Festoz was paid by the USL company an amount equal to € 79,354. In the same way, the general provisions will be approved to proceed with the liquidation of the refreshment also for the 2024 exercise. As made evident by the numbers, the intervention was enormous and unprecedented. Connect aggravs, you are a person who not only pays attention to numbers, but also has the memory of the numbers. After such an articulated answer, there is certainly a need for a small synthesis. From a political point of view, this Council and the Government in the last 18 months have made Jean Boniface Festaz an intervention which, from a socio-welfare point of view, has seen, both for 2022 and for 2023, the maximum expenditure made available; With the intervention made with the law 12/2024, however, for the first time it intervened in a classification of the staff, in a clear and distinct way, compared to health and socio-health functions. This, as just highlighted, will go to financial interventions on 2024 of 400,000 euros and 2025 and 2026 of 1,300,000 euros. To those 5.2 million euros we talked about, which were only 2.7 million in 2018, these expenses will also be added. From this we remove the interventions that have been made in an extraordinary way for the contractual renewals and the interventions that you have asked for in terms of investment, for example as regards the 500,000 euros allocated for the famous water conduct. At this moment, therefore, which made evident also by the right questions that have come from the trade union parties, this advice is also the government, both in the action put in place by my predecessor, colleague Barmasse, then continued by the undersigned, we arrived, in socio-assistance terms, to allocate the maximum possible, with an extraordinary contribution to the extent of 1,600,000 euros. The capital shares went from 115-125 euros each to the current 130-140, therefore the sum of these capital shares was also found to be, at this moment, as high as possible; All this without predicting transfers for the socio-health part. Having also changed the 34/2004 and having institutionalized the fact that in that structure, which has the minutages among the highest in the Aosta Valley, for each person who is assisted there is also a health coverage that in other parts is not there and having also planned a financial allocation, which is what I have just recalled, I believe that we can all say that surely the effort made for the Festoz is a concrete effort and that has already happened."

Unfortunately, being two inspection initiatives to be discussed together, it's up to interrupt it. Obviously I thank you for your reply, net of an error that she made when she talked about a reduction ranging from 75 to 78 units, perhaps she was on the contrary, from 78 to 75. She said this, first, I would just like to ask for confirmation that it was only an error. Obviously I thank you for your reply, which substantially downloads the critical issues on the reduction of staff on the choice of J.B. Festoz, so he tells us that you have simply acknowledged the request arrived from the structure. It is clear that in the question we had presented we also asked for the outcome of the comparison with the political part; She says that the comparison with the political part is not foreseen, but in reality there has been, because we know it, and we also know of the irritation of the unions that has been in discovering this cut. If we were to summarize a little the sense of the response that you have provided, we could say that everything has been done in a workmanlike manner, that the minutes are obviously even superior, that we have an exceptional treatment and that therefore almost that staff was in addition. Then she motivated this cut with an economic need, due to the critical issues that the structure reports from this point of view. I limit myself to observing the fact that, in our opinion, the solutions to be adopted could be different, with everything that I think they will have duly informed - if they have not informed it, I inform you - that a person who worked in the structure since 2012 yesterday resigned. This can only highlight that problems in the structure are there, that the critical issues between those who work are unfortunately warned and that a climate of this type does not certainly help to carry out their task, which unfortunately requires a lot of attention, with the necessary serenity. Compared to the suggestion of placing OSS staff in the concierge functions, it also tells us that that is a fixed -term contract, for an absence that will be quite long. I believe that, rather than depriving yourself of staff, perhaps the choice to place people at another function ... because it is not clear: she said that we have now computerized, so we no longer pass from the concierge, but then the need to have a person on concierge is again, so it is not clear which of the two actually is the thing that goes most. We take note with regret of the situation that has been created, above all because, if people who work in that structure for tens of years have come to do actions like those of resignation, probably there are problems. Our concern is that in reality these critical issues and these tensions do not unload on users, unfortunately, that, in the end, all this are absolutely innocent. We therefore urge it to pay more attention in the choices that will then be carried out than the structure, then we take note of its response and wait for the evolution of events. Above all, we will confront the staff to evaluate what the subsequent steps will be to be taken."

We are happy that she too, connects Manfrin, when he hears the sirens of the unions appears. Welcome to the club. Having said that, in the face of the contingent situation - and I certainly don't want to criticize the size of the commitment that the administration is putting towards the nursing home - I would like to return instead a little back. I also mentioned the other previous councilors, if I forgot someone I apologize, I excluded the interims because it is objectively every now and then it is complex. Having said that, there are two big problems related to that reality, which I already tried to explain in a very modest way before even the theme of the community hospital was born. There is a problem of financial structure - in fact the interventions that the commissioner spoke are today an attempt to solve a problem that actually does not arise today, but which was born previously - and on the other hand a problem of organizational level. I allow me to take a consideration made by the man of the street: certainly the high minutage compared to the other realities is a good and right thing, or it could be, because the man of the street could say that there is a higher minutage because there is a higher organizational need than other realities, therefore the organizational problem persists. The cooling and conciliation procedure is a plastic representation of the organizational problem, as I think there may also be an additional problem - and in part it had already emerged in all the initiatives that the various colleagues have made - in the sense that those who are no longer at Festaz, and have been moved, do not want to return to the Festaz, so we have an additional problem and we know very well what the complicated area was to move, human resources elsewhere. We therefore have a further problem and the weight of the replacements is there. The fact that with new funds you can then carry out a procedure to increase the organic plant, among other things approved by the USL company, is a further run for cover. The two problems, therefore, actually persist. On the part of the financial structure surely the synthesis - and thank you for the synthesis she has made - allows you to understand what the commitment committed is committed, which loads the governance of the nursing home of a further and greater responsibility and perhaps, as one would say in the industrial economy, it is better to focus on the line, rather than on the administrative or on the administrative ones, and it is obviously also necessary to decrease the stress that is in the organizational area, which can then be downloaded or can be downloaded on a better quality of the Service, service that has however been, as often we rightly remember, always of quality. Now we have also learned that there will be an additional union assembly. What we hope is that there can be, on the one hand, a resolution of this high temperature, given that the procedure is of cooling, but that, beyond the individual procedures provided for by the laws governing union relations, there may be an internal, organizational cooling, above all useful to have a resolution, perhaps not definitive, but which allows everyone to work more effectively and more cohesively. We hope then that there can also be a definition of the procedure relating to the executive body, therefore also to the General Management, in such a way as to better understand how management will be managed. Certainly, unfortunately, it will not be the last initiative, but it is a set of initiatives, which I think may also appreciate the consistency and attempt to solve problems.

With reference to the first question, or if the competent councilor is aware of the bonus in question, the answer is affirmative. It is a tariff concession for domestic customers aimed at reducing the expenditure incurred for the supply of electricity of the families in which there is a component that is in conditions of physical unease and that requires electromedical equipment for maintenance in life. The matter is governed by the decree of the Ministry of Economic Development no. 28 of December 2007, which provides, in article 4, that the customer in possession of the requirements provided for in the previous article present a specific request to the Municipality of residence. The Municipality of residence, also through the IT support made available by the Ministry of Economic Development, assesses and admits the applications, upon presentation of the certificate issued by the local health company to which they belong, certifying the serious health conditions of one of the members of the family unit, such as to require, in fact, the use of the medical-therapeutic equipment necessary for their existence in life and powered by electricity. As reported above and as reported also clearly on the institutional site of the Arera, the competence to receive the questions is therefore of the municipalities of residence and not of the Region, which does not even have, as written in the question, any function of collector of applications, having no access to the IT system for the transmission of the same. For the submission of applications, the Municipalities can also subscribe to an onerous agreement with the tax assistance centers (CAF), by virtue of an agreement signed specifically between the ANCI (National Association of Italian Municipalities) and the National Consultation of the CAF. In the text of the question, reference is made to questions that would have been refused by the municipalities of residence of the interested parties and the CAF, but without further details, which would have allowed a direct verification with the identified municipalities. With any good account, in a collaborative perspective, the offices of the social policies department have activated a comparison with Celva, receiving reassurances on the fact that it is actually a competence of the municipalities of residence of the interested parties and that Celva itself will send a note to all the municipalities, remembering the ownership of this procedure, naturally by copying the Department itself. The same offices of the social policy department then also activated an informal comparison with a CAF, receiving as a response that the CAF actually are authorized to receive and transmission applications for this measure, however, as mentioned above, the stipulation with the municipalities concerned of an agreement in this sense."

I want to highlight that, hearing his answer, someone could imagine that some competence has been charged to the Region; In reality, this is what unfortunately some municipalities have answered, that is, some municipalities have rejected the responsibility for receiving questions in part to the CAF, in part of the Region. It was not understood therefore, since the indications are very clear on the Arera website, why there was not precisely the choice to collect these questions. I thank you above all for the part of awareness that has been put in place with Celva and at this point we hope that the responsibilities between local authorities and, possibly, CAF or regional administration, because in this way the procedure will also be clear, therefore we can also communicate to families - unfortunately there are several dozen those that have communicated this problem to us - that the question is solved. She rightly said that we have not indicated the Municipality: we did it deliberately because, as you know, the censorship that this advice often applies is very serious - someone yearns it - but if we had also inserted more precise coordinates to identify which administrations they had not provided adequate answers, they had not taken over the questions, we would have risked unleashing ""then it is that person, it is that other, we discuss in a secret way"". So we cut the head to the bull and only highlighted a situation of discomfort that, I imagine, with the communication that announced us will evidently be overcome. Thank you for your reply."

This law also expanded the allowance to all healthcare personnel, including that of regional law 22/2022, also with a part -time employment relationship. The total financial burden for the three-year period 2023-2025 was determined in € 2.7 million, according to the counts provided by the USL company. The USL company has therefore started the company's supplementary bargaining, establishing, in accordance with the trade union organizations, to provide the beneficiary staff with the same monthly amounts referred to in regional law 22/2022, instead of, of course, the amounts proposed precisely by its bill, n. 65, which in fact instead provided that the lower amounts were paid compared to 22/2022. The amounts of the bill no. 65 So - in a political bargaining that she saw, colleague remain, and the government, to get for these employees to find an absolutely profitable solution - had naturally been calibrated with respect to the above amounts. The trade union organizations actually agreed to proceed with, however, to a adjustment by the end of the year, if it was necessary to comply with the total amount of the loan approved in law, which was precisely 2.7 million euros. In recent months the company is therefore proceeding with the expected adjustments. It is therefore not a reduction in the temporary health allowance for lack of funds, but of an ordinary accounting operation provided for in the context of the trade union agreements that have been signed in the company, connected to a adjustment procedure. In a nutshell, when between the trade union representatives and the company it was then to apply, at a expected office, to the application according to the amounts of 27/2023, in fact it was expected that there would be possibly adjustments if by the end of the year the money would have been more or less; always within the maximum limit of 2.7 million. Before proceeding with the answers to the individual points of interrogation, it is good to specify that the data provided concern the categories of workers contemplated by law 27/2023, which therefore exclude the staff hired for a fixed -term, doctors and full -time nurses. We come to question no. 1, ""How many new hires are carried out by the USL company of the Aosta Valley during 2024, referring to non -medical health management and health professions excluded nursing ones"". The new hires carried out by the USL company during 2024, until the month of October, referring to non -medical health management, were equal to 3, while those referring to the health professions, excluding the nursing one, were equal to 2. The cessations recorded by the USL company in the course of 2024, up to the month of October, referred to the non -medical health management, were equal to 2, while those referring to the professions health, excluding the nursing one, were equal to 13. ""If before proceeding with the adjustment there were interlocutions with the company"". The adjustment was carried out without predicting the interlocutions between the Region and the USL company, as these are not foreseen, but established exclusively in the context of the company's supplementary bargaining with the trade union organizations, for which also what she reported during the discussion of the Defr had absolute relevance compared to what happened, but of course all this did not refer to what had been established at the moment in which the 27/2023 had been applied, where Compared to the fact that it would take place by the end of the year. This amount was at the time defined on the basis, in fact, of the data provided by the competent structures of the USL company, precisely in the context of the supplementary company agreements stipulated with the trade union organizations, both of the healthcare sector and of the management of the health area. It has been agreed that the provision of the indemnity took place through the recognition of the amounts established provisionally, therefore respectively in Euro 350 and in Euro 800; This, without prejudice to the redetermination of the same by December of each year, to ensure compliance with the spending constraint. To protect everyone, compared to the right nervousness that there may be from colleagues, the commitment that the government already takes in 2025 is to go to increase the allocation on 2025 of 27/2023, also thanks to the reports that have arrived."

Everything else used it to explain to us in great detail and to summarize the situation. This question is preparatory to the discussion of the motion - which I hope will be discussed today - to which you have already given part in part, saying that the commitment of the junta is to finance what is missing for 2025. So I think we will have the opportunity to appreciate the vote in favor of this motion. Having said that, it allows me only one note: the proposed law on the indemnities was from 2022, I tell her the date, spring 2022. We waited for a year because the majority defined all the procedures to get to recognize this allowance, dutiful for the health personnel. The calculations that had been made at the time, in May, were completely different. Having said that, we appreciated that in bargaining the unions have come to define a different figure. This was the bargaining, evidently something did not work, or the reduction was already expected. However, we will have the opportunity to confront each other at the time of the discussion of the motion. For now thank you for all these data, we take note of the number of terminations and the number of hires, which will be very useful for (incomprehensible)."
47941,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SOCIALE,en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5914,"""What are the technical reasons why the Democratic Party for the assignment of the assignment for the drafting of a feasibility study aimed at the participatory review of the regional interventions of the policies in contrast of gender -based violence does not include any indication relating to the fight against discrimination on gender identity and sexual orientation?""? Question 2: ""If you have been entrusted for this specific theme another study and with what indications"". The question 3: ""Otherwise, if he confirms that the bill that should be ready for the summer 2025 will also include rules for the fight against discrimination on gender identity and sexual orientation"". The question 4: ""If the delivery date of the aforementioned study can be anticipated"". As already mentioned several times in this classroom and as well as he also detected, starting from last August the process of reviewing Law 4/2013 has started operationally, which sees the feasibility study necessary. Responding to the first question, a summary and generalized phrase was used in the managerial measure, which therefore does not drop in detail. We confirm that the study, as we have asked, will contain prevention, contrast and support interventions, in favor of women victims of violence, with or without minor children, and of those who suffer violence and/or are discriminated against and persecuted by virtue of their gender identity and their sexual orientation. These are these important aspects that we share must be taken into consideration and which we believe to understand in the future framework law, as we have already stated several times in this classroom. Responding to the second question, it goes without saying that no other assignment has been entrusted to another subject, as the theme is already, as mentioned, included in the wider assignment mentioned above. Regarding the third question, it is confirmed once again that the new text of the standard will also include what recalled, or any form of violence, which must be condemned. Compared to the date of delivery of the study, we must keep in mind that the same - built in an participatory way through the involvement of various entities, subjects and actors in the area - requires the congruous times already envisaged. In any case, it will ensure attention to the methodological process and - even if the presentation of the new rule before the summer of 2025 is not considered possible to date - it will be done everything possible to anticipate it. The times of sharing with the deputies - colleague, you can easily understand it - they cannot be imposed, because otherwise their participation would actually be less. In fact, with a executive and imposed approach, the method that these times rightly impose, given the sensitivity of the theme of which we are talking would be questioned in this way. We do not want to make it angry and reopen a whole series of themes again, but we must understand each other: if we apply the time variable to processes of a methodological and participatory nature, or we impose them and therefore subtract the methodological part, or, as she rightly said, if we let us run, at that point our intent could be to extend them. I understand perfectly, so I absolutely did not have a paternalistic attitude, I could not afford it towards him, I simply call the final part of the previous discussion: fifteen days ago, on this theme, she in a very clear way highlighted that I was making it angry compared to this theme. This is the reason why, I say it right away, I am dwelling in this part of the process. I am absolutely not intended to limit it the possibility of getting angry with me, I can also understand it, however, coming to the more technical and more procedural aspects, the fact that in August, as among other things we also exchanged informally, the mandate was given to this study which is the subject of the interrogation in point n. 58 of this agenda of the regional council is absolutely not a process or to extend the times, nor to narrow them. It is simply that, if you want to get to the establishment of a framework law, the reference process, which, among other things, has also come from the territory and which also incorporates with respect to an articulated national legislation, which is not giving particular indications on this issue ... If you want to take into consideration, from a methodological point of view, a participated system, an administrative path that is practically not crushing, at national level the foot on the accelerator, it is necessary, consequently, to find a right interlocking between respect for a method that must take into consideration the solicitations of the territory and the time necessary to make sure that, rightly, nobody can think - because this is not the case - that we are trying to slow down these times, indeed. The choice (which was made by the Department, even before the undersigned came, and then from the undersigned, together with the V Commission and also together with your legitimate stresses on this issue) makes it clear that there is absolutely attention. I am not going to make anyone angry and I have not even intended to get angry when I am used as a bogey of the one who wants to slow down these regulatory processes, because this is not the case. When choosing, also in respectful terms, of the administrative dictates of the shared administration, that a decree-law has well identified by the Italian state, I believe that in fact those sharing times must be respected, because I believe that the territory must participate in giving indications on such important issues to give adequate solutions."
47941,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SOCIALE,en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,3924,"Councilor, the question arises from a very simple situation: in the last council session she had told us that it was your intention to bring the revision of the law in the summer of 2025, when we are at the final jokes of this legislature, and then he had told us that an assignment had been given. I searched for this managerial measure of the month of August and I must say that, when I read it, my bewilderment, which was already evident in the classroom, has increased, because in the text there is no reference to the part linked to discrimination for gender orientation. Now she tells me that the phrase is summarized and generalized, but the phrase is this: ""A study aimed at the participatory review of the regional interventions of the policies in contrast of gender violence"". There is nothing else. She says that it takes the right times, that it takes a participated process and that we must not impose gears in forced stages to the associations and to all those who want to make their contribution. I, councilor, I remind you that the other time I talked to her of three years because I was referring to the path of the legislature, but we remain to the period in which this department is led by her, so from March 2023, if I am not mistaken: in May 2023, so we are talking about about a year and five months ago, we have been summoned, given that a year had already passed since the deposit of our bill, from the Department and we were said to have the intention to see The law, the revision of the law was underway and would have been placed, in that review, also for the rules that we asked then. Now the assignment for the study has been given in August 2024 and she says it takes times. I understood that the times are needed, but we know that this review has been underway, at least this is the right date, since May 2023. Then the years increase, the months have not increased, the years increase. Consequently, from May 2023 - when we are communicated that we are making the revision of Law 4/2013, to arrive today, and then to arrive in August 2025 - over two years will have passed. The fact that the process of participation of the associations requires such a long time - and then obviously it is not only the time of participation of the associations, but also of the editorial staff of the study - it seems not to want to slow down the times, I do not say that she slows down the times, what I tell you is that she does not accelerate the times, surely they are not accelerated. This is under everyone's eyes. I also believe, I know, that the associations that intend to participate in this path do not need to develop special and specific requests, because they do not know reality, they know it very well and know that there is a need to go on quickly. What proves it - the need also comes from reality - is that the situation in the Aosta Valley, I speak of gender -based violence, has worsened, therefore requires, also from the legislative side, not only by that of the police, a commitment, which must be supplementary for what concerns the times. The other question concerns discrimination for gender orientation, which are not mentioned in the managerial measure. I accept what she says, she confirmed that this thing will also be included in the law. I notice that he has not talked about inhabitants, therefore it means that then this will not return, while we had understood that he had to return. I seem to have caught, at the end of his intervention, an willingness to try to push for the times to be shorter. I sincerely hope it is. Then on the fact of getting angry, councilor, perhaps she should worry that I do not get angry because, being the councilor for health, if then I get a nice cuddler on the health system too."
47942,XVI,07/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,2,2334,"Let's go back to talking about poker at the Casino di Saint-Vincent. In June we had asked the junta to understand if it was the intention of the gambling house, as other game houses in Italy already do - I speak above all of Sanremo, which was the first, but now also champion - proceed with the organization of poker tournaments also in Saint -Vincent. Aware that these tournaments do not bring the so -called spending customers closer to the gambling house, but that somehow promote entrances to the gambling house and in any case feed revenues, even if they are not so significant, and still create a strong increase in recesses to the induced, that is, hotels, restaurants and above all for the trade generally in the area. Also and above all on the basis of what was discussed in the last municipal council of Saint-Vincent, where it was underlined that the country's trade is in trouble, so also applies to Châtillon, and the convening of a monothematic advice on the crisis of the trade in the area was requested. The recovery of the casino is certainly a positive element, especially to us it is very pleased, but events and events of calls are required that go far beyond the day alone. We had news of an assignment for the organization of new initiatives and new events. I have news that the first appointment that was organized, dedicated to the music of the Beatles, has had great success, therefore the recovery, in tune with the gambling house and the territory, can and must go above all in that direction. Poker tournaments are certainly a call and a positive element that recalls from 3,000 to 6,000 people, this is conclated. Since the participatory company has sent an adequate procedure to present an expression of interest to the organization of the poker tournaments in Saint-Vincent; highlighted that the deadline for the presentation of the demonstrations of interest expired on September 30th; Having no news, we ask the government if the government appears that three demonstrations of interest have been presented - we read it from the newspaper Game News - and in what times it is understood to proceed with the conduct of the management of the organization of the tournaments as well as when you can start the first poker tournament in Saint -Vincent."
47942,XVI,07/11/2024,CASA DA GIOCO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,3634,"Regarding the first question, on information of the gambling house it is confirmed that the candidates presented are three and that the corporate bodies have already made a first evaluation. The company implements, in these cases, the provisions of the current purchasing regulation which provides, in the case of a public notice of the selection of the supplier, that it is carried out through the establishment of an evaluation commission, made up of at least three members. At the end of the works, the Commission defines the list of candidates admitted with a qualitative evaluation and to deliver it to the company management, for the possible notice of the two diligence, technical and economic, and the subsequent commercial negotiation, which will include the analysis of the applications submitted (both from a formal and merit point of view) and the identification of the contractual scheme and the operational project. In this specific case, this project will subsequently be the subject of information to the regional administration for the assessments inherent in the specification that regulates the relations between the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta and the Casino de la Vallée. As for the second question, ""in what times we intend to proceed with the assignment of the management of the organization of the tournaments"", always the gambling house informs us that the times to proceed with the assignment of the management and organization of the tournaments are not currently predictable. Moreover, a company has been the victim of a very serious escape of news that led the magazine Game News to publish, on 2 October 2024, reserved news compared to the position of the three candidates presents of the application and to express merit assessments on the same applications. It is underlined that the deadline for submitting the application was set for September 30 and that before the publication of the news article News, the commission responsible for the analysis of the applications had not yet gathered for the evaluation of the same and that therefore the relevant documents should not have been in the availability of any employee of the company. The gambling house has opened an internal investigation, aimed at clarifying the events and, in any case, will cancel the procedure, evaluating the methods and terms of the new expression of interest. The facts described are also the reflection of manifestations, on this issue, of an uncomfortable attention, media and beyond, which interferes with the autonomy of the company and which weakens the decision -making skills, consequently also delaying the start of the new projects. As for the third question, ""when you can give the first poker poker tournament in Saint-Vincent"", the start of the poker tournaments will therefore depend on the conclusion of the identification procedure of the supplier and the analysis of the subsequent organizational problems. It is worth remembering, as already said, that, despite having an interest on the topic of poker tournaments, the Casino de la Vallée company has not yet committed itself to their organization because it has significant costs of start and commercial investment, has not been included in the industrial plan approved as part of the agreed procedure in progress. In this regard, it should be remembered that, pursuant to the Council of State, section III, n. 2973, of 17 May 2018, the organization of poker tournaments cannot be entirely entrusted to a third party, staying for the company, the management and control charges, for the management of payments and registration of the participants, naturally with the relative costs."

The other element of his response is extremely worrying and I invite you to get us information. I stop here compared to the reply because it does not deserve anything else, but it is absolutely worrying and the hope is that the gambling house can have the information suitable as soon as possible to ensure that this path can restart in the maximum of the possible rules."
47943,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Finaosta",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,2,7035,"To introduce this interpellation I will start from the guidelines containing the application discipline of law no. 20 in the matter of investee, adopted with resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022 It is a ruling of the section of the autonomies of the Court of Auditors of 2021 Legislative 165/2001. I quote this step because then I will return to the final part, hoping to have time, given what I have to try to represent. Finaosta has adopted and actually applied the provisions of the consolidated text, as well as of law no. 20 and, of course, on the basis of these guidelines has adopted a regulation for the recruitment of the staff, always in consideration of the guidelines relating to 14 December 2022. In the face of this, the guidelines tend, precisely, to indicate the need for the investee companies to equip themselves with these regulations. In the same guidelines, in point C, as part of the selective procedures for the recruitment of the managerial profile, it is said: ""The selective procedures for the recruitment of the managerial staff are always open"" - in full respect of the Tusp - ""without any possibility of carrying out vertical career progressions, framing in a higher qualification towards the managerial area, due to the different applicable discipline, in particular deriving from the different level of contraction, different qualification than the immediately below area "". Simplific: Manager against the manager, nothing here. But there is another step that we must consider: point H of the same guidelines, ""assumption of the general manager"", where expected, of course. ""By reason of the peculiar high professionalism and activities carried out by the General Manager"" - which, in the field of Finaosta, I remember, does not undermine only to the Tusp, but also to the regulation of the address of the Bank of Italy, much more stringent - ""of management and company organization, as well as for the necessary relationship between this and the government body of the company"" - the general manager himself in the financials is an executive body, which has a very particular relationship and is not only at the head of of the organization, but is a further special manager - ""companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Region must establish"" - always in reference to the Tusp - ""that the general manager is hired with a fixed -term contract"". It is then said, within this point, and I will only stop on the first words, that ""in the context of an open ordinary procedure the procedure is external"". It is true that in point B there are exceptional procedures, but it is said: ""In the way completely exceptional with respect to the ordinary procedure, the possibility of the companies controlled to proceed, through the assignment of the general manager to an internal manager deemed in possession of the requirements provided for the assignment itself, in compliance with the provisions dictated by the collective contracts applicable, the board of directors is given to provide the board of administration is required to provide adequate motivation for the possession of the requirements the assignment of the assignment. There is a fact, and arrival at the point: in the face of these guidelines, the staff recruitment regulation has been adopted. At the top there is the Constitution, then there is 165, with the Tusp, then there are the guidelines that the Region, the shareholder, gives to its investeee, then there is the statute of the company and then there are the regulations. It is an increasingly stringent sort of funnel. As part of the regulation of the recruitment of the staff, it is said: ""The company, on the basis of the needs of the staff and the hiring plan approved by the Board of Directors for the identification of the profile sought, carries out a prior verification about the possibility of drawing on validity rankings. If this is not possible, or the verification returns negative results, the company activates a specific selective procedure "". But not only, in the final part of the regulation it is said:"" without prejudice to the discipline of the national collective agreement of reference, for the hypotheses of assignment of higher duties, for the coverage of non -managerial work positions "" - therefore all the non -managerial human knowledge -"" Created from the noverse of those made of vacant "" - ""It can carry out special internal progression procedures, and discipline"". to proceed with an internal progression for the replacement of the resigning general manager ""; ""What other internal progressions will have run following the rotation to the General Management, or in the context of the so -called organizational solutions cited by the press release of Finaosta, as part of the declarations made to the announcement of the resignation of the General Manager""; ""If in the context of the choice made by the company, as mentioned precisely in the previous point, there have been interlocutions with the same and, if positive, with which results and, if negative, for what reason they were not started"" and ""if the president of the Region considers the choice made by the Board of Directors of the Finaosta company to be shared to replace the general manager with an internal progression procedure, compared to the methods chosen at the time for the appointment of the resignation"". I do not want the president of it, but the delegation to the investeee is, after all, to the actual owner of the whole regional administration."
47943,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Finaosta",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,6020,"The regulatory examination has already made the colleague, I will just answer the questions that have been asked. Moreover, I believe that those of duty has made their decisions and evaluations on the basis of current regulations, of this I am confident. As for the first question, that is ""what are the reasons that led the regional financial company to proceed with an internal progression for the replacement of the director General Resigned"", Finaosta informs how, relatively to point 1, the motivation on the basis of the identification of an internal resource for the purposes of the rotation of the General Manager lies in the fact that this resource, in addition to possessing all the requirements required for the position in question, was able mature a high degree of knowledge of corporate processes and dynamics, as well as resources in the staff. The same, in addition, in carrying out the government activity in the business area of ​​the company, confirmed full alignment with the strategic corporate addresses. These elements represent an important added value, clearly not found in external candidates, which are also the needs of guaranteeing immediate continuity to the work of the company. In point 2: ""What other internal progressions will have run following the closer of the General Management, or in the context of the so -called organizational solutions cited by the President of Finaosta S.p.A. as part of the declarations made to the announcement of the resignation of the General Manager"". With regard to point 2, Finaosta highlights how the rotation of the General Management will be accompanied by the Institution, to the direct report of the General Management and with replacement powers of the same, of a coordination management of the so -called ""staff division"", including the organizational units that are not directly involved in the credit process and the obligations relating to the administration, accounting, finance, supervisory reports and management control, Direct reporting of the directions referred to in the previous point, of 2 further directions: on the one hand the management of the government, ""Services and studies"", with the function of supervision of the operations relating to the human resources function, the organization function, to the information systems service, the study and advisory service service, of new constitution, to the COA service, to the legal service, to the general affairs, to the regional regulatory consultancy service, to the Data Protection Office, an internal referent; On the other hand, the ""Participations"" Management, with the function of supervision of the operations relating to the Participations Office and the Strategic Consulting Service. The approved organizational solution - in addition to ensuring that company operation can continue without continuity - aims to pursue two main objectives, considered fundamental for the maintenance of current performance levels over time, both qualitative and quantitative. The first translates into identifying a top management ready immediately to take on the company's operational guide, with full alignment to the strategic addresses identified by the shareholder and the Board of Directors, so much to guarantee the maintenance of the directions identified, in order to achieve the objectives assigned to Finaosta in terms of positioning and development of the services rendered for the benefit of the regional socio-economic fabric. The second, accessory to the first, but not of less importance, leverages the time factor. To achieve medium-long term strategic objectives, it was considered necessary to identify resources that from work experience can guarantee a solid and lasting guide of the company. Finally, it is highlighted, and more generally, how the solution is placed as appropriate alignment of the structure to the main canons of corporate organization, which suggest that the same, where possible, takes into account an adequate allocation of the responsibilities attributed to the summit operating bodies. The identification of three new managerial figures replies so much, which will not only be operationally operating in support of the General Management. As for the third question, that is ""if in the context of the choice made by the company, as mentioned in the previous point, there have been interlocutions with the same, in the positive case with which results and if negative for what reason they were started"", it is confirmed that, since it is a reorganization with a strategic marked value, the organizational solution was previously brought to the attention of the shareholder, who confirmed full confidence in the administrative body of the company. For the fourth question, ""if the President of the Region considers the choice made by the Board of Directors of Finaosta to replace the General Manager with an internal progression procedure compared to the method chosen at the time for the appointment of the resigning"", the fourth question appears almost asked at the level of personal curiosity, or as a sort of liking analysis. I can safely respond that the correct and effective confrontation with the presidency of Finaosta ended with a full and wider trust in the fact that the choice had to be an unquestioned expression of the President of the Financial and his Board of Directors. However, if I have to express a judgment, it finds it my full sharing and appreciation in guaranteeing, first of all, a full and immediate operational continuity, that other options would not have guaranteed. This must be added to the personal esteem for the person in charge that, however much I have had the opportunity to appreciate and as much as my evaluation, however not due, may be worth, is a serious, motivated, passionate person, as well as technically prepared and competent."

You can liquidate the last question as personal curiosity, it is certainly an uncomfortable question, but those who have great responsibilities sometimes have to answer uncomfortable questions. In reality it was much simpler: why previously a selection was made and today not? Above all, I ask myself a question ... I say it because the other time it was she, President, so I evaluated this, there was no another person. This question was asked, I received the answer, that's okay, I take note of it. The fact is this: in the answer two aspects were represented. One I summarize it like this: she rightly said that the top management had to be ready immediately to respect the objectives assigned by the Region Member and then also made a matter of timing. Very well, however, I tell myself one thing, in a provocative way: how can a reality be promptly active in responding to the objectives assigned by the Region Member, if it does not respect the directives that the Region Member has given it, with a resolution still valid, until proven otherwise, but above all not respecting its internal regulation. Why is this: often investee companies - even rightly, especially for those who have a private organization - complain about the great bureaucracy of the governance that the region makes on them, but if a regulation is adopted by the same company, why is it not respected? The real problem is not all the discussion that I previously made on regulatory sources, but it is simple, two lines! The regulation of Finaosta, which I still appear to be valid, says an even clearer thing. Excluding a whole series of possibilities, why has it not been respected? It does not even provide for the emergency solution, this regulation, which instead is possibly prepared in the guidelines. This is the absurd. I do not turn the question about people, because I could also say that on some occasions of the external selections they did not allow the participation of internal resources, which during the life of Finaosta grew up and could bring their experience and the work they had already done. Instead they were unable to participate in those selections, because in the announcement it was foreseen, among other things for positions lower than that of the role of the general manager. I repeat: I did not write it, this regulation, the regional administration did not write it, wrote the Finaosta. So I tell myself: how can it be said that there has been the need to have a prompt response to respect the objectives assigned by the Region Member, if a participatory company in house, that is, an arm of the administration, does not respect the regulations that has been given? I am worried."
47944,XVI,07/11/2024,"AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE, Ordinamento degli uffici e del personale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,7925,"As President Textlin will remember well, we had already addressed this theme some session ago. This theme had emerged in all its virulence when some unions, together with numerous political acronyms, which I think they never existed in history - I think they are the acronyms made up of a single person, probably - they had published a flyer, on the intranet dedicated to employees of the region, against differentiated autonomy. This had already made it possible to make a whole series of political assessments on the merits. A particularly questionable phrase had also been inserted on this flyer, where it had been stated that ""to say no to differentiated autonomy meant defending the constitution born from anti -fascism as a struggle and as a value that the fascists today in the government want to dismantle"". If the differentiated autonomy will also give us the possibility, possibly, in the face of the opening of a table, to expand the possibilities for our region, probably, president, it will be a little fascist too. If there is the possibility to modify our special statute also, it will probably be a little fascist too. Maybe he will have to pay attention and look at his shoulders from the unions, but we'll see what the path will be - regardless, this is sure. The question is that we had found him extremely bad taste, so much so that a series of disputes had come out and, in the face of these disputes, the unions, in the middle, had then removed this manifesto to replace him with another national team. I then presented an interpellation on this issue. The curious and fun thing is that - in the face of my request to have greater sensitivity, greater attention than what was published - she had responded in an absolutely shareable way, saying that it would then sensitize the structures, that the structures had already raised awareness for a more centered use of the trade union bulletin board. I imagine the bewilderment when I see that the same union, the main signature that had signed this manifesto, then makes a press release against my interpellation and publishes it on the union bulletin board. We asked to raise awareness to put on the union bulletin board only those communications that have union inherence and the union makes a press release and, instead of sending him to the newspapers, publishes him on the Intranet bulletin board, to respond to my interpellation. My interpellation is everything except union, of course, but it is a political inspection act. Here we can absolutely exclude the fact that it is centered. The funniest thing, however, is that on the one hand the union provides an excuse to remove this flyer, saying that the press release on the bulletin board had a ""natural publication course"" and the natural course is that they published it, they realized that they had made a castroneria and canceled it. That was the natural course, this thing was therefore deceased, but they say that it was a natural course because they organized it, but recall, regarding the possibility of publishing these documents on the union bulletin board, article 1 of law no. 300 of May 20, 1970, otherwise known as the statute of workers - still in force, we know - which establishes the freedom of manifestation of thought in compliance with the constitutional principles. Basically they claim the right to publish what he wants. In reality, in the citation of this article of the workers' statute, a piece is missing, because it actually wrote in article 1 that ""workers, without distinction of political, trade union and religious opinions, have the right, in the places where they lend their work, to freely manifest their thoughts in compliance with the principles of the Constitution"", but then there is another piece: ""... and the rules of this law"". Because the workers' statute also has a series of rules. What do the rules of this law say on the right to be able to publish something on the trade union bulletin board? In Article 25 of the same law we find the right of posting, which says: ""The corporate trade union representatives have the right to place on special spaces, which the employer has the obligation to prepare in places accessible to all workers within the production unit, publications, texts and press releases inherent in subjects of union interest and work"", not the universe world, the human knowledge, Nonna: texts and press releases inherent in subjects of union interest and work. Let's start by saying that I am not a public or regional employee, yet I have access to everything that has been published because the regional employees - there are also some who are not on the left, or are not unionists - are particularly annoyed for the continuous publication of these things, so rightly they rightly give us the right information, and it must be said that we can actually say everything, but we cannot say that a press release sent to respond to the underwriter and the underwriter Work. Mine is a political inspection initiative, the response of a union is absolutely legitimate if transmitted to the newspapers, but putting it on the intranet bulletin board of employees ... objectively it does not deal with any trade union labor. In addition to this, however, imagine the further bewilderment when, always the same unions - not minimally touched by the fact that perhaps that tool is not the most suitable for dealing with a certain type of topics - they think they publish this beautiful flyer against the ""security"" bill, to announce a nice garrison. In this flyer the signatures appear again, as well as of some unions, also of the National Partisan Association - is fine, I look at his colleague Guichardaz, who has just passed - of the Italian Communist Party, of the Communist Refoundation, of Valle d'Aosta Open - about his colleague Guichardaz, who parades behind us - and another theme who is too small to identify, but I imagine that it is more or less than the same. riverbed. It is always red, it has red and white writings, maybe I will ask the colleague to interpret them. I objectively see this as a sense of impunity, indeed, even almost scarring, of dialing, with respect to the rules that themselves, that the unions themselves cite within their press release, made to respond to the undersigned - I repeat: it is very free to do so, I do not mind it in the least - which however does not respect the provisions that the law provides. I believe that someone, perhaps convinced that what is done with certain political activities, that is, cloak in ""apoliticalization"", of ""non -partisanism"", of associations, a political action - because this is: a political action - has thought that the smart one can be done by publishing their political communications on the employee wall box. I still add a chapter. If the bulletin board were something that can be consulted in a special way, that is, I do not see anything, if I do not go specifically to see the union bulletin board, it would not be fine, but it would be all in all less serious; But the problem is that this bulletin board appears just when you enter your intranet, of the employee, is the first thing that appears to you. If I want to go to see something, I inevitably be attracted to this. This is why with this interpellation, president, I ask you if it is intentioned to prepare a regulation to regulate the publication of communications on the intranet bulletin board of employees, in accordance with what I have mentioned, or article 25 of law no. 300 of 20 May 1970."
47944,XVI,07/11/2024,"AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE, Ordinamento degli uffici e del personale",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,4256,"I start with a joke, in the sense that if, after a month, the auspices that we had formulated have fallen in vain from both sides, it is not that there was then that big sharing. In short, we are here again to talk about it, it is our work and we do it with the correctness of all time. It is also mentioned in the interpellation, I remember how much Article 25 of the Workers' Statute states: ""The corporate trade union representatives have the right to place on special spaces that the employer has the obligation to prepare in places accessible to all workers within the production unit, publications, texts, communications inherent in subjects of trade union and work""; It will probably be able to consider that it is an excess of democracy, but there are some significant words within this dictation, which say ""right to post"" and ""obligation to prepare"". The rule is that. As already mentioned in the last occasion, the employer, the region in the specific case, is obliged to make a space available, which today has become virtual and releases access credentials verified to those who work on this space, as we had already said last time. He is not responsible for the published contents, since it is a material formed and managed by third parties, nor can it unilaterally prevent or remove the published material. He asks for the interpellation ""if you intend to prepare a regulation to regulate the publication of communications on this bulletin board"". Having the certainty that the interpellation does not mean ""disciplinary"" as a synonym of ""censoring"", because it would not be possible, while a regulation in this area should be agreed with the same trade union organizations. Secondly, some regulations on the subject were examined, available on the Net, and what appears evident is that substantially these are declarations of principle, which resume the statute of workers, collective agreements and the framework agreements, always underlining the appearance already recalled, that is, that the responsibility for the contents is totally for the subjects authorized to insert. More generally, the liability is not referred to in relation to the contents of what is published, but as regards the possible violation of the legislative decree 82/2005 (i.e. the digital administration code) and the legislative decree 196/2003 (i.e. the code regarding the protection of personal data). The only other significant provisions then concern the prohibition of using the bulletin board for personal purposes and the fixation of temporal terms, generally between 60 and 90 days, after which the texts must be removed, if they do not remove them before. There is no provision aimed at identifying what is of union and work interest, given that everything would be very questionable and this could be considered a limitation not justified to the right of posting. These, therefore, are the parameters within which a possible regulation of the use of the union bulletin board of the Intranet website of the Region should operate. However, I will ask the personnel department to start this reasoning with trade union organizations, despite having some doubts that this responds to the overall expectations of the inter -apellance, because it will probably not be decisive of what is required. I conclude with two small reflections. The first is that it is possible that, thanks to this interpellation, the union bulletin board of the Intranet page of the regional site has had an increase in consultation and will certainly be of interest for trade union organizations. The second is that the opportunities to view texts and documents such as the stigmatized one by the interpellation in the current virtual society are now many and so that it is at least doubting that the political opinion of the regional employees forms through the Intranet bulletin board, which, however, as she also pointed out, for a simple statistical fact also access people who do not share what they support from the flyer, who have a vision opposite to what perhaps the flyer himself. would like to mean."

It is a positive part because surely with this a reflection opens. President, you have rightly said, I don't know if ironically or more seriously, which obviously with this is not understood to censor anyone's opinion. This I would like to claim it, as I have already had the opportunity to say on the occasion of the discussion of the motion of PCP colleagues: I am a careful defender of article 21 of our Constitution which, even more than the workers' statute, guarantees freedom of expression. As you will remember, however, and as some interventions, always in that discussion, recalled, also remembered colleague Perron, what unfortunately we must always keep in mind is what you can do or what you cannot do in public spaces, that is, guaranteed by everyone. Nobody wants to censor what is published, on one side or the other. I am sure, president, that if a non -left union will publish a manifesto tomorrow, for example, on the garrison for the victory of President Trump yesterday, alerting a garrison with all the signatures, with the signatures of the center -right parties below, some left -wing unions most likely something to say would have it. I could add all the possible reasons, but it is clear that that would be a classic example of communication that has nothing to do with work. Here it is not under discussion whether to censor or not censor someone, here it is in question how to use the spaces that are of everyone. It is right what you said, that is, that with social media today the communication has multiplied and therefore that there is no difficulty in accessing the information, this is very true, but precisely for this reason this strengthens our idea that public spaces - we are talking about the union bulletin board, we talk about public spaces such as the citadel of young people, who has been the scene of some events in these days - must have a profound respect and a profound political labor. Nobody can use spaces to bend, on one side or the other, your narrative. Each has its own channels, everyone has the faculty and the possibility of saying what he believes most appropriate, outside the channels that are paid with everyone's money, therefore this faculty must be guaranteed, but must be limited and must not be exploited, instead, a public channel like the one that has been exploited. Everything can be said but, I repeat, what has been done is a sorting of communications on trade union matters that I believe can be trivially starting from a press release. This is a press release that does not care about a political inspection initiative. It is a press release that evidently did not have the right to be published. But I don't care if it was published or not, on the contrary, if the union in question had made a press release and sent it to the newspapers, I would have exhibited it as a medal. Is this far left union against me? Very well, it means that I am in the right direction. Publishing things of this type on everyone's union bulletin board, however ... evidently is not union, this must be reiterated. We will therefore wait that there are the results of this verification, of this in -depth analysis that you have announced us, and we hope that this may be a way to overcome this distorted use of the tools, which instead should be made available to workers and their representatives for the right reflections with respect to the subject of work and with respect to union matter, which is absolutely necessary, useful and above all that supports workers who do not do politics."

As we know, a new law has been approved. In this new law there were amendments, including one of our group, which affected the possibility of accessing the competition, which was drastically limited by the latter law, because it went from 32 to 26 years, receiving, as we have been said, the national legislation. Not receiving the national legislation, however, we remain on the age of 38, instead of 37, as regards the voluntary police. We represented, within the debate on this law, the fact that there was a lack linked precisely to the people who in 2012 had not been able to participate in the competition because too much young and now they will not be able to participate in the competition because they are too old. We also remember the serious statements of the president, whose clarifications are still waiting for, or at least a public excuse; If it has revised and resentful what he said, that it may also be a reason for a possible request for apologies today, otherwise we will surely talk about it in the next regional council. In this sense, the president also pointed out that I had not done the counts well, and I confirm it, because my request for access to the documents came after I presented the amendments, so it is not that I did not have the counts, but I had not been able to provide for the counts. Now I have them too. What we ask is: to understand the number of members and candidates suitable for the competition for the recruitment of the 2012 Fire Brigade Forestry Corps between 26 and 29 years old, i.e. the age group that would be excluded from this new competition; The reasons for which 38 years were maintained compared to national legislation, because, if the goal is to align with national legislation, we ask why 38 years have been maintained for voluntary staff; If you are evaluating to change the standard, in order to allow those who have not been able to participate in the 2012 competition to be able to participate in the next."

The candidates enrolled in the 2012 competition between 26 and 29 years old, or born from 9 August 1983 to 8 August 1986 were 93; The candidates suitable between 26 and 29 years were then 12. ""The reasons for which 38 years were maintained as an access requirement for voluntary staff"": considering that the difference with respect to the state limit was only one year, it was considered to maintain the registry age provided for by regional law 37/2009, slightly more extensive, to encourage the participation of the volunteer firefighters. ""If you are evaluating to change the rules, in order to allow those who have not been able to participate in the 2012 competition to register"". Honestly, it will perhaps be our limit, but it becomes difficult to understand the meaning of this question, net that the law has just been approved. In any case, the 2012 competition closed its path, the next competition will have the rules envisaged, with the participation requirements indicated in the new rule."

However we are talking about 93 people and 12 suitable ones. Compared to the 64 suitable, we are talking more or less than 53%. We sincerely believe that, from this point of view, an explanation could be given. In addition, to help you in the answer to the next interpellation, I can tell you that the amendment we had actually built was built badly because, as she rightly said, it could be participated having turned 18 to the date of August 10. By putting the vintages as we had indicated in that amendment, we would still have excluded a whole part, both from 1994 and 1998, because actually, then analyzing the documentation that came to me, I was able to ascertain that in this sense it could be expanded. I am pleased to hear that the rules, once approved, cannot be changed in these subjects. I want to make two examples: we are in 2010, in May 2010 the discipline for access to the staff of the Forestry Corps was voted, where first degree secondary school is expected and in July 2010, they do not pass even six months, this is modified and returned to the average license. This is a coincidence. Let's go back to a more recent case: the municipal secretaries. Let's go to make a omnibus that, as we have said, creates problems and difficulties compared to the recruitment, we go to see the variation of the budget, which we should approve from here shortly, and we also change the rules there. When you want, the rules can be changed. The guys who are in the vintages 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are 4,000, we are excluding the possibility for 4,000 boys. Of course, not all of them want to be a firefighter, we would miss these 4,000 guys, perhaps a small percentage could be there, we are excluding the possibility for those guys to be able to participate today, after not having been able to participate then; Furthermore, to not be able to participate in the national competition, because this could be the observation, because here in the Aosta Valley we still have the average license, while at national level there is the first grade secondary school. If this is not a total discrimination, I wonder what we are talking about."
47946,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,7200,"This interpellation returns to the question of great relevance of the procedure in mode used for the appointments of the administrators and the board of statutory auditors of CVA EOS S.r.l., a question that we had already raised with a question discussed in the Council on 22 May. On that occasion we had highlighted that in our opinion, in our opinion, the provisions of regional law 20/2016 had not been respected. Following that discussion, on 31 May the President of CVA had written to the President of the Region, to the President of the Regional Council, to the President of Finaosta and to the undersigned, as proposing the question, complaining of a distorted interpretation of the regional law. Letter that then ended with a pressing request, to the Region and Finaosta, to publicly clarify the controversial aspects. To correctly frame the story, it should be remembered that CVA EOS S.r.l. It is a company totally controlled by CVA S.p.A. And that, for the appointments of its administrative and trade union bodies, the same rules provided for CVA S.p.A must be applied. The regional law, as we have repeatedly highlighted, in fact states that the rules on the procedure for appointments apply to the Valdostana delle Acque and its subsidiaries. Despite this provision of the law, the same procedures have not applied in the designations of the administrative bodies of the two companies. For CVA S.p.A. The public evidence procedure was performed, while for CVA EOS this did not happen. This is not only a formal, but substantial question, because the diversity of procedures has allowed an abnormal situation to be determined. In fact, as emerged in the discussion of the interrogation of 22 May 2024, to manage CVA, a CEO was appointed with an all -inclusive annual salary of 50,000 euros, while to manage CVA EOS the same CEO was appointed by recognizing the words of the President of the Region, a compensation of € 300,000 for the words of the President of the Region for each social sector. This is in the documents. I also add that we received a report according to which in the Shareholders' Meeting of CVA EOS, on 14 October, the distribution of prizes to administrators and members of the board of statutory auditors for about 600,000 euros was decided, of which approximately 200,000 would have gone to the CEO. It is something that we will check, then asking for the minutes. What does it currently occur? That a CEO, selected through a public announcement that provided for an annual compensation of 50,000 euros all -inclusive, is found in 2024 to receive, overall, of the emoluments that reach about 550,000 euros, perhaps even beyond. It seems to me that in all this there is something anomalous, or in any case not entirely clear. Cva defends and justifies the procedure followed for the appointments of CVA EOS. In the letter of 31 May, the President considered an expression of an interpretative misunderstanding our statements, arguing that PCP had not kept in due consideration what was stated in the guidelines containing the application discipline of law 20/2016, those guidelines approved with Council resolution no. 1591 in December 2022. A resolution that in fact, in our opinion, made different statements compared to the law. In the aforementioned letter of the President of CVA, at a certain point an evident concern is also manifested about the level of adequacy of the examination of the problem of the appointment procedures by Finaosta and the Region, up to hypothesize, absurdly, an united inattention by the region and Finaosta. We do not know if it was unheard of inattention or a choice, however, on our part we can only reiterate what is clearly written in the regional law, as well as underlining that an interpretation given with an incout the Council resolution cannot exceed what was established by a law. This is what we thought, however, not having enough competence, we wanted to deepen the matter, acquiring on the subject a pro veritate opinion, which we will make available, which was drawn up by Professor Caruso, a university professor of corporate law. What have we asked Professor Caruso? We formulated this question: ""Regarding the application of the procedure for the designations of the members of the corporate bodies of CVA and its subsidiaries, there is a discrepancy between what was stated by article 2-bis of the regional law 20/2016? This is what was said in the guidelines for the application of the law, approved with resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022. We therefore ask to know if for the designations of the corporate bodies of the companies set up and controlled by CVA, the same procedures provided for by the regional law for the designations of CVA S.p.A. must be followed. ""The conclusion of Professor Caruso ... is there an articulated opinion, however in essence, at the end of the analyzes, what did he tell us?"" The discipline dictated by article 2-bis, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 of the regional law of 20/2016. Appointment of the administration and control bodies of companies with regional participation CVA S.p.A. and to the companies controlled by the same. Any contrast between the regional law and the implementing guidelines of the same law must be resolved by affirming the prevalence of the legislative discipline "". The question is very relevant, also because it does not concern only the two companies that I have mentioned, but also many others, for which CVA concern is clearly understandable and the request of the president to have clarifications. In fact, that letter of May 31 sent to the regional authorities and in Finaosta, he closed to have a public answer to have a public. On the issues made. and its subsidiaries. I would add that after the presentation of the interpellation, filed on October 25, we learned - reading the report of the assembly of the shareholders of Cva S.p.A., obtained through access to the documents - that Finaosta, in the person of the then president Nicola Rosset, has in fact sent a response on 5 July 2024. We do not know what it was replied, we asked for a copy on October 28, It was received. Certainly, however, the president of the Region can report on its content, because Finaosta replied. As we do not know, as we do not know if the Region also replied. Obviously then there is also the second question, on which we wait for answers."
47946,XVI,07/11/2024,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,8467,"Before providing answers to the questions asked, I emphasize how multiple clarifications have already been made on the matter over the past two years, specifically with regard to the regional designation discipline of regional representatives on the objective scope of application of the regional legislation. Furthermore, it seems appropriate to dwell on the tones of the initiative, completely disrespectful of the work of the offices of the Presidency, competent on the procedures for the appointment and designation of the investee companies. Asking for explanations on the work of the offices is completely legitimate - and on the other hand the council initiatives are aimed - another thing is to attack the offices stigmatizing, in the absence of any contradictory, the unheard of inattention or, even much more serious affirmation, because it presupposes a voluntary and conscious behavior - the meditated choice of not respecting the regulatory dictation. All this on the basis of the conclusions resigned by an external consultant, in an opinion rendered to the councilor, to the evidence, in the face of his interpretative doubt about the applicable legislation of which the offices have never been placed separately. Even in the face of this information deficiency on an issue that must be examined only and only from a legal point of view, without attributing licenses to inherent or bad faith, the accusations made to the offices with the interpellation are therefore extremely unjustified and completely pretentious. As regards the questions, however, I provide a examination developed by the competent offices, which indicate - how the regional law 20/2016 states, in article 1, paragraph 1 -bis - that ""the provisions of this law do not apply to the controlled company Aosta Factor S.p.A., nor to the company controlled company Valdostana delle Acque -Compagnie Valdôtaine des Eaux S.p.A. With the exception of article 2-bis, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and article 4 and of article 5, paragraph 3, relating to the ascertainment of the knowledge of the French language, as part of the procedures for hiring non-managerial staff of Article 6 and Article 9 If this is the general rule - referring to the scope of application and the individual provisions referred to in article 1, to which it is necessary to refer to how much and to those who depend on the provisions - in the case of the designation procedure and regional appointment the reference is in article 2 -bis of the regional law no. 20 which, in paragraph 2, establishes that ""Finaosta appoints the members of the administrative and control bodies of indirect and detained companies in the context of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, n. 7"". It is therefore to this provision that it is necessary to refer to to understand what are the companies with regional indirect participation in which the administrators are appointed, upon designation by the regional council, to the outcome of the procedure governed by paragraphs 3 to 6 of the same article 2-bis: in this provision, as mentioned, the reference is above all to the concept of appointment: ""Finaosta S.p.A. appoints the members of the control bodies"" indirect and detained as part of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, n. The progressive and multi -subjective formation procedure (as it also involves the Region), launched by Finaosta - in paragraph 3, with the publication of a public notice for the search for applications which ends with a designation resolution sent by the Region to Finaosta S.p.A. For the purposes of the appointment - it is a procedure reported by the law to the companies in which Finaosta is a partner on behalf of the Region and in which, as a shareholder, he exercises, according to the ordinary civil discipline, the power of appointment in the assembly of administrators and other corporate bodies. Following the resolution of designation of the regional council, Finaosta therefore provides to exercise its shareholders' prerogatives, ensuring that the designation of the Region actually translates into the subsequent appointment of the subjects identified by the public body, without prejudice to that (finding an application - as established in article 2, paragraph 3, of the regional law 20/2016 - the current state legislation) the competence to formalize this appointment only and only to the assembly. What is governed by Article 2 -bis is therefore the designation and appointment procedure of which the subjects involved are respectively and necessarily region and Finaosta: Region, as an entity that designates, and Finaosta, as an entity that proposes the appointment in the assembly, but -according to the discipline of the civil code, not derogable by regional law -, Finaosta can produce the appointment only in the assemblies in which it is the title of participating, partner; From this it follows that the designation procedure referred to in article 2-bis, as also specified expressly from paragraph 2 of the same article, concerns only the procedure in which Finaosta is the owner of shares in the context of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, n. 7 For these appointments, straight from the ordinary codicistic discipline of the company, therefore the two-phase procedure (regional designation and appointment of Finaosta) governed by article 2-bis of the regional law 20/2016, as said, as mentioned, to the cases in which in the controlled companies the shareholder is Finaosta, therefore CVA S.p. It can exercise any nomination power. Considering this the right reading of the provisions of the regional law 20/2016, it is clear that - unlike what is proposed in the part of opinion reported in the interpellation - there is no contrast between the regional law and the implementation resolution, which correctly and in application of the legislative device states that the regional law of 14 November 2016, n. 20, finds application against Aosta Factor S.p.A. and Aosta Valley of the Acque S.p.A. and its subsidiaries, exclusively as regards the procedure for the appointment of regional representatives within the participatory companies, indirectly, through Finaosta S.p.A .. specific, in this regard, which pursuant to the combined provisions of article 2-bis of the regional law n. 20, which explicit reference to the role of Finaosta S.p.A., as the owner of the participations in the context of the interventions of the special management referred to in article 6 of the regional law of 16 March 2006, n. 7, with Article 1 in comment, the designation procedure referred to in Article 2-bis does not find applications against Aosta Factor S.p.A., as participation is held exclusively in the context of ordinary management referred to in Article 5 of the regional law 7/2006, and for the participations in companies controlled directly by CVA. It is therefore up to Finaosta S.p.A. and in Cva S.p.A. - as a direct shareholder of Aosta Factor S.p.A. and of the companies controlled by CVA itself - the proposal to appoint the members of the corporate bodies in the said companies. With what has been said and thanking the offices for the work they have provided, I hope to have clarified the doubts expressed and I repeat that one account is to express and want to deepen interpretative doubts with the help of opinions and external advice, other is to accuse the offices of ignorance or bad faith, whose task, however, is precisely to ensure compliance with the law and the correctness of the administrative work."

The phrase that has been reported, which I also made explicit in the illustration of the inter -apellance, is a phrase that used the president Cantamessa in the letter that wrote to her, to me, to the President Bertin and the President of Finaosta on May 31, in which it is said that, if the interpretation was correct, - and we believe that it can be correct -, this would imply an unprecedented carelessness by the offices of the Region and offices of Finaosta. We do not accuse anyone, if anything it is someone else who has overshadowed this question. I must say that it is very interesting to read the minutes, which we have acquired with access to the documents, and the positions that emerge from Finaosta and Cva. It is interesting because I believe that, on the other hand, on that occasion the representative of Finaosta tried to understand a little better how this question worked and perhaps also created some discomfort in the people who were listening to it, given the report of that report that, clearly, being a fairly aseptic report, I think it was also made a little softer than what I imagined was discussed. On the rest, president, given that you has pitted a legal treaty, or an opinion, I ask you for the courtesy to be able to receive a written copy of the answer, because evidently I am not able to remember, article by article, what is in the legal provisions, and I refer to 20/2016 as well as to the resolution relating to the guidelines. However, I note that she did not answer the first of my questions, that is, she did not tell me if the region and Finaosta - then I know about Finaosta because I read the minutes and I know that on 5 July the president Rosset wrote to CVA - did not tell me if the region responded to that letter. For the skills I can have, but precisely because then, being very scarce, I asked for advice, I made my answer when I received the material, when I had the opportunity to understand a little better, and this opinion that we have obviously acquired we will make it available to everyone, also because they are assignments of consultancy that are provided thanks to the possibility of having the contributions to the groups, so they are public denarii that are spent, as far as we are used to give. We, but could also be useful to others. I ask you, however, President, to provide me with the answer so that I can fully analyze what you told me. As for what concerns, however, the opinion that we have acquired and that in essence confirms the prevalence of the law with respect to a resolution of the junta, which also cites the guidelines, I must say that the law - you said it at the beginning of your explanation - excludes Aosta Factor and CVA and its controlled by a whole series of obligations, but not those concerning article 2 -bis, in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the law of the law, Appointments and transparency of the appointments is contained in this article and in these paragraphs.

47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,2,2629,"With the month of September this year, the new university center of the University of Valle d'Aosta was wished, with a headquarters in the center, performing for Valley students. There is about a thousand students who attend university and we all know how chronic the lack of parking spaces is in the city of Aosta, especially in that area. For guys attending university in Valle d'Aosta it is a significant problem, because it is difficult to use public transport. At this moment there is no train that works, the morphology of our territory, the lateral valleys, those who come from outside Aosta ... are all situations that put in difficulty and therefore almost force the boys to get to Aosta with the personal vehicle, with a car. It is also necessary to take into consideration the fact that many of these kids also work, make jobs and also have commitments of care of elderly people in the family, so it is also difficult to spend the day at the university and then still having to try to reconcile the use of public transport with times and coincidences. It is out of doubt that we often speak in this advice to encourage study, to encourage children's school path, to increase their skills and the level of training. This is a priority that we have looking to the future, so that the boys can then draw a life path that is rewarding compared to expectations. At this moment, in which there are not even the parking lots available to the building, these guys obviously park in the stalls that are in the area, which are all of blue areas, so they also spend a lot of parking money in order to get to Aosta and attend the university. For this reason we have proposed this initiative aimed at trying to find a solution, because either it is made available and the possibility of having sustainable parking lots for this category, which is a fragile category, which often does not produce ... clearly we cannot affect the Municipality of Aosta, which is the manager of the stalls, and therefore if you want to go in that direction, the Region would have to make available to the Municipality of Aosta of the resources to cover the missing revenues; Otherwise you should find solutions, such as having parking spaces outside and having shuttles that put the parking lot with the university in quick connection, because this is an additional load which means, in concrete terms, a few hundred cars that arrive in that area daily."
47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,4086,"Thank you, connect, for asking the issue of parking for the use of the University. As you reported, the project of the University of Valle d'Aosta has provided for over 100 places available to staff and students, which, as you know, was not foreseen for the university when it was placed in the old location; And, as she knows, until last year the students organized themselves differently: either with public transport or parking elsewhere. Today the parking lot, which is an attractor, as she detects, a sort of extra atout, is being completed. Throughout the short streets we contacted SIV, the concessionary company of the construction of the new headquarters, which confirmed that the works will be completed within the current month of November. This is to reassure and comfort both her and those who listen to us. Soon it can be used, I imagine in ways regulated by the university itself, given that the university has about a thousand subscribers. It will be necessary that the University somehow makes a regulation of use. However, I want to report, as a good account and also for the benefit of the people who listen to us, that the regional administration, precisely through the structures for colleague Bertschy, has established a series of tariff concessions for public transport for students of the University. For residents in Valle d'Aosta there is a local public transport subscription on bus that can be used on the entire regional network of Autolinee, at a cost of 20 euros per month, without limitations of daily runs and the monthly subscription discounted by 60% on rail transport, which is temporarily carried out through a replacement service with bus, without limitation of daily runs. For non -residents in Valle d'Aosta - since she also quoted a sort of attractiveness towards students who come from outside - the subscription to local public transport on bus, which can be used on the entire regional network of Autolinee, also in their case costs 20 euros per month, without limitation of daily runs. A subscription was made, therefore, that it favors both residents and non-residents, with the possibility of asking the regional administration, for non-residents, the reimbursement of 60% of the cost incurred for the purchase of the monthly rail transport subscription, now substitute, on the Aosta-Turin section. This is to say that, however, also from the point of view of transport, one tried to cope with this problem of transport from and to Aosta. I also remember - it can always be useful as a suggestion, also with a view to limiting city traffic and the consequent increase in polluting load, because our goal is not to bring cars to the city, but to prevent traffic from increasing in the city - which is available, I also say it for the benefit of those who listen to us, at more than calm rates, the subscription of 15 euros per month for the parking of La Ville in via 1 ° May, which is the former Cogne area, which has 540 places, from which the university headquarters can be easily reached in less than a quarter of an hour. We are talking about young boys, of people not prevented in any way, so the invitation is also to look ten minutes from the university headquarters. At 15 euros per month it is possible to take a subscription, without any kind of limitation, reaching the university in ten to fifteen minutes. I conclude this answer of mine by thanking it again for the initiative, I hope that the answer has comforted it. By the month of November the parking lot will also end and, among other things, this is an initiative that has allowed me to update, as well as on the time of parking completion, also on the multiple possibilities related to the stop. Among other things, there is also a series of free parking parking near the University headquarters. I remember the Ferrando area, which is five minutes of passage. I was therefore also able to inform about public mobility, which I believe was also organized taking into account the needs of our boys who attend university."
47947,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,2061,"I listened to his response, councilor, we knew that there is the parking, during the set -up, from 111 seats for the staff, but, having deduced the staff, the students will remain very few and above all not sufficient compared to the needs. If you have done, or want to do, a survey, it is at least a few hundred parking spaces needed for the boys. I will tell you more: she has made an intervention all focused on the fact that you have to discourage the use of the machine to get to the center of Aosta. From the point of view of the principle it is more than shareable, but in terms of concreteness I can tell you that if children and families choose the car it is because probably there is no alternative compared to needs, because using the car costs more than the public vehicle. There is no one who, by vocation, disperses the financial resources it has available, when you spend more than what most seems necessary, is because there is probably a problem. Then we understand very well and we know that there are concessions for the use of public transport, but here there is also a problem of timetables and attendance of the location, there is the problem that, to get there and then to leave, maybe it takes two hours to get home, because there will be one at the bus; If I finish the lesson as soon as the bus started, it means that I have to wait an hour the bus and then make another hour of travel. If this happens every day, it understands that it is a strong discomfort. If we have made a report of this type it means that the problem is heard and I believe that the same students will report directly to you - because we have been reported to us - the problem they are experiencing, and then we will see if you can find a solution, because actually I assure you that it is hundreds of cars that must find a arrangement and that to date the most park them in the blue areas, because it is not easy to find stalls, spending 8-10 euros per day."
47948,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,(LEGA VDA,2,2361,"This is a question relating to the fixed -term contracts of the teachers. In April of this year, 7 teachers, assumed precisely with a fixed -term contract, in service in our schools, obtained the right to recognition to the seniority shots from the Aosta Labor Judge and, therefore, to the consequent remuneration treatments. Specifically, the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta - it seems, at least, from the news we had from the press, etc. - was condemned to recognize these teachers, by way of pay differences, an amount around 45,000 euros. It is clear that other causes could probably arrive, in relation to this issue that, as we remember, is similar enough to that of the teachers' bonuses of some time ago, which was then resolved, as well as with disbursement of legal expenses and compensation, also with specific measures that must then be taken to remedy this problem that was spreading. We also remember that the European Commission has referred Italy to the EU Court of Justice for the abusive use of fixed -term contracts and discriminatory working conditions in schools. According to the European Commission, in fact, Italian legislation implements discrimination between the teachers of fixed -term public schools and those hired for a permanent permanent, because it does not provide for the former a salary progression based on previous service periods. It can also be questionable from the point of view of law, but this is. Therefore, article 2, first paragraph, letter a), of the Statute of Autonomy, based on which the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, in fact, has primary legislative competence as regards the legal -economic state of the staff of the staff, we question the government to know this: ""If the regional administration has made aware of the aforementioned provision of referral of the Court of Justice EU"" -I think of yes -""if the estimates have been made on what the consequences could have been made assets for the regional administration as a result of the aforementioned guidelines of the national and European Union Jurisdictional Bodies ""and"" if it is the intention of the regional government to prevent further future disputes and, if positive, through what specific actions ""."
47948,XVI,07/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,6104,"Being very technical issues, of which she is certainly more practical than me, I made myself written a contribution from the offices, which have however also connected with the lawyer. I answer them not politically and then in the end I make a very small divarre, not even politics, but of a trade union, if he wants. Yes, I am aware of the decision of the European Commission who referred Italy. She asks me if the administration is aware of it. Yes, the European Court of Justice, so that the conditions for appeals to fixed -term contracts are reduced, so that precarious teachers have the same seniority shots as tenured teachers ... and this in the name of a full equalization of the rights. You recalled, among other things, the question of the teacher bonus, there we managed to operate locally through the tools that are granted, precisely because we believe, among other things, in the equalization of the rights of people who do the same things. I add that, to proceed with a concrete solution of this complex question, which has been one of the major problems of the Italian school for a long time, - and we know -, a national legislative intervention is needed, because Italian legislation, which determines the remuneration of fixed -term teachers in public schools, does not provide for an incremental wage progression based on previous service periods. It should be remembered, in fact, that the Presidential Decree no. 861/1975, which is the standard of implementation of the Statute, provides that to the managerial and teacher personnel belonging to the roles of the Valle d'Aosta Region, as regards the legal state and the economic and career treatment, the rules in force for the corresponding staff of the institutes and schools functioning in the remaining territory of the State are concerned. This knows this, having among other things also held for a time the role of councilor for education. We are bound, as regards the legal state and the economic and career treatment, to national rules and the national contract. The question two, ""if estimates have been asked and what the consequences could be, etc."": it is impossible, the offices tell me - but it is theme of which we debate daily, because I don't even like to see, of course, the exciting region compared to appeals, just as I don't like to see serial appeals, which in the end bring money to the lawyers and these are obviously public money - but I was impossible to do it. The audience of potential beneficiaries is represented by the alternates who have exceeded 36 months of service with fixed -term contracts, but it is not possible to quantify the number, because the number of those who will continue to work in the school is not preventive, above all because for the school sector there is no predetermined requirement plan of the substitutes, as the fixed -term contracts are defined both in the adjustment phase of the both following various contractual events of role teachers, such as part-time, mobility or other types of permits, and throughout the school year to cover diseases, pregnancies, leave and expectations. Also on this we have compared ourselves and there is an anal of uncertainty with respect to even a possibility of making estimates that are minimally reliable, precisely because there are many hours and situations that annually intervene, both in the redefinition phase of the staff, after the staff staff, and in the phase of use of the permits and of all the types of contracts to which the teachers have the right. Then she asks me ""if it is the intention of the government to prevent further future disputes and, if positive, through what specifications"". If you could, I can assure you that no one would like to confront each other daily with disputes that, however, politically always lead to politically not so positive situations. As I said before, where we were able to intervene - the question of the teacher bonus, for example, is one of these, as now, for example, in defining the supplementary contract on study permits - we have tried to intervene at the level of supplementary bargaining. As an answer, I read what the offices have written to me: ""It should be noted that, starting from the latest PNRR 2023 competition, the logic was to gradually reduce the precariousness, with the provision of a reserve of places of 30% for precarious teachers with at least three years of service, even non -continuous, in the previous 5 years"". A legislative maneuver was made which in my opinion was also interesting. With this measure foreseen in the national call, our superintendency has provided for in the regional announcement of the aforementioned ordinary competition 2023, referred to in the decree of the President of the Region no. 12 of 15 January 2024, to include all suitable candidates in the regional rankings, and not only the winners, thus allowing, at the time of the entrances in the role for the school year 2024-2025, to scroll these rankings and take more teachers than the number of places originally banned. It is recalled, in fact, that in August the superintendency of studies ordered the hiring of 86 new teachers compared to 36 last year. As already mentioned, however, it will be at national level that it will be necessary to prepare the necessary rules to reduce the use of a succession of fixed -term contracts in the school sector, therefore we wait for that at national level it will be accepted so that this phenomenon, which you have reported as a non -positive phenomenon, can somehow be ruined. I continue to guarantee that, since the meetings with trade union organizations are very frequent, we are working to try to adjust, where possible, the situations of precariousness and the situations that have negative repercussions on employees who work for the school system for some time now."

This is a really heavy Achilles heel for our society. I therefore understand how there is the desire to resolve this question and that they are issues that also fall from above, which cannot then be managed firsthand. The precariousness has been there for too many years, it is too widespread, and I say it by a party in which in particular Senator Pittoni has committed a lot on this area. However, I believe that something can be done, indeed, a lot. Then the judgments in which they tell you that the precariousness is illegitimate come clearly and you must also provide career progression, which seems a bit paradoxical, for one that works on a fixed -term period, but in fact it is a problem of a contradiction in terms that becomes difficult to solve. What would be appropriate, perhaps, but I throw it there just as a suggestion, because it is really difficult and I understand very well what the situation so muddy in this sector is ... she told me that you have continuous dialogues with the unions, so trying to maintain a continuous dialogue, of course, it is not only the unions that send people from lawyers, we would miss, I find myself in a sort of vague conflict of interest, Do not spend unnecessary money for causes that are also discounted, such as those of the teacher bonus, when there are previous jurisprudentials so determined by now is useless, you are almost forced to suffer causes that you already know that you will lose, so it is a truly paradoxical thing, but perhaps in that view, raising awareness of the unions, which are then the only interlocutors ... you cannot go to take them to one and perhaps even identify the teachers who could have these characteristics; Sensitizing the unions, trying to obtain at least a sort of moratorium in saying that, when, as we are already doing, we put in place of the policies of greater hiring, we hope with effective national legislative interventions, there will probably be the way to reconcile, or at least to prevent the causes in the sense of saying that, once there will be a legislative and regulatory panorama a little more precise, to those who have accrued those rights: ""You are not doing a cause, let's decide how much we have to"", which is always the best conciliatory solution when you know you are a debtor of someone, albeit, as in this case, innocently."

As had been reported in the article that we mentioned in the premises, obviously there are no doubts about the discourse of the problems related to the management of the wolf, the speech of the wine sector and the speech of the enhancement of the food and wine sector, products, our excellence, we are the first to share all these aspects. As she told me, starting from her answer, there were all the Italian regions present at this appointment, therefore a great opportunity, a great event. It is precisely for this reason that we are increasingly convinced that these must be opportunities to make the most of the opportunities that are given to the Valle d'Aosta region to show off its excellence but, above all, as we often say, to reiterate and convey the image of our region, its brand, of this brand Valle d'Aosta, ""Logo Cuore, Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"", because there are many occasions. Tourists, people, spectators who pass in these appointments, who get to promote, as we have said, our region from all points of view, not only agriculture, in our opinion is increasingly appropriate to try to also meet other realities and our competitors. We also want to make a reference to the fact that we have mentioned in the premises what is written in the Defr regarding agriculture; As for the tourism department, however, in the Defr it is said that, from the point of view of the promotion-public action, we will continue with the adoption of different initiatives aimed at increasing the brand's reputation, both on the national and international markets. This was a passage that we wanted to say precisely to reiterate that we do more and more synergy among the various departments, because I believe that we are all convinced that - when there are events or opportunities to show off the excellence from a tourist, sporting, cultural or food and wine point of view - all this is tourism. The presence and conveying of this trademark (which has recently been recorded, but is strategic throughout our region) we think it is increasingly fundamental. I conclude by saying that this initiative wanted to understand, especially from a political point of view, if there is the intention and belief of conveying in a synergistic way, since now, this important brand ""Heart Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"", a unique image that characterizes, promotes and enhance the different councilors of our region in a transversal way. I think this is the way to go. It is not simple, but only in this way can we still grow from a tourist and promotional point of view and bring an image of the Aosta Valley increasingly important at national level, but above all internationally. From 12:04 the vice -president Margurettaz assumes the presidency."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,5261,"We have already dealt with this theme last council because, in fact, it had been brought to the agenda by colleague Minelli on the Defr, but perhaps some more study is necessary, because, in fact, we learned from his hearing in the commission and by the coordinator - and subsequently he also explained it during the discussion of the agenda - that the companies Monte Rosa and Cervino moved in the process of Cosiddetto Docfap, the feasibility document of the planning alternatives, based on the decree, based on the decree, Legislative 36/2023. At the moment, when he mentioned this legislative decree, apart from those who are a technician ... For us it was not absolutely easy to make an immediate study, because precisely the Docfap is regulated in annex 1.7 of the legislative decree, which is somewhat full -bodied. What is the point? The new contract code has changed the discipline of the design, providing for two design levels and including, among other things, the feasibility document of the design alternatives, which must be drawn up in compliance with the contents of the demanding framework and is prodromal to the drafting of the address document to the design, the so -called Dip. Dip that indicates, in relation to the size, the specific type and category of the intervention to be carried out, the characteristics, requirements and design documents necessary for the definition of each level of the design. With this Docfap, therefore, the first step was sanctioned to start the design of the work, without however the advice said anything about the study. The same companies in the hearing - I will not report the minutes, because I have not yet understood whether it can be done or not, theoretically not - however they had sanctioned the fact that the study would then give us councilors the tools to give the same companies to proceed with an executive and definitive design. Instead, with this document it would therefore already exceed the study, without precisely we expressed ourselves, to evaluate the best alternative among those proposed and to start the design of the work. But it does not seem to me that, in fact, these were the agreements. Certainly we are not technicians, but at least to deepen the question, especially economic-financial, I believe it is absolutely essential, given that the companies have even asked for a regional 100% financing. It is okay that it is participated, so the money, on the one hand or on the other, is always public money in some way, however - having the loan requested a special law which, as for the skyway, financed 100% - rightly a series of considerations must be made. Councilor, she knows very well that from our point of view we are absolutely not contrary to the project, on the contrary, but we know that it is a project of a truly large importance and therefore certainly all the necessary insights must be made, as had been said in any case. Surely then it will reply that in reality this step forward was traced by the LEGGSI, regarding the technical-economic feasibility, but the Council, at least from this side, has played a totally marginal role. We have already talked about it: that there is the political will by the majority to carry out this project is out of any doubt, nobody questioned it absolutely, indeed; However, precisely because it was sanctioned that it was the advice that had to contribute and be participated in the analysis, in the study and then also in the evaluation of the technical-economic feasibility of the work, this process I believe must be carried forward. I really hope that there has been a sort of misunderstanding between her and the commission president, because it seems that maybe ... but she rightly did not participate in the auditions, so she cannot know what she said and what is not, perhaps it may have believed that after that hearing you could go on without any kind of problem and that the analysis of the study had ended, which is in reality not true. This initiative is used precisely to clarify and you want a minimum to reiterate if there is the intention of making the regional council express on this study and on the alternatives proposed in it: premising that we are not technicians, so we cannot say if alternative 1 or alternative 3 goes well, because we certainly do not have the skills, at least, I on a personal level, to say what is the best thing, but to deepen the question, given that it is a very full -bodied study. ""What is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the custody of the Docfap, in this case exhausted the regional council, when it was said that the study was preparatory to the Docfap"": if we have not given any kind of opinion on the study, I do not understand why it is already going on in this sense. Furthermore, ""who was the decision"" - if his, councilor, or of the companies - ""to proceed with the next custody of the feasibility document of the design alternatives without even communicating it to the regional council, if not as a process started""."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,4,4884,"Thank you, I connect Lavy, also for how he illustrated the initiative. Probably the theme is a theme of great importance and it can also be that, compared to terminology on a technical level, sometimes there may be misunderstandings, or even a wrong communication on my part, as of the coordinator, as happened during the audition. I clarified it during the discussion of last advice. I come to the answers and then I also try to make two political considerations. On the part of the majority, to come to the first question, ""if there is the intention of having the regional council on study and alternatives proposed in it express"", I would not answer exactly this question. If there is the political will to continue to confront the Commission and the Council: yes. I believe it is necessary, the commission president also said it on the last occasion: to make a meeting, perhaps more restricted, to understand the oppositions what they ask to do this in -depth work and what we can give, as a political role, to the bodies we have. She said and I repeat it: on a technical level it would be wrong to replace, also because, beyond the skills, there is also a question of responsibility for the expected processing. The majority has no intention of not working openly on this project, we have done so since 2020, from the first Defr, and we did it later. The Defr indicate the paths, but these absolutely do not preclude the comparison. It is necessary to understand, once and for all - but I am also available for a meeting with the commissions or with the group leaders, with who will want to - understand what is meant by expression of the Council, so we go in detail. More colleagues asked for it, colleague Minelli asked for it and the colleague aggravated asked for it: we decide what is the role we want to give at this stage and we do it. We would miss that we wanted not to collaborate on projects of such a wide range and interest. We are very convinced that the operation can go on, we said it; This is also supported by a whole series of expressions of the structures by the regional administration. The Lega group said it already then, as I got to say during the last discussion in the classroom: even the Lega group, when we had made this choice on the Defr 2022, had considered it a step even too braked, then the deepening is welcome. I repeat: let's see what is required, if a further hearing in commission on that document, or anything else. In point 2, ""what is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the custody of the feasibility document of the work alternatives of the work, exhausing the regional council, when their leaders repeatedly stressed that it would have been the regional council that decides what should have been done"". On this probably the question was asked following the hearing. Last advice I said that this is not a new document, the document is the initial one, that of the custody of the project, which companies considered, pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023, article 41, attachment 1.7 - more than companies, professionals who analyzed the study for the company - which can be a Docfap still to be completed, so there has not been an indication of moving forward, rather of giving that project the value of Docfap. To date, it has not yet been approved and the companies, to approve it, obviously also ask the regional administration on the next steps and the activation of a special program agreement. This is why in the Defr of the past year and this year we have said that it is necessary to start the authorization process, so that we can then express the structures possibly on the whole procedure. Question 3 at this point is overcome, in the sense that there has not been an indication of moving forward, but rather now it is also the companies that ask the political part - to the Council, to the junta, the majority - how to proceed, because a series of elements is missing, in particular, it was said the other time, it would be necessary to proceed with the Vas and Vinca. To go on, in fact, an administrative process must be governed, which could be disciplined through a program agreement. I repeat that there were perhaps moments when we were not clear enough, I say it also because several times there have been in this hall comparisons with colleague Minelli. It is necessary to understand what is the role that the Council must take on, if it is the Council, or the Commission, if it is the Commission, compared to the documents that we have today. We will certainly not preclude a discussion on the subject."
47950,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,1858,"I am satisfied, I also appreciated the tones with which he said there is maximum availability. True, the question mark was in some way to understand how to work, because it has always been said that the Council has a central role, but it has not been defined as and what the Council means has a central role. A meeting between the group leader is making us to decide the next steps to carry on. I think it is absolutely correct and something truthful that there is the will, I believe from everyone, in confronting this theme. As for the answer to the second question, I understood that she, in fact, has nothing to do with it and I had no doubts about this. In some way, it leaves me some question mark, however, the attitude of the companies, because, having perhaps not had any type of response on the political part, to understand how the analysis of this study would have gone on, perhaps a phone call to someone from the Council, perhaps not to her, but to the commission president, to understand if the analysis of the study in the commission would have gone on, perhaps it had to be done. Because, as I said before, the Docfap is a preliminary document to the design and had been repeatedly reiterated that the study served us to then give addresses for the design, to carry on these procedures, which was not done. We know very well that when it comes to certain topics, some doubts come out. I'm not talking about her, councilor, I speak at the level of society, because several times we see some attitudes that create many questions, to say not. I therefore appreciate his spirit, I appreciate the fact that in any case he is also to us, as councilors, seeing and deciding what we want to synthesize this centrality of the Council, so we will surely update."
47952,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,2423,"Thank you, President, for the prompt passion with which he gives me the floor. We always come to the transport and buses theme. Let's talk about the experimental public transport service for connection with the Milan Malpensa international airport. Highlighted that this line, which was in service from 5 July to 9 September 2024, was operational on Monday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and holidays; Recalled that - this is a 2016 fact, if I made a mistake in the commitment, the commissioner will correct me, it is a fact that I found on the Sole 24 Ore - following the acquisition of 100% Savda by the group arrivals Italy, the public traffic by rubber in the Aosta Valley is managed at 50% by this company; Considering that, looking at the site, the line is currently temporarily suspended and please refer to the next reactivation in December 2024; Let's ask three precise questions. The first: ""What were the results of this experimentation during the summer months, if there has been satisfaction"", of course they reported the fact that those who have to take the bus to go to Malpensa would have needed this bus on several days, this is a bit the ratio of the question, but you will give us information on this; ""What reasons determined the specific limit of the days of operating during the period carried out""; ""What intentions has the regional administration"", so maybe you give an information outside a little earlier than what will happen on the company's website, to allow people to know which and when other buses of this type will be there; ""When there is the reactivation of the service and the possible limitation of the operational days in the winter tourism period"". These are the questions. En passant, given that we are talking about electric mobility - this is not aimed at anyone in particular, but I follow myself perfectly at the topic, in order not to incur the reference to the topic that is present in the regulation - Norway is one of the main international oil producers and one of the first exporters to the world of natural gas, therefore, even if it had all the electric cars, clearly Norway is made its accounts and sells the oil and natural to the whole world. Then he has electric cars in his house and many enhance the case of Norway. Brilliant. We come to our bus. Thanks, councilor."
47952,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,4,3917,"Returning to the Aosta Valley, our buses and connections with Malpensa, which are also smaller means of transport, lighter, as a connection; ""What were the results of this experimentation during the summer months"": precisely because we are talking about experimentation, the connection was introduced in the past for the winter period and we decided to try to experiment with it even in summer periods. 839 people were transported between July and September. There is also distributed timetable, where there is greater use. We also tried to introduce a night time, to try to connect to international connections that start at other times. Experimentation is a positive experimentation. Probably the service - in fact we also talked about it with the commissioner Grosjacques, with the Office - must be more advertised, the information must be given both as regards the local population, but above all for tourists, that this possibility is there and there is in this experimental form. The goal is clear that it should be to achieve ... and I already come to the second question: ""What reasons have determined the specific limit of the days of operating during the period carried out"": precisely because it is an experimentation, we have tried to give this experimentation a first part of organization linked to the periods of greater travel, in particular for the moments of arrival and departure of people. The ideal would be to be able to extend it, indeed, to have it completely at service throughout the week. It is also a matter of cost evaluation, we must understand if, by implementing the service, the greatest use can make the expense congruous or if we risk not having this optimization. For my part, on our part, there is no limit to thinking in this sense. It is always a question of making the best use of resources and trying to do it in the best way to also guarantee the economic system, in particular to the hotel system, an extra service for its customers. The evaluation was conducted, in fact, together with the carrier and the hoteliers' association. This winter will work to make a reasoning on next summer and to evaluate whether the service can be implemented. It seems to us a good service, the evaluation we give is that it is a useful service, necessary - especially given the phase we live with transport - and that it can give added value to our territory. As for point 3, ""what intentions the regional administration regarding the new activation of the service and the possible limitation to operational days in the winter tourist period"", the service is in operation until 31/12 because the administrative planning could be made with a commitment up to that date. Soon we will bring the commitment resolutions for the following years and obviously the service will continue during this winter and also during the next summer, with some time changes. As I said, we also introduced departures from Aosta to 03:00 in the morning and 05:30 from Friday to Sunday in Malpensa, because that is the time of arrival of international flights. Some evaluations have been made; The service will continue, the goal is to make it grow and advertise it more and also understand, directly from those who can have an advantage, if other improvements can be made, making it grow and knowing that we must make more resources available. It is a service that also provides for payment from people, therefore it has a cost that, if well used, can be optimized, because, a bit like all transport services, if they carry an added value, this added then is distributed to the territory and on the survey."

You rightly made your evaluations and the company too, I can simply tell you that - since we had received reports that require implementation, probably with other assessments - if you manage to extend it to other days badly would not do and could be an important service. Only this I tell you, meanwhile thank you."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,2,1636,"Let's go back to the question of the roundabout in the former Fera in the municipality of Saint-Vincent. It is a theme that we have already talked about on several occasions in this regional council, presenting inspection initiatives, finally that of April 17, 2024. On that occasion we were told by the competent councilor who was being updated by the executive design of the initiative and awaiting the program agreement necessary to be stipulated with Anas. We reported the matter on the agenda today, because we believe it is an extremely dangerous situation. We see a generalized attention in the area, with the creation of roundabouts, but it has been several years, indeed, I could say that more than ten years has been talking about this topic, of this roundabout, and also of another initiative, always on the Saint-Vincent ring road, which has not yet been examined, in correspondence with the cemetery location; These are situations in which there is a large need for intervention. It amazes us that nothing has yet been implemented in this location. There have been different inspections in the former Fera, even a few hundred meters after Fera, where there is access to the Champcillien locality, we also spoke of this, with a situation of extreme danger. There they have already deceased seven-eight people in road accidents and is not putting in the situation. Therefore, with this initiative we want to ask if the executive design has finally been completed and if the program agreement for the financing of the work has been defined."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,4,4272,"Thanks, connect Marquis, because this initiative allows us to update, to take stock after what we had said, if I'm not mistaken, in April. Compared to the previous intervention of spring, the amount of the financing provided for the state roads of our region can be confirmed within the new program agreement between the Ministry of Infrastructure and Anas, an agreement that has been approved with the Cipes resolution (Interministerial Committee for economic programming and sustainable development) and was published in the Official Gazette on 10 of July. The new assignments, as we have already said - are official - amount to 9 million, which are added to the 5 million already assigned in anticipation with budget law resources of 2021 and 2022. On the basis of the basis of the amount of state funding, this administration has carried out a series of meetings with the technical structures of Anas, and another is scheduled for next week, to start the comparison on the projects to be included on the next update of the program. We can therefore anticipate that, as a regional department, we asked Anas that the future plan includes the creation of new roundabouts along the state road, more precisely therefore: in the municipality of Pont-Saint-Martin; in the municipality of Châtillon, to the intersection with via Pellissier; In the municipality of Saint-Denis, at the entrance of the regional road to Pontey: we asked for the division of an important intervention, which provided for the Pontey roundabout with the hamlet that is located in Châtillon, then going to divide that intervention, giving priority to the Pontey roundabout; With regard to the intervention that gives access to the Municipality of ChampdePraz, the creation of a roundabout, as already mentioned in a previous question by colleague Brunod, is particularly complicated, but is being thought of a safety intervention that goes to improve the current situation; Finally in the municipality of Saint-Vincent, with two interventions requested: the one in Fera, which was already partly scheduled, and the new roundabout at the intersection with the road of the cemetery, which she rightly cited. The second question: the roundabout in Fera is considered, both by the regional and municipal administration by the municipal one, strategic for the artisan area as well as to secure the roads of the area and can also be an improvement in the road infrastructure also for the inhabitants and the visitors of the neighboring hamlets, coming from the Municipality of Montjovet. Even before the formalization of this agreement, of the new state funding that we referred above, the construction of the Fera roundabout had been the subject of interlocutions with Anas, interlocutions that led to the definition of the design process, which was shared with the municipal administration of Saint-Vincent; iter started and in progress. Unlike the other roundabouts referred to above, in fact, the Rottoria di locality Fera had an advanced state of development, in fact Anas had already acquired part of the design. In this regard, we urged Anas, who tells us that the design update is being concluded and is presumed that it will be finished by the end of the current year. The works for the construction of the Fera roundabout are inserted by Anas in the intervention called AO 280, which also provides for the Rotatorials of Verrayes, in Champagne, and Morgex, at the height of the motorway junction. This was included among the interventions for the adaptation and safety of the 2016-2020 program contract, which was therefore re-proposed in the new program contract 2021-2025, to cover the additional economic needs compared to the funds previously allocated. We had these 5 million, which were in fact the surplus with the project of these two roundabouts, Verrayes and Morgex, inside which Fera had already been inserted. The 5 million did not cover everything, with the new allocation of these 9, which brings the total to 14 million, here is the total coverage of this roundabout, plus those I had mentioned a little while ago."
47953,XVI,07/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,1247,"Finally perhaps we come to concretize the result. Since the executive design is still in the update and since we had already talked about it and I also recalled that the roundabout in Fera is nearby, near the Champcillien crossroads, so there are 200-300 meters still of the road to be done, and you had done with the Anas at the time the inspection, with which the extreme danger of that situation had been found, where I said before. already numerous deaths; I believe that it is worth solving the Anas or verify that the remediation and redevelopment of that situation have also been included. Otherwise it is not possible to put your hand with different practices, if it is not included in this initiative. I would invite you, councilor, to verify this, because otherwise there are big risks in that situation, if you cannot reduce the risk that is there today, because it is extremely dangerous. We take note with satisfaction that it would seem that the work has come to finance. We will still monitor the evolution of the situation from now on, to prevent there are further delays compared to those who have already been there so far."

Last year in our country there were about 44,000 new diagnoses of lung cancer, with over 35,000 deaths in 2022. During the initiative it was reported as in Italy in the 15-17 year old range, 30% declared a smoking"". After the article, the urgency of intensifying awareness campaigns on the phenomenon of tabagism among teenagers also through the programming of some lessons on the damage of tobacco in the presence of health specialists in the sector was reiterated by the National Coordination of the Discipline of Human Rights; We note that to date ... but today it was referred to October 4th because the initiative is obviously an old initiative, which is reported within the official site USLVDA.it, there are some pages and sections relating to the prevention of the regional prevention plan that report the wording: ""pages under construction"". In these days we have verified that the prevention page has been completed, so it is no longer under construction, while, as regards the regional prevention plan section, there is still a section that is under construction; We remind you that on 6 December 2021 it was approved with regional council resolution no. 1654 The regional prevention plan 2021-2025. This plan identifies ten predefined programs and three free regional, integrated and transversal programs, with which it is intended to implement all the macro objectives and all the strategic objectives of the National Prevention Plan 2020-2025. The competent councilors are therefore asked to know: what is the situation today in the regional territory compared to what is represented at national level, how many and what initiatives are promoted by their respective departments regarding the raising awareness of the damage of tabagism in schools and also in general, that is, without considering the classic days or anniversaries; If there is the intention to promote and intensify new activities, projects and awareness campaigns against the damage of tobagism in the regional territory."
47954,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6058,"Coming to the question n. 1: ""How the situation is on the regional territory compared to what is represented at national level"", we return to a topic that has already been the subject of debate during the regional council of the month of July. The data we report are precisely taken from the surveillance of 2022-2023. In the Aosta Valley among adults 18-69 years 60.6% (Data Italy 58.7) of the interviewees are non-smoker, 13.7% (Data Italy 16.8) can be classified as a former smoker on 25.7 (data Italy 24.5) is as a smoker. Among the interviewees, those who declared that they smoke every day are 24%. With reference to young people, a 2022 study on behavior connected to health in school -age children photographed and monitored the health of Italian teenagers of 11, 13 and 15 years old and, for the first time, also of 17 -year -old boys. The framework of the schools of the Aosta Valley which emerged is in improvement as it is characterized by a perception of adequacy of the structures and attention to health promotion activities. As for smoking, from the study it emerges that most of the interviewee boys said they had never smoked. The percentage of non -smokers is reduced by increasing age, going from 99% of eleventh -year -olds to 96.6% of the thirteen -year -olds up to 89.5 of the fifteen -year -olds. Furthermore, the data tell us that from 2019 to today the habit of smoking has significantly decreased, in fact the percentage of young Aosta Valley who have never smoked has gone from 78.6% in 2018 to 92.2 of 2022. Coming on the question no. 2, the attention to the prevention linked to smoking is contained in the regional prevention plan, as reported by you, in particular in the context of the ""Schools who promote health"" program, and identifies some strategic intervention lines aimed at promoting in the school context lifestyles of life in favor of health, including the fight against the consumption of tobacco products and with nicotine. In the school year 2023-2024, with the coordination of the superintendence of colleague Guichardaz's studies, which we thank for the contribution given, in schools on schools were presented in this topic consolidated over time on tabagism and other dependencies, of the initiative of the Valle d'Aosta Lilt, with the active involvement of the first and secondary classes of the secondary school of second degree and a recovery project, use and use. Recycling of the US electronic cigarettes made at the Verrès ISILTEP. As regards the ""addiction"" program, always foreseen in the regional prevention plan, specific actions, also of health promotion, are concretized by the consolidated activity of the employment service of the USL company. The ser.d. In fact, it has a micro team dedicated to the treatment of nicotine use disorder, composed of doctor and psychologist. From the data updated in July 2024 it emerges that 31 patients took over by the Ser.D., including a minor patient. In May of this year, the members of the aforementioned team participated in a transmission of a radio broadcaster addressed to the entire population. In the prevention activities carried out with first and second grade secondary school students as part of the interinstitutional table for educational co -responsibility and legality by the Ser.D operators. The focus are addictions, of course 360 ​​degrees. Smoking is treated together with other dependencies on substance and behavioral. A awareness event aimed at the institutions took place on May 31, 2022 at the Ollignan Onlus System Foundation entitled ""The seduction of smoke"", financed with ministerial bound funds. Coming to the question n. 3, as we have already anticipated during the works of the Regional Council in July last, in response to an initiative on the issue of baby smokers, we confirm that as part of the ""dependenc"" program of the regional prevention plan, in collaboration with the Ser.D. of the USL company, the design for 2025 of an awareness of smoking is initially in the initial phase. The initiative is aimed at young generations and intends to use forms of communication more responding to the target of the very young to whom it is addressed and to intercept young people both in the school and extracurricular fields. With regard to awareness of the youth world, we also inform that it is under implementation by the Ser.D., entrusted to ""Being Umani Onlus"", the Youngle project that aims to primary and secondary prevention and is aimed at the population of the adolescent band.

It is in fact a web app, therefore of a web application, in which the young man can anonymously chat with an equal of his own problems: from sexuality to the relationship, of course to the substances. Peer educators, i.e. peer educators, are trained and supervised by professionals and can possibly advise an sending to dedicated services. They will also constitute the editorial staff in charge of opening social pages in which to convey messages addressed to the current lifestyles, including smoking abstention. A further strengthening of therapeutic options, therefore secondary prevention, will be given to use - to be introduced - also of the repetitive magnetic -transcranial stimulation in the treatment of nicotine use disorder, alongside the other treatmental principals. We have introduced this treatment in regional additional Lea with resolution no. 1082/2024 and the treatment will be free for the entire Valley resident population. We remind you that we are the only and the first region currently having inserted the transcranance in the free additional Lea for its population."

It is a very complete, very technical answer, where he provided many data. Obviously we wanted to emphasize that we have reappeared this initiative despite the fact that one had already been made by his colleague Lucianaz in July, because within the response that you had already provided there were still data, which now reconfirmed me, of studies made in 2022. Having released this article, which we mentioned in the premises, at the end of September 2024, reporting data at national level, we wanted to understand the photography at the regional level updated to understand if There was the possibility of embarking on new paths to get more updated data, which give a general picture of the most updated problem regarding this problem of the effects of tobagism. She replied completely, but reporting in her response much of what had already been reported in July, therefore on the various initiatives that the Department is undertaking we are pleased, obviously paying attention through these inspection initiatives on themes on which we are convinced that everyone pays the maximum attention, try to do more and more an excellent job, more and more synergy between what is health, education, youth world, to try to reduce these problems as much as possible, To sensitize. At the same time, as it was reiterated within this article that we have mentioned, through these initiatives, these projects, that there is increasingly the presence of health specialists in the sector that bring better, more representatively, but on a technical level the situations and above all the problems to make people understand what can be encountered. Our attention will always be a lot on this theme, we trust that there are increasingly important projects in this regard. Here too she told me what had already been reported in July that in collaboration with the Ser.D. It is in the initial design phase for 2025. This is what she said today and it is the same thing that had been reported in July, so we understood that, in this respect, we are still in the processing phase of this project. We have not had big details forward precisely because it is probably still in the development phase. Surely it will be very important to start in a complete and deepened way under this topic, as we have already reiterated, therefore further on we will return to the subject, not in a critical and polemical way, but to put attention to this problem together."

The first tends to reorganize governance as part of the regional welfare system, with specific reference to the separation of the programming function of social policies from the management function of the services through the establishment of an instrumental body to which to entrust the management of socio-welfare services, including the socio-professional service, in terms of the essential level of social benefits. The second constitute the control room for the definition of the new organizational and management structure of services and social interventions, the preparation of a feasibility study for the establishment of an instrumental body and the manager of social services and the revision of the zone plan of the Aosta Valley. The initiative is on 4 October. The previous Council had been discussed with Councilor Marzi a question entitled: ""News regarding the meetings of representatives of the regional government with cooperative companies in relation to the future management of micro communities"", during which the councilor had already partially given a piece, which was then useful for the preparation of this interpellation, in particular the contents of resolution no. 282, therefore of the control room and also of the assignment precisely to an external body with proven skills and experience in the field of programming and review of organizational, procedural, management models of services in the context of social policies to be accompanied by the structures of social policies. We then found in the document of economics and finance in two sections, one relating to the presidency of the Region, a passage, of which I quote a part, or the fact that the appropriate assessments will be carried out regarding the evolution of the Service company Valle d'Aosta S.p.A. and the services provided by the same in order to rethink the legal structure with particular reference to the new needs for the provision of social, socio-welfare and socio-educational services. A part then in the health department, health and social policies, which in fact resumes the objectives that have been represented by the plan of health and social well -being. What we ask the councilor is: ""if the potential"" constituting ""instrumental body, as mentioned in the two passages of the document of economics and regional finance, corresponds to the same""; I apologize for the typo, not ""the same"", of course. It looks like a trivial question, but in reality it is not, because objectively even in the auditions of the Defr every now and then the doubt has arisen, even in those of the previous Defr, so at least the question is clear and we will have, I hope, but I am sure, a clear answer. The other questions are: ""What addresses were given to the external body to which the support of the offices of the social policies department was entrusted with the regional council resolution - which I have already mentioned - in particular if among these there are, among other things, indications regarding the evaluations regarding the evolution of the service company; if it is the intention to involve any third sector entities during the carrying out of the activities relating to the subsequent point of view and in the previous point, Terms; if in the face of the possible creation of the instrumental institution referred to in the premises, the regional government intends to keep the Valle d'Aosta service company ""in life?"
47955,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6437,"The identification in Section 3 of the Defr 2025-2027 was actually already present in that of 2024-2026, of strategic objectives concerning the management of social services both of the presidency of the Region and of the Healthcare Department, Health and Social Policies, tends to the same purpose. On the one hand, the focus of the presidency of the Region is to evaluate the evolution of the Valle d'Aosta service company in order to rethink its legal structure, in particular as regards the provision of social, socio-assistance and socio-educational services. The need underlying the objective expressed in the part instead of the department of my relevance concerns the reorganization of the system of socio-welfare services, keeping the programming function of territorial social policies by the department, demanding their management of services to a third party. The objectives therefore respond to the same purpose of evolution in the provision of social services. The question not only was not relevant, but, in some ways, we must thank because, we said it on various occasions probably also not effectively, the fact of responding as I have just finished answering I hope the effect of avoiding this type of doubt. Coming to the question n. 2: ""What addresses were given to the external body to which the support of the offices of the social policies department was entrusted with the DGR 282/2024 and, in particular, if among these services there are, among other things, indications regarding the evaluation of the evolution of the Service Service company of the Aosta"", with reference to the addresses given to the Poleis Company, which is assisting the offices of the Region in the preparation of the feasibility study. The feasibility study will have to develop a proposal for the establishment of the instrumental body and for the revision of the Zone Plan of the Aosta Valley in a study report that provides: first point, an evaluation regarding the legal nature that the institutional body must take on, comparing their respective characteristics, strengths and any critical issues, even with the aim of applying all the employees of the future institution, you will remember that the public contract, This point was treated precisely within the reference commission by the undersigned in the hearing of the Defr. Point 2, the evaluation of the economic-organizational sustainability concerning the creation of an instrumental body in charge of the management of personal services, with specific reference to the following services: professional social service, services for people with disabilities, residential services for the elderly, residential services for minors, socio-educational services for minors. The study will specifically develop the following aspects, the organization chart of the instrumental body, the optimal unit cost of the service, the structure of the income statement and the balance sheet, criteria and methods of sharing of the shareholders to financing the company, organizational methods aimed at guaranteeing the coordination of the programming function of social policies with the management function of personal services, with specific reference to the reorganization of the skills of the social policies department in relation to the activities in relation to the activities in relation to the activities delegated to the company. Point 3: A model of revision of the functions and methods of operating the regional zone plan, as a tool for planning the regional social and socio-health policies integrated with other sectoral policies. The study project also provides for support to the structures of the regional administration in the preparation of the bill aimed at the institution, in fact, of the instrumental body and the relative report. Coming to the question n. 3 ""If it is the intention to involve any third sector bodies during the carrying out of the activities relating to the conjunction referred to in the previous point and, in the positive case, in what terms"", the reason why the involvement of third sector entities during the course of the activities relating to the preparation of the feasibility study would be appropriate or appropriate. This is a feasibility study for the establishment of an instrumental body of the Region, therefore at this moment to work together with the company entrusted to technical assistance are the regional structures involved, therefore the structures relating to labor policies, the Department of Social Policies and of course to the superintendency for studies, in addition to the involvement of the personnel department and the management of service companies. Once the feasibility study is completed, the delivery of which is provided for the end of the current year, all the assessments, including political, of the case and therefore, as already communicated, will be able to make the trade union organizations and the reference stakeholders, including of course the third sector entities that are represented, among other things, in the tables of the zone plan for the concertation phase. At the moment, therefore, we are still in the preparation phase of the feasibility study which, as you can imagine, absolutely expresses a whole series of complexities to which to give an answer, those referred to, in fact, in the answer to the application no. 2. Once this phase is completed, the feasibility study will provide the elements useful for political comparison and with the reference stakeholders regarding the establishment of the instrumental body. Coming to the question n. 4 ""If in the face of the possible creation of the instrumental entity referred to in the premises, the regional government intends to keep the service company Valle d'Aosta S.p.A. thus devoid of the provision of services in the social, socio-assistance and socio-educational services"", as well as it is known, she knows it better than me, the service company Valle d'Aosta guarantees the provision of a whole series of activities, as well as in the field of services, also as regards the services to the person. Culture, forest shipbuilding and road works. For these activities it would therefore remain operational."

He did not always work, but he served to understand if the accounts returned. My question n. 3 had a purpose similar to the test of the 9, it is not said that it works, but at least for the moment it makes me understand that the calculations more or less return. The first question, yes, answers the doubts or, better, was considered that there was a need to have a clear answer, also because, as she rightly remembered, already in the previous defr the same indication was present, but at the time we had had some doubts and the auditions organized already last time had not given a univocal, or in any case clear answer. We take note of the elements that constitute the assignment given to the consultancy firm, we will see what the final outcome will be. Obviously there are two themes on which I would like to focus more attention. I repeat: it's a trivial observation but she will welcome her. Certainly the company's financing structure ... I say it because, also with respect to what has already been said in a previous question, it is never to be trivialized or to simplify, because obviously once we start it is good that the structure is well defined for not having to run for cover. It will also be important to understand the methods relating to the application of the public contract considering that today we have a corporate reality which, albeit of public shareholding, still has its own specificity, so we will see what the results of the study will be. As far as the last question is concerned, yes, it is true, perhaps this too may have seemed to have seemed a trivial question, but perhaps it is to be treated more in the overall management of the investee companies which, in the context of its specific proxies. It is true, it remains standing for the other purposes, however, also seeing some indications or in any case clarifications that are made in the latest reports on the management of the company's budget, or in any case also in the context of the programming documents, it is obvious that a further evaluation will have to be made to prevent the company from having shortcomings of profitability in the face of loss, I allow me to be a parallelism, the business units, which will obviously be in the field of the instrumental body."

Meanwhile, a verification that we made directly with the Ministry, how much ... a letter that we then wanted to report, there are large excerpts of the same within the inter -apellance, but it is a letter that was transmitted to both the members of the fifth commission and I obviously imagine, even to her, councilor, but directly the Anga association highlighted critical issues and above all launched an alarm. As we have reported in the text of the interpellation, the Association intends to share concern about the timing of implementing the ministerial decrees of 24 January and 6 February 2023 and, in particular, this is the central part of this interpellation, as regards the funds intended for the basic or applied research, to the increase in the staff of the National Health Service, to the training initiatives, to the development of the territorial network and of individualized life projects assistance to people with autistic spectrum disorder. Precisely on this we know that some interlocutions had intervened, some fruitful because it must be absolutely recognized when there are positive parts, others less, but more than for lack of will we say for the question of stringent timing. In fact, he writes the association: ""More than a year later, it should be noted that in the health sector has not yet been implemented to the aforementioned decrees. Remembering the need for an early, systemic and long life intervention program, in the face of more than 200 people with autism on the regional territory, whose needs still remain awaiting answers, with this Angsa VDA intends to solicit the competent structures to a timely implementation of the aforementioned. decrees "". With this letter evidently the association intends to illuminate, highlight, make known what is a bit of a criticality, or the delays. In fact, he writes the association: ""The failure to use funds within the useful times and their consequent return to the Ministry would constitute a serious lost opportunity, which would harm the whole population with autism and the families of the territory, compromising the improvement of the quality of life, the possibility of recovering and enhancing residual skills and frustrating the realization of the awaited new services, with important repercussions in taking charge of the new generations of subjects with autism"". It is therefore clear that an alarm launched, I believe, in a polite way also by the Association, you absolutely deserve an answer, obviously equally polite, but I know that she is, councilor, to understand if these funds can actually be used, with which timing and prevent it from possibly losing, which therefore cannot be used."
47956,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,3975,"I answer the two questions, that is ""what are the reasons for the delay highlighted by the Anga VDA association and if any useful action has been prepared to use funds in useful times"". First of all, it is pressing that the dialogue between the Department and the USL company is constant and continuous also on the theme of autism. As regards in particular to the funds, with the resolution of the Regional Council n. 628/2023 The plans of activities concerning the autism spectrum disorders were approved on the funds referred to in the ministerial decree of 24 January 2023, for a total of just over 302,000 euros, and to the ministerial decree of 6 February 2023, for 269,591 euros. The latter provides: the study of basic or applied research projects, the increase of the staff of the National Health Service in charge of the provision of the interventions provided for by the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders, developed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, the implementation of training initiatives, the development of a territorial network with a function of recognition, diagnosis and early intervention on neurosviluppo disorders and individualized life projects and based on the concept of quality of life. The purposes and initiatives are aimed at improving the assistance to people with autistic spectrum disorder both in terms of effectiveness in relation to the quality of life of the interested parties and their families, and in terms of organizational adjustment of regional health and socio-welfare networks. All of this was of course shared with the regional technical table, established with the Council resolution no. 1633 which dates back to 2017, which includes, among other things, representatives of the two departments of the Healthcare Department, Health and Social Policies, of the Department of the Studies, of the Policies of Labor and Training Policies, of the University of Valle d'Aosta, of the USL company, including general medical doctors and the pediatricians of free choice, of the associations of the family members of subjects affected by the disturbance of the autism spectrum, relevant support also guaranteed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. Speaking of the institutional grace, the technical table meets periodically and the meetings have always been profitable opportunities for comparison and sharing, as highlighted also in the letter she recalled ... I quote verbatim ""recognizing the merits of having maintained the attention on the resources made available by the national fund"". The theme of the programming and performance of the activities connected to the funding was also the subject of analysis in all the meetings of the technical table which during the current year met on March 7, June 21 and August 7. Soon, among other things, the technical table will be reconvened by providing for an update, as required by Angsa, regarding the interventions provided for by the activities of the activities in the field of ministerial funds referred to. Among the different actions to be worth on the aforementioned funds already on the field in order to provide an answer to the increase in cases of diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder we can mention the increase in human, professional and formal resources dedicated to the services in place, the increase in individualized therapeutic plans, as well as the activation of support paths to school, social and work inclusion. Currently there are also periodic technical meetings between the Department and the USL company focused on the development of the territorial cure network. At the moment, therefore, the planning and activity already underway provide for the use of state resources for the approved purposes. Finally, we inform that the proposal of planning for both the new 2024 and 2025 fund has also been presented to the Ministry."

It is evident that the letter arrived after, of course, the call of the technical table and before the convocation of what you announced, therefore the next, therefore the last call dates back to August, underlines and highlights a problem and a necessity. For maximum transparency I highlighted that there was an effective collaboration with the Department. She wanted to remark it, but I had obviously said it too. It is clear, however, equally evident that, if everything was actually without any criticality, this letter would not have become necessary. Obviously I thank you for your reply, the hope I can do is that as soon as possible the technical table can meet, so when she announced its convocation ... and that from this there may be positive news, because it is clear that the alarm launched is certainly worrying, therefore the fears are absolutely founded. We hope that, in the face of the new call, there are certainly positive answers."

Let's talk about free additional health services. What are free additional performance? They are those services that the managerial staff and the health sector staff, and not only, carry out or have the right to carry out to reduce waiting lists and reduce the use of outsourcing. These services are paid with a sum that is predetermined on the basis of a corporate agreement, where trade union forces also intervene. The financial law of the State, n. 13/2023, in paragraphs 218, 219 and 220, made it possible to raise these sums, determining a maximum figure and an amount to be allocated to the regions. The Aosta Valley benefits from an amount, which is equal to 588,000 euros, of which 420 for the managerial staff and 168,000 for the sector staff. Following this determination, the regional council provides, through a resolution of the council, which was made for us in April 2024, at no. 405, to determine the destination of these sums. The junta, led by President Testalin, decided, on the proposal of the commissioner and after concertation with the trade union forces, to allocate this figure only to the staff who deal with the emergency emergency, causing a hourly compensation of 100 euros for the medical manager and at 60 euros for the healthcare staff of the health sector. With the interpellation we ask what are the reasons behind the choice to recognize expenditure commitments different times between the emergency emergency and the other departments, when the reference rule allows to proceed with the same figures in all the structures and if you intend to adapt the amounts also for the other structures where the possibility of carrying out the LPA aimed at the reduction of waiting lists and to reduce the use of the externalizations is envisaged. Thanks for the reply."

The 2023 Financial History has assigned and transferred to the Valle d'Aosta Region, in derogation from the rules of the self-financing of the regional health service, the total amount of 588,000 euros, of which 420,000 euros for the managerial staff and 168,000 euros for the medical staff of the sector for each of the years 2024-2025-2026. This overall amount constitutes the spending limit for each region and autonomous province. In the light of the aforementioned legislation, the Department, the USL company and the trade union organizations have agreed on the need to maintain the free company for the emergency and the internalizations to the value of 100 euros per hour for medical managers and the value of 60 euros per hour for healthcare personnel in the health sector up to capacity of the budget assigned. For all the other cases, the contractual standard for doctors has been applied to the minimum amount of 80 euros. This agreement has its rational in the following considerations. First of all the budget for the free corporate profession, the LPA, both the one connected to the financial and the contractual one, is defined and not derogable. In fact, an increase in the maximum value of all services would have significantly reduced the overall hours disburseable and, consequently, reduced the services obtainable for citizens. Secondly, all hours, even those remunerated at the minimum value of 80 euros per hour, have guaranteed a considerable increase in the doctors (+30%) compared to previous remuneration at Euro 60 per hour. The decree-law n. 73/2024 on the waiting lists in article 7 also provided, and she knows, for all a tax discount on the LPA hours, moving on to an IRPEF taxation of 15%, namely the substitute tax on the additional services of the health personnel, thus generating an increase in the net value paid to the workers. Urgency performances, by their nature, cannot be delayed or not paid and already provided for the treatment of 100 euros per hour. They are those for which it is necessary to give priorities and guarantee continuity to the already guaranteed compensation. The services related to internealization are also equally priority, also due to the provisions that have blocked the possibility of renewal or again announcement of outsourcing services, even in the lack of staff as you know, see article 10 of 34/2023. As an example, the third emergency room clinic and the emergency room radiology at the expiry of the contract had to be taken over by the employee. The hourly value brought to 100 euros for doctors has in fact allowed to maintain the service unchanged, passing from the throwers to the staff of the radiology structure, as, among other things, it has often been requested within this advice. Collaga remain, and she for continuous relationships with your company knows it, the operators themselves, for the sense of responsibility that distinguishes them, who wanted to give the maximum amount of 100 euros a connotation of exceptionalism. What I can tell them compared to these initiatives is also linked to the fact that his questions fit into a logical discourse that is what he does not see the workers of the sector, doctors, nurses and all the 26 health professions to work for this exceptional nature. He will agree with me that this is the approach, on which questions such as his can then be asked, which makes these tools, LP and LPA, are more tools that serve to give an answer to a very difficult management problem. Other types of settings do not catch the connection of exceptionality. In some other questions of the day it almost seems that the exceptional nature for someone wants to be the norm, but, as she points out with her question, it is not so."

The interpellation wants to highlight that, since the rule of the state, which places clear and evident limits on the basis of which you have moved, in article 118 places as a prerogative that the loan is aimed at reducing the waiting lists and the use of externation, does not place limits to the departments, but thus applying it and, I repeat, you do it in the terms of the standard, it is reduced by a part, on the other. There are equally urgent assessments, of a radiological or other type, which are not affected by the LPA or at least they cannot be interested today. The objective of the inter -apellance is to invite you to try to find a different solution, i.e. to allow to further invest in the company, the free corporate services or, by defining them in another way, on the free services within the company, so that the continuous use of companies outside Valle is avoided by Valley by the Aosta Valley, or to exteriorization, which evidently do not bring advantages for the economy, they bring damage to the environment, Health and begin to become a social problem. I believe that these four reasons are sufficient to go by derogation from certain rules or at least to request them that they want to deepen the matter, then meet the needs of the population and also encourage health professionals."
47958,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,5103,"The regional council, with resolution no. 1086 of 9 September 2024, established the political technical table and the control room for the reorganization and enhancement of the regional system of interventions and services in favor of people with disabilities. This table will have to deal in particular with the revision of law no. 14/2008. With the resolution, the procedure is also initiated to identify an external subject who will have to draw up the feasibility study for the period 2024/2025. In the text of my interpellation, a piece of the title of resolution no. 1086, I apologize. However, the will of the Region emerges from the text to reform the Aosta Valley system that concerns disability, with the support of technical assistance and is a fully shareable goal. In relation to this important intervention that there will be, in recent weeks, now a month ago and more, we have received the letter sent by one of the associations that deal with disabilities on our territory: the Family Committee 162 for the implementation of law no. 162 in Valle d'Aosta. In this letter it is reminded that ""any action of reform of the rules concerning the world of disability must take place in the wake of law no. 227/2021"" delegation to the government regarding disabilities ""and having in reference the UN Convention for the rights of people with disabilities"". These are documents that we have already had the opportunity to discuss in this classroom and we have also done it in the commissions. In addition to the aforementioned law, n. 227, it is also necessary to take into account the important implementing decrees that have been issued by the National Government, which plan to start the policies for the derication of services, those that we could define standard services, with growing attention to the forms of personalized support. It is an important change of paradigm, considered very positive for many personal situations by those who have always dealt with the protection of the rights of people with disabilities. The request that comes in this case by Committee 162 regarding the definition of the new system is a request that we know to be shared by many other associations and goes in the sense of operating so that this new system - I quote from the letter - ""is not aimed at thinking about new or better services intended as places, walls, dedicated spaces, or segregating, but is aimed at creatively designing new ways, which allow each citizen with disabilities to dispose of supports. compensate for his impairment or fragility to give concreteness to his life project in the world of all "". I think this is the objective as important as it is challenging, which expresses with great clarity the need to respect the individuality of people with disabilities and to concretely take charge of everyone's life project, a project that unfortunately many times must be reduced and revised due to obstacles deriving from an assistance system that also must be revised and enhanced. Also because, I remember it, the UN Convention, which has become the law of the Italian State, n. 162/1998, from which the association I mentioned takes its name, establishes that ""the person with disabilities has the right to choose where, with whom and how to live"". The Family Committee 162 then expresses the hope of being able to participate together with all the other bearers in the process of revision of the regional law: n. 14/2008 and, more generally, to the reorganization of the regional system of interventions and services for people with disabilities. It is true that in the resolution I mentioned, n. 1086, it is stated that the work table will also provide for representatives of the associations that deal in the region of disability, however, given that normally reference is made to the most representative associations, precisely because it is usually so, we understand a desire by this association, but also by other associations, which express the same hope, that is, that of being truly an active part of this important revision path, because we will then know that it will then have consequences on the regional system on the whole regional system. of disability. It is for these reasons that we ask the Government to know if in the assessments that led to the formulation of the resolution, the examination of law no. 227/2021 and if legislative decree n. 62 of 3 May 2024, which is specific on personalized life projects. We ask because rightly in the letter we have received we refer to the fact that in the resolution it is not mentioned. It is important to understand it because it really outlines the evaluation processes and preparation of personalized life projects in ways that are new compared to the past. The second question is: ""If there is the intention to involve the various associations that deal with disabilities in Valle d'Aosta and which intend to collaborate actively at the process of revision of the law""."

The foreseen reform of the regional law no. 14/2008 is necessary in that, beyond constituting a rather dated system? We talked about it when we talked about the Defr and I am pleased that, when it is about doing the interpellations, it is known that at least the process of reviewing no. 14 Has he left? precisely following the approval of the delegation law n. 227/2021 and the related implementing decrees, a rethinking of policies in favor of people with disabilities who is respectful of the most recent guidelines deriving both from the aforementioned national regulatory system, and, as reported by her, from the UN Convention for the rights of people with disabilities, is very urgent. In this sense, the fact that in the text of resolution no. 1086/2024 the delegation law n. 227/2024 and not the subsequent implementing legislative decrees must not be understood as a spelling of the implementing provisions but, indeed, a wanting to make those principles and purposes expressed in the delegation law its own, which is the subject of detail discipline in the decrees approved by the government. Coming to the second question, or ""if it is intention to involve the various associations that in the Aosta Valley deal with disabilities and that intend to collaborate actively at the process of revision of the regional law n. 14/2008"", I think I can affirm, as also transpires also from the resolution of the Giunta n. 1086, that this process intends to be as participated as possible, giving the wider space both to the subjects with interest and to all those who want to collaborate, as has already happened on the occasion of the launch of the regional law no. 14/2008, which already followed an absolutely participated path. It is also important to recall, but you mentioned it, that in the regional council resolution no. 1086 We speak precisely of a technical table and a control room with technical composition and that in the technical table it is expressly recalled that representatives of the associations for people with disabilities will be involved and, based on the topics covered, further subjects may also be called to participate."

When you take an interpellation, you take note that the path started and here it was not possible to do differently because the resolution is clear: the path started, we know, thank goodness, it was also written in the defr. I imagine that his introductory note made in the intervention refers in some way to the other path that started and started with a delayed burst. When things work, it is said, when they work less, it is said as much. Beyond this, the interpellation had the purpose substantially to receive reassurances and the second response she has given is actually reassuring or, better, confirms what was expected, however, since often then to participate, as happens in other areas, are the most representative associations, the concern was to be all there. It seems to me that she confirmed it, so it's definitely good news. On demand no. 1 She says: we absolutely did not want to debase the decree I mentioned, that is, the n. 62 of May 3, we included in the quotation of law no. 227 also those who were the next steps. It may be, okay. I believe that, considering the importance that that decree has, it could be mentioned, precisely because in that decree we refer very precisely and very punctually to the question of the change of the new rules that are against the extension of a personalized life project, which already existed in the past but which now has a certainly different and more important value and structuring. However, thank you for the reply."
47959,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8175,"With this initiative we discuss a theme that, unfortunately, often returns to the limelight and how, in spite of ourselves, we must take note that every occasion that in theory should serve to make a right battle against violence and I want to reiterate against any violence, anywhere arrivals and against anyone who is direct, is absolutely important. Imagine the surprise when, looking at the resolutions that came out, we see that two projects have been financed: one from the cost of 10,000 euros and the other more or less the same: 9,990 euros. The title of this initiative particularly affects me, because an initiative against violence is titled: ""Sex joy, for a non -violent affectivity"". Moreover, I also went to look at the definition of ""affectivity"" and the dictionary says: ""In dynamic complex psychology of the various feelings"". We will talk about feelings, probably, but the ""sex joy"" before left me some doubts ... (intervention of a councilor outside the microphone) ... Here, in my opinion, the will was that. We therefore made the appropriate insights to understand this project in what we consisted and we took a series of ideas of this project, which, however, also earned the title of no longer remember what a well -known page wrote to me, a well -known far -left political group. ""Andrea de Torquemada"" maybe they called me. I wanted to reassure that obviously I will continue to deserve this title. The project tells us that ""the project intends to prevent gender -based violence and eradicate sexist stereotypes thanks to targeted, popular and formative, but also artistic and cultural actions, which promote gender equality among the youngest groups of the population"". This English is beautiful because a little confuses the waters, it tries a little bit of masking in a positive way what is brought. It is said that ""the first area of ​​objectification of the woman is precisely the erotic experience"" and they write? It seems a political manifesto that of this project -: ""We want to bring to the center of the local debate that still struggle to enter the public agenda for fear and taboo, with the aim of contrasting the discriminating and patriarchal culture in which gender -based violence is rooted"". A manifesto that seems to me by reading a little ... let's go back to the topic of Trump's victory, which we took note with happiness ... The topic that some inconsolable feminists pulled out: we didn't talk enough of these things, we were unable to let this theme enter the political agenda and therefore people did not vote as we wanted, voted in a little different way, which we did not like. In short, this project tells us that ""the patriarchal cultural system in which all forms of gender violence are radically struggled to defuse themselves"". So basically the problem is the patriarchal system. I also searched for the definition of ""patriarchal"" and ""patriarchate"" and is rather curious. I will not read it because you know it well, but I certainly don't think it is the origin of all evils. Do they always write in the ""Sex Joy project, for a non -violent affectivity""? We always have this contrast between sex and affectivity, which, in my opinion, has little to do with violence?: ""The theme of sexual and emotional education places at the center of the interventions"". With this project against violence, that is, you want to make sexual education, at least this is what is said. I will not tell you the name of those who proposed it, but it is curious because they are in this association, I don't know how to define it ... it's called APS, the same characters who also make projects for the Municipality of Aosta, designs for the region always on the same topic, an inquiring of here, an inquiring. It is curious, they are always the same subjects who turn and take money. It almost seems that they live on this, that is, that their main activity is to do these projects. It is a danger, because evidently a person tends not to want to solve the problems perhaps if these problems give them to live. This is therefore another question I put on the table. Obviously I am not saying that this is the case, but in general, if this type of dissemination becomes a profession, the risk is created. These associations say that ""the project is constituted in various interventions on the issues of gender violence, sexuality and gender equality in the artistic, cultural, popular and formative fields"". There are a whole series of descriptions, which I will cut for the charity of the homeland. To point n. 3 of a list of objectives is said, among other things, that ""we want to spread the discipline of consent, opening the discussion on the future scenarios of the relationship between man and woman export"" ... ""Sporting"" is actually written and this is a mistake that unfortunately is reported in the project, you can see that it is written enough in a hurry. Moreover, here among the proposing subjects of the pages, I had it pointed out to another colleague first ... there are other errors that are particularly fun. ""Spreading the discipline of consensus, man-woman relationship, exporting the issues to combat patriarchal culture outside the so-called"" feminist bubble """". That is, we are all feminists, we must also involve men, we lead them to make this beautiful political battle. On disseminating the discipline of consent, it is not clear to me what it means: that is, it should be explained that the consent between two people goes to have an emotional relationship of the type described by the ""sex joy""? Because if this is, I have that fantastic intervention that a prosecutor did a few years ago, who told how immigrants who arrived had to explain that rape a woman was not going well, because they probably did not know. There is a video, I think we have seen many of us, that it is particularly fun and edifying if we imagine that the same people who say it must judge these types of crime. The thing that actually left me particularly thrilled is the list of results. At the end of all this beautiful project on sex, consent, on the ""sporting"" themes and anything else, that is, it has results. What are the results for which 10,000 euros were given, money from the Valle d'Aosta taxes? ""The project intends to contrast patriarchal culture and gender -based violence by offering the population opportunities for meeting and reflection on innovative issues? Cutting -edge issues, could we say? What sexuality and affectivity, gender stereotypes and stereotypes, deconstruction of patriarchal culture. In particular, among the results of the planned project there is the prevention and contrast of gender violence? Educating the younger generations of the training age to recognize and counter patriarchal culture? therefore training? So we said it. We turned around all this project, the genre violence of here, the patriarchate from there, but a nice brushstroke of rainbow we also stuck it at the end. In short, in the light of all this, councilor, I honestly did not understand ... Among other things, I apologize, for the record, among the activities that are proposed there is also ""the organization of Lofica evenings"". I don't know what the ""Lofica evenings"" are, but they are written in the project. Maybe I will make myself explain specifically what these ""Lophic evenings"" are. With the presentation that I did to you I hope to have explained to you what went to finance, unfortunately, our region and I ask you what the relevance of the project is with the purposes referred to in the introduction and if the administration is willing to carry out a better selection of the projects so that they are relevant to the purposes of the law."

In particular, article 5 of the aforementioned law defines that the Region promotes projects aimed at the realization of prevention initiatives against gender -based violence, in particular in schools and families, of education to mutual respect in the relationship between sexes, respect for sexual, religious and cultural identities, non -violence as a method of civil coexistence and provides that the anti -violence projects can provide for awareness and information campaigns regarding the theme of violence.

The evaluation of the projects, as required by paragraph 6 of article 5 of n. 4/2013, is the responsibility of the forum. The recalled project was presented by the Social Promotion Association Creatures Montane APS and the Forum itself. With reference to the expected results, it is also expected to raise awareness of a non -discriminatory and less sexist equal culture towards the woman. The project was examined by the commission provided by the forum which, in full legitimacy, positively assessed the recalled project, considering it consistent with the provisions of resolution no. 401/2023 and in line with the theme defined within the permanent forum against the harassment and gender violence."
47959,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,4405,"I took note of the painful task of the commissioner Marzi to defend the indefensible. I am close to her, councilor, I realize the improb task to which she is called, every now and then she also manages to have a motion of pride, as she did yesterday, basically not sharing what was done by the neuropsychiatry service of our region. However, I must tell you, for the next time, on some answers like these, if it manages to pretend greater enthusiasm, probably the people who support these projects will be more happy. I take note that its assessments are linked to a mere list of rules, which evidently do not cover the provisions of these projects. Beautiful exaltation that, among other things, is in the project, I repeat, it is not that there are many pages, there will be four/five, but with a lot of errors, so it means that perhaps it was more careful to perceive the funds than to write the project. As always, then what is written is one thing, what is done are very curious to know if the track also follows. The fun thing, in short, up to a certain point, is that, among other things, a show is enhanced with a track, among other things, staged here in the Aosta Valley, and not only, from a Valle d'Aosta company that is part of this let's call it ati, because they are several associations even if it is not companies, but the money perceives it and is titled: ""Having as a mother's mouth mother"". This is the title of the show. The fun and recurring thing in this document is that it is always said that the image of the woman sexualizes and this is wrong, on this we can absolutely agree, but then the show is exalted, which is titled: ""Having as a mother mouth of pink"". I do not know, we tend to the profession of mouth of Rosa we all know it, I don't know if this can have a congruence with what is enucleated in the project. However, what remains is that you write pages on pages, we try to confuse words on words, but in the end the trait is clear. There is, as colleague Perron said first, a lobby, which is a very strong lobby, a lobby that is fed by these actions, which have no intention of doing what they declare. What is done with these actions is simply an assignment and political propaganda based on this self -food. We know very well that this project has no intention of developing results of that type, but, as they wrote, to do evenings with Tiktoker who present you the petalous thing, which tell you ""Girl power, we are all strong, we are all good"", but at the gay pride maybe you are next year because we are so many, we prevent the omolesbobitransphobia, at least I think it is obviously in the law. That this is absolutely not inside, so much so that ... the colleagues will agree, the action you want to do is to insert some sections of the PL n. 64, precisely in the law that you have mentioned, therefore evidently this trait is not there but you want to put it by force the same. These results that are highlighted are not the results that we should have, we should have a structure that allows us to protect anyone who has even the fear of being the subject of violence, we should have a structure that teaches not to use violence in any case, against anyone, because violence is never the explanation, instead we have hordes of people who feed, who live on projects, who live in these things, take an assignment of the Municipality of Aosta today, tomorrow And they live exactly of this in operation for the construction of the next project, at the next cooperative, to the next management. Then maybe it happens that these same people go to manage a public space and say that the fascists cannot enter there, maybe they also put their hands on them or call the police, who knows! I, commissioner, invite you, despite not having found inconsistencies there, to make a greater reflection for the next few times and to pay more attention than what is paid with our money, otherwise sooner or later, when the government will change, perhaps these things, as has already been said, will find the closed taps."

We learned that, as part of the awareness -raising activities that were carried out in October, the Valle d'Aosta section of the Italian League for the fight against cancer launched an appeal with the request to introduce urgent and imperative measures to ensure that it can be intervened early in these situations that occur in the area. Basically two proposals are made: the first is to lower age, from 45 to 40 years, in relation to the screening that takes place on an annual basis; The second is at the same time to also start awareness within the school world to make popular activities in the area regarding this topic. Therefore with this interpellation we ask the regional government and in particular to the competent councilor if he intends to evaluate the transposition of this appeal, that is to introduce the two requests that have been made by the Valle d'Aosta section of the League against cancer."
47960,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,2943,"Thanks to her, connects Marquis. First of all, it should be noted that the screening for the early diagnosis of breast cancer ordinarily turns to women aged between 50 and 69 and is performed with a mammography every two years. In some regions the effectiveness is being experienced in a wider age group: that between 45 and 74 years old. This expansion of targets in Valle d'Aosta has already occurred since 2016. At national level, the offer of screening to women aged between 40 and 44 years of age is also being evaluated, but at the moment it does not appear that this age group has already been taken into consideration in a systematic way by any region. This enlargement is therefore the subject of analysis and comparison in the institutional tables, such as the National Screening Observatory and, consequently, we are also making the same type of evaluation in our region compared to the further expansion of the breast screening offer also to this age group. At the moment, however, it is objectively priority for the structures that deal with the screening activity implement the percentage of adhesion to the first level of mammographic screening. In this sense, we work to develop targeted communication campaigns, a greater offer in the area and a progressive digitization of the procedures of the investigation path, ranging from the convocation to the transmission of the outcome. The results published by the National Screening Observatory for 2023, albeit naturally limited, as I recalled before, given that the age in the rest of Italy is 50-69 years, to this age group, therefore excluding from the calculation all the services administered to women aged between 45 and 49 years and 70 and 74, show for the regional mammographic screening a percentage of adhesion of 47.9% on the face of a national figure of 55.4 and northern Italy of 65.5. For this reason, at the moment we believe - and we are confident that she too - priority and urgently sensitize women in the enlarged and current band to join the controls. In parallel, as mentioned, we will also work to evaluate the strengthening of the screening activity and therefore also to expand the target audience, as is required. Maybe, connects Marquis, this initiative will also help us prevent and promotion to the screening that are recalled. Coming to the question n. 2, prevention is made in more general terms than the specific topic, premature compared to the school age group. In fact, in this logic, a collaboration action with the Superintendency of Studies is being carried out, especially in the context of the Regional Prevention Plan, in order to propose secondary prevention messages to young people who should in turn be a vehicle for information and education to adults."
47960,XVI,07/11/2024,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,2026,"Thanks Councilor for the answer that has been provided to us. We have basically advanced what was the request that was proposed by the Aosta Valley section by the League against tumors. We realize the difficulty in adhesion, which is a problem that must be addressed. On this occasion, she told us about procedures, digitization, convening problems. Indeed there is all an organizational speech that hasn't found a solution for too long. We are a small region and we should be in this respect a model, because it is easier to manage small numbers than large numbers when you have to draw a management platform. Therefore we believe that it is correct to proceed with the popular and information campaign in schools, because this can be, in a context as it has been represented, an important element to create education towards attitudes that can be positive on the subject, which can then be reported by the world of school and by the young people within the family to raise awareness of the issue. We believe that the evaluation is a positive thing to do and we hope that the words you have pronounced, where it is said that this path will be assessed, are a real evaluation, that the number of people affected by this pathology in the younger age is growing as quickly as possible, because even in Valle d'Aosta. If you manage to intervene and find the problem in the initial phase, it is much easier also to be able to intervene positively and with much higher successful percentages. Moreover, a prevention made with due attention is true that it involves a more effective and more efficient organizational model from a certain point of view, but it is also true that, on the other, it then leads to achieving savings in the management of subsequent health expenditure. We therefore trust that this topic is not underestimated and is treated with due attention."
47961,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8073,"With this interpellation we return to the issue of the cost of district heating and do it by taking for example the part of public residential construction, because from there we can also have a comparison with other accommodation and between the accommodation and the previous costs and those following the flood. Now, all this comes from a series of issues. We highlighted over time, but we have always been answered by those who were tempore was councilor for social policies, the then councilor Barmasse, and also by her, Councilor Marzi, who in reality was not true, that the costs of district heating were absolutely in line, indeed they were even lower than the cost of the boilers, of the previous LPG. They were therefore all inventions. We then mentioned several articles in our benefit. An interesting journalistic deepening had been made by ""Aostasera"" on the cost of district heating, this for private condominiums, where it was highlighted that the cost of district heating was double or triple compared to the normal cost, let's call it that, of the previous heating system. Now we finally have a testimony also of a public body that takes a position on the topic, because on August 8, 2024 - and we are talking about August - a declaration from the Municipality of Aosta comes out, which says: ""Palaindoor only partially used, but the costs of the district heating doubles. The municipal council of Aosta has extended the management of the Palaindoor until 31 December 2024 to face the high costs of the heating. to heating costs "". Therefore, therefore, the fact is acknowledged, even by public part, that district heating is absolutely more expensive than the other systems. In the body of the article that reports the part of declarations that the Municipality has done, I think about the city council, it is said that, in order to cope with the high costs of heating and the economic difficulties of the management of the Palaindoor, the current management is extended until the end of the year and the Municipality comes to pay 50% of the bills, because otherwise the companies that manage it cannot face you. I think this position is evident and clarifies very well what the economic outlay is that unfortunately district heating asks. Instead, we come to another communication, even more evident, that I have already mentioned but I think it is appropriate to resume and again highlight, where the arer has thought of communicating to users an important thing. We are grateful for once because we have finally put in black and white also of the critical issues related to district heating. The arer says in a communication sent to tenants: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in past seasons"" ... and it is strange, however, that we talk about fuel, because she will know, councilor, who has done so much to tell about the fairy tale of the district heating fueled by the scraps of the Cogne, therefore a green source, indeed that we would reuse something that would be lost, I count as enchantment, in reality, district heating uses fuel. Among other things, I repeat it once and for all, because, in my opinion, it helps to understand it: not only when the hot water starts from the central and goes another part clearly to develop its effects losing the heat in its journey, it loses indicatively one or two degrees for each kilometer path and the district heating network is 50 kilometers on the city of Aosta. I make you do the calculations. Not only is the fuel use to produce that source of heating, but then there are revamping plants just to avoid the effect of the temperature loss, which use further fuel to always heat that water that had started on the other side and was already hot. All this obviously produces costs, multiplied costs. So the arer tells us: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in the past seasons and considered the probable persistence of these costs at least for the 2024-2025 season? And here the twist? Together with the possible limitation of the available fuel"". I have already said it on the occasion of the Defr, but I repeat it: do we plan that there is a war? Is there a limitation of fuel? Have the world oil reserves finished? Did the gas reserves end? Will Cogne don't work anymore? We don't know, that is, explain to us what happens. Why will there be a limitation of the fuel available? What is going on? Why does the arer write to the tenants that the fuel could end? It really seems to be in the subcanled of a ship and the hub says: ""Captain, look at the coal here, we must slow down"". I put myself in the role of a tenant who reads such a stuff. ""In the face of all this? Even the limitation of fuel? Is it recommended careful and scrupulous use of the heating of sanitary water"". Consumption continues, wash once a week, do not heat too much, because here you have to contingent. ""Both to avoid an excessive increase in individual expenses, and to reduce fuel consumption"" which, as has been said before, could scarce, indeed going to zero and here we die frozen. He will then remember Councilor a discussion on the boilers, the famous boilers, we also talked about it with his colleague Baccega, he told us that the boilers system is wrong, it is dangerous, it had to be changed, that it cannot be used. ""Buh! What a disgusting the boilers!"". Where one opened and closed and knew what he consumed, if I open consumption and I know how much consumption, I am doing it. Better district heating, which has monstrous costs, but above all an undivided part of consumption, and this is not said. There is a part of consumption that does not depend only on what I use, but a part of consumption of the condominium, which I would not have paid with my boiler, but this communication tells us: ""Only for tenants who use autonomous heating systems, boilers or alternative shapes (stoves) should it be remembered that before the start of the winter season, the tenants are required to carry out the periodic revision of the systems used and the cleaning of the smoke rods specialized "". We find at the bottom of this communication the solution to the danger of the boilers: to commit the tenants to make maintenance. A solution that we could call Colombo's egg. In the face of all this, however, we already have the first effects. I have two bills last season and the current season. Last season, the same user had had a estimate of using consumption for the 2023-2024 season of 450 euros, so in one season it was made aware of the fact that the estimate was 450 euros and that it would consume that figure. The same accommodation is connected by force, with the armigers to the door that throw you out if you do not connect, to the district heating and this year the estimate arrives, which passes from 450 euros in 2023-2024 to 1,750 euros of 2024-2025. An increase that is plastic, is in the cards and is due to the compulsory All -CAREING ALLACKING FOR ALL HUNCH. This is why, in the face of this, councilor, although almost certain that we will not get answers, if not a strenuous defense of what already put in place by the ARER we ask them: if a comparison has been made between the costs incurred before the flooding to the district heating and the subsequent ones; If so, what is the outcome of the comparison; If the negative, if intended to do so and, if there is a higher cost than the previous one, identify the appropriate methods of support for families in conditions of necessity; What are the reasons for the announced and considerable increases in the cost of fuel and also what is meant by ""limitation of the available fuel""."
47961,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,7018,"In the communication note to the users sent by the Areer to the tenants, the emphasis on the attentive and scrupulous use of heating and hot water water is placed precisely to be of help in limiting their use and, therefore, of getting to have adequate attention to expenses. Precisely because the ARER, as recalled by its presentation and also by its initiative, in reality not only plays the role of condominium administrator, but also of the subject involved in the management of the socio-habitative distress. Normally a landlord, a condominium administrator, who is rented or in ownership, does not send this kind of communication to the tenants: this applies precisely because the arer actually also performs that type of service. The Department also requested the comparison data between the costs incurred before the flooding to the district heating and subsequent ones and is not an increased cost for users linked to district heating compared to the previous or alternative supplies, nor the 2021-2022 season, nor the 2022-2023 season, therefore not even the 2023-2024 season. A contract with the company Telcha has been stipulated to the maximum protection of its tenants, which guarantees the maintenance of the agreed economic convenience over time, equal to 16.64%, compared to the other alternative sources available on the market, with particular reference to the price of the gas in relation to the overall cost. Therefore independently of the private dynamics that may exist between a public structure, managed by a subject, and the district heating company, which you have mentioned in the presentation of the initiative, this does not concern the dedicated relationships and that we have repeatedly recalled both I and colleague Barmasse, who exist between Aret and Telcha. Not because it is not the task of the public to reason with respect to those who provide district heating, but that does not concern the initiative because the relationships that bind the ARER in Telcha are relationships that must maintain within some cost parameters, in favor of those who live in the housing emergency or in the public housing of reference. The estimates of consumption for the 2024-2025 season are drawn up on the basis of the finals of the 2023-2024 season and report, in general, an average decrease in costs of about 14% of all ARER buildings linked to the district heating. The only increasing forecasts concern the buildings called the Filipino and Stura, in the Cogne district, whose connection will be starting from the 2024-2025 season: therefore, inevitably, it has increased for the simple fact that the heating was not included in the estimate before. As already mentioned, the unit costs are guaranteed the most competitive possible, however the overall cost of the heating also depends, of course, on the consumption of the tenants. In the specific case it is also useful to report the data that I now represent. Below is the expense for buildings connected to district heating, with the comparison of the last three thermal seasons. After the anomalous increase in the 2021-2022 season, there was a significant reduction in costs already the following season and there is a further reduction for the season just ended. In fact, compared to a 2021-2022 season of 1,071,499 euros, already last year in the 2022-2023 season there had been a drop of 20.29% on average, thus going to 854,000 euros. At this moment there has been a further drop of 14%, as recalled a few earlier, which brings the total costs of the condominiums linked to 734,000 euros. As regards all the topic with respect to water and water management, even that is part of a dynamic between a subject responsible for participating in the system of socio-habitative discomfort and their tenants, because in fact in the management of public spaces, therefore also of public housing, there are parameters and objectives that are given to those who manage public spaces that are also related to the use of water and energy efficiency. It is important, connecting Manfrin, compared to the story and the countless initiatives that will continue to exist, where in fact I and I do not have to discuss, rather confront each other, regarding what the colleague Lucianaz recalled yesterday afternoon compared to a direct line, in reality the direct line exists on issues. Of course, she carries on certain types of instances and we try to represent the complexity of such a large management. But I have already told him once and I repeat it: the history of difficulties in terms of costs compared to the tools used to heat the popular houses of the Cogne district, especially, is a story older than me and her. It is a story that in history has seen, in the course of the last twenty -five years, ""n"" thousand minority councilors, ""n"" thousand administrators, who have tried to represent, whatever the choice made to heat the houses of the Cogne district, by those who collect the right instances of the inhabitants of the protests because they were too dear and, in fact, to find solutions. Whenever the solutions that were expected the next tool that was criticized as a tool too expensive for the management of public housing was found to be found, it was the one that was previously anegated. Here is the Baccega colleague who will remember the ""N"" discussions in the city council with the then deputy mayor compared to the theme of the boilers and heating tools of the same public housing that we are talking about today. At that moment the boilers and all sorts of another type of heating tool anelated were replaced, with all the delays of the case, by district heating. Then it started to protest because the district heating was not connected in the fastest way possible. Just go on the internet today and there are some infinite discussions between the then deputy mayor and a colleague, which we all know. Today we are at the same point as regards district heating, even if district heating, among other things, in some cases has also been brought by some minority colleagues, represents from this point of view, not because it is the best of the solutions, but for the specific relationships that exist between the company that provides it and arer, which are expressly dedicated to Arer, a less expensive tool than other forms of heating today on the market. With this I know she will not be happy. The fuel I believe that in fact it is another of the tools for which arer is to communicate ... In my humble opinion, that part on the old communication is a refusal, but I will make him note. In my opinion, it is still a typo of the old equal communication that had been sent last year. However, I make them the reference."
47961,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,4661,"Thanks councilor for your reply that, as she predicted, evidently does not agree with us, but it is not that it does not see us in agreement for a question of a party taken. I thank you for the answers she wanted to provide and obviously I also imagine what is the painful task that you are responsible for each time. I believe there is a reasoning at the base. What is the point? The point is that today we are dealing, in particular for public residential construction, but it is not only this, because, as I have highlighted several times, the problem of costs concerns and also involves private condominiums. I had experiences of people who connected their condominium and evidently a minute later they regretted when the first bills arrived, but this is a private experience. Having said that, what is the question? The principle is this, councilor. I understand, and she is perfectly right, often politics seek a staple, something to be able to discuss and above all give reason to the interlocutor who is raising a problem. However, as I said, I actually have the comparison between the first and the after, but I believe that this is not even the choice, the problem and the question. I believe that the problem, the question on which this issue of costs has not been digested was the imposition. The imposition generates a dispute. If the people had been put in the condition of choosing whether to tie themselves to the district heating or keep the old heating system, I believe that all this would have been digested better. I will tell you more, councilor: the people who have been threatened - I brought him several times within this advice - that if they had not allowed the workers to enter the accommodation they would have been slammed out of the house, they made an extra move. Because rightly it was told: well, this is considered an improvement in accommodation, so you are obliged to let the workers enter. Well, let's get them in. But I keep my old system. I make you do all the connections you want, I keep my old system, which I make the appropriate checks and use that, not even that has been allowed. In a dangerous way they said: ""Woe to you, we are seeing that you are not consuming with the district heating, woe to you. Close, remove your system immediately"". This is not a motivation for costs or not costs, this really seems to be a vindictive issue: ""Ah yes, it doesn't allow me to do what I want? Ah yes, don't it allow me? Don't you use the system I gave you? Then I am enough for you"". This is deeply wrong. After that, a matter of costs. She says she is not a more expensive system. Let's say that I believe them and she is in good faith, rightly. I don't know if you had a comparison or if he actually had bills, because I would not trust the tables that give me, a Excel table made by a surveyor who tells me: the cost first was so and then the cost was this. This is a manipulation, in the sense that one cost and another are manipulated by one person. I would ask: sorry, do you give me the historian of a bill of that accommodation of 2021 and 2024? It is something tomb, if there is an increase, it is clear that I will detect an increase, I read it. Since, I repeat, I don't know if this has it, but I think they made her a summary table, but she should trust. You do not want to trust what I tell you and what I show them, at least he trusts the statements of the Municipality of Aosta. It is the municipality of Aosta itself that says: ""Palaindoor is only partially used, but the costs of the district heating double"". The Municipality of Aosta says so, I don't say it. Why the Municipality of Aosta detects a doubling of the cost of heating and the arer right? Do they use two different districts? No, because we are in a monopoly regime, the monopolist is one, it provides everything. There is therefore, understands, a discrepancy on this: either they increase for everyone or do not increase for anyone. You say that there are some favor prices regarding the arer: I take note of it, but in reality the bills say that You may possibly and rightly modify and motivate what she considers most appropriate, but this is not a political point, unfortunately this is a fact. I hope you can pay the attention due to what I have said and I hope that sooner or later, sooner or later, people can give freedom to people to warm up as the hell prefer."

This emerges from a report released ten days ago presented in Rome. The data refer to 2023 The same for Ecodoppler, eye visits in class B, hip prostheses, etc. The 7.6 of citizens gave up care, almost 1% more than 2022 and almost 2 out of 3, 4.5%, they do it precisely because of the long waiting lists. The share of renunciation between women is higher than men. I presented this initiative some time ago, councilor, because rightly Valley citizens, as it can well imagine, as often and willingly feel in this classroom, ask for information and clarifications. How is the situation in the Aosta Valley? According to an AGENAS detection relating to the relationship between visits paid in ordinary form and those in Intramoenia, in the course of 2022, which seems to be the last available data, the Valle d'Aosta region has once again recorded one of the indicators that defines itself as the most critical of Italy: in the face of 87% of ordinary visits, in Intramoenia it is reached 12.25%. The specialist visits in intramural mode, therefore outside the normal working hours of the doctors, have a much lower waiting time than the ordinary one. Here, I imagine, because it is preferred by the Aosta Valley, concrete people, who when they have an emergency, a need, see to face it as soon as he can. Of course, this is not for all budgets and in fact it is not so easy for anyone to access this service. Fortunately, however, that the situation in Valle d'Aosta of the expected lists is less serious than elsewhere, this fact can certainly contribute. I do not go further, also because in the inspection act I filled with popular rhetoric, where she certainly excels me compared to me, so I don't go further. The initiative was to provide the Valley public opinion some data and the terms of the question of what the intramural profession affects, in fact, in the Valle d'Aosta healthcare."
47962,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,7716,"To want to excel immediately in the art of dialectics, the first thing that comes to tell me about the initiative no. 80 is to agree with his new group colleague, the colleague remain, compared to the LPA, because he claims that the LPA should be given more enlargedly and she, in n. 80, claims that the LPA must be numbered in a different way. Now we will try to explain some aspects. The phenomenon of waiting lists, as we have already had the opportunity to share on several occasions, is the main health problem perceived not only by our community, but by the entire population on the national territory. This is a topic that, as is known, is continuously brought to the attention of the information bodies, even if most of the time the information provided is aimed more to make noise than to give correct indications and solutions to citizens. With this I don't speak of her, I connect Lucianaz, but I speak precisely of those who use this tool to distract. We reiterate once again how the problem is substantially linked to the lack of doctors and therefore to the difference between supply and demand for performance. Therefore it is clear that, beyond the punctual theme recalled in the initiative, this widespread problem will exist until national level will not be identified to find these figures, even with an important reinterpretation of the contracts of the sector. For years, the concrete commitment made together with the USL company has been aimed at banning numerous competitions, carrying out conventions and pursuing collaborations with other regional realities. In this sense, the data that the USL company communicates relating to the participation of the competitions have been the subject of comparison in the classroom several times. Precisely because the phenomenon is dated over the years and heavily involves the entire national territory, the government in office, at the gates of last summer, has issued a special decree-law, of which we have already talked in the classroom on several occasions, the last time in July 2024, recognizing its structural dimension in the national health service. To implement the various rules on the topic, we were forced, with resolution of the regional council n. 1185 of 30 September 2024, to approve the institution of the central management unit of health care and the times and waiting lists, made up of professionals of the health and administrative area. We are therefore following all the obligations envisaged by the national standard on the matter, as well as the activation of the national platform of the waiting lists and lastly the appointment of the sole manager of regional health care that took place in late October. Pending this activation, Agenas, which you have called back, will activate a new flow of data relating to the specialist services that will replace the current one from 1 January 2025. In addition, the USL company has already revisited the discipline of protection courses which provides that the clients who cannot be paid the visits to the prescribed times are proposed by the company itself alternative solutions, mediating additional activities organized by the company, or through the appeal always with the only payment of the ticket of the accredited private individual. We now respond to the precise points of his initiative. Point 1: ""How many doctors of local health care that operate in the intramoenia regime and where they operate"". Intramoenia is called LPI. The doctors of the USL company that carry out activities under the free profession Intramoenia - and therefore outpatient and surgical - are 158 out of a total of 297, practically only half. The same exercise this activity at the various company structures, then the Umberto Parini hospital, the Beauregard and the structures of via Guido Rey n. 3, the so -called ""polychers"". We also remember that that structure where, in fact, the intramoenia activity was centralized was one of the various things required in the various regulations that have been chased over the decades for the management of the waiting lists which provided that the intramoenia activities were all centralized in one place. The Valle d'Aosta Autonomous Region was perhaps the only one or one of the very few regions in Italy to try to manage waiting lists in one of the various decrees that have followed each other during the last twenty -five years for the management of the theme. We come to question no. 2 ""How many visits to the freelance regime were made in 2023 and divided by specialist visit or other visits"". As regards the number of services carried out during the year 2023, in the impossibility of listing in detail the important amount of data, the performance project that finds their source in monitoring Agenas, which she will already have and, if you do not have it, will provide it, we will provide it, because it is a public prospectus on which, regarding the latter regulatory variant, you also arrive at this file, is available through an email. Among other things, in this prospect we are on the average of the non -solution of the problem and only in four cases a little worse. ""How many institutional hours carried out every single doctor adhering to intramoenia and how many has carried out it as a freelance profession"": the evaluation of the relationships between institutional activities, therefore the ordinary one, and the activity in free profession Intromoenia, which the latest national rules on waiting lists have brought to attention, has always been monitored by the USL company. The comparison is carried out between volumes of services provided for team. We therefore confirm that the report is maintained, as is detectable by the data provided. The institutional activity is always superior to that intramoenia because on this point it is useful to specify that the institutional employment relationship provides 38 hours per week, while the freelance activity does not exceed on average 10 hours per week. ""What actions intends to adopt the competent councilor in concert with the health company with respect to the last aspects"": as we have already highlighted, the USL company has always guaranteed compliance with the relationship between institutional activities and intramoenia activities. There are several actions aimed at encouraging staff to provide activities in the institutional field, also by means of works remunerated by free business profession, which is LPA, referred to in initiative no. 73 of the colleague remain. The object of the dispute, in my humble opinion - and with this there is absolutely no desire not to appreciate the initiative no. 80 - is linked to the fact - and we will also have an opportunity compared to n. 81 to intervene on the merits - to take into consideration what to date are the three main problems that public Italian healthcare has: the first is the number of professionals, of any feature, therefore both medical professionals and the other 26 health professionals; The second is the financing of the public health service; The third are the waiting lists. The waiting lists between these three gigantic problems are naturally the most hated by the population, as I already had the opportunity to declare in July, but I am not doing only me, otherwise the national government, which has just transformed a decree into law, would not be re -editing another decree to manage the theme. The problem of waiting lists is a problem apart from the Italian public health service, including the regional one. It is the most hated by everyone and it is that, alas, that has less solution than everyone."

I had asked her a little more specific questions, oh well we will see this file what we can get. What is the man of the street wonders, how am I? Without being a mouth of Rosa, but am I from the road too?, is it that perhaps the monopoly regime hurts a company, because, if the problem has been pandemic and has been dragging for years or for decades, probably not the subordinates, but someone at the top of some organization problems if he has to ask it. I recently heard a primary who complains about spending more time making administration than his profession as a doctor. These structures probably have too high an administrative load, we have more officials in the offices than in the corridors ... I don't know, but certainly thanks to those who, it is strange to say it, I work in the intramoenia regime, which, if nothing else, lightens. It looks like a paradox, but thanks to these, the lists are certainly lightened. With goodwill you can certainly do more. I start from the environmental conditions of this hospital, which are certainly not optimal, instead someone seems that this is the case and for the next decades it will still be like this. However, I repeat that a company should also find all possible forces and energies inside and I would say that they are welcome, that they renew, that this machine is decidedly efficient. Good job to those who are at the top of the structure then."

The picture of our region is not very edifying compared to this relationship, but, as often then we are represented in this classroom, those data do not represent reality or at least this is what we are told. In some way we would therefore like to understand from the commissioner and we highlighted some salient issues. First of all, the report highlights that the Aosta Valley underwent a percentage drop of 27% of the total services provided in 2023 compared to 2019, resulting in the second worst figure of Italy. He underlines how this reflects a worsening of access and efficiency of the health service. Then there is a worsening of waiting times, theme already treated in a last interpellation. In the report, a particularly significant increase in waiting times is underlined for the oncological area, with a worsening of 17.74% between 2019 and 2022 Instead, there is a focus with respect to the use of freelance professional activity, of which we talked a little while ago. The Aosta Valley is the second region with a higher percentage of hospitalization services provided in a freelance for institutional ones: 0.5%, equal to 83 services out of 18,000. This could indicate, however we ask the commissioner, a more frequent appeal to paid services to make up for shortcomings in public health. Then there is also a difference between the prescribed and provided performances. The Aosta Valley also has the highest percentage: 28% of discrepancy between the prescribed and actually provided performances, also signal this of a difficulty in the system in ensuring all the prescribed treatments. This report, also compared with what has been reported and with what has been made by IRES in the analysis that the SPI CGIL delivered us, also highlights here those critical issues that we have somehow widely discussed. We then believe that both citizenship, that the SPI CGIL have somehow have a certain capillarity on our territory and that in some way the fact that these problems are reported I think it is first made to try to have answers and above all to encourage improvements in some way. In light of all this, we ask the commissioner if the aforementioned analyzes, therefore those especially of the citizenship relationship, correspond to reality and what actions have been put in place or intend to propose to improve the health system."
47963,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,10158,"I answer both questions jointly. First of all, it is important to understand two issues. The first is that the civic relationship on citizenship health always performs the analysis on the usual data relating to 2022 and in some cases on the data relating to the first half of 2023. It is a normal delay in national relationships, but it is necessary to take this into account. It is also good to specify that very often these relationships are drawn up all starting from the same sources, such as, for example, the evaluation of the Lea or the new guarantee system. Every time a report is published, a new initiative is presented, but every time it is presented as if it were new data or updated data, but the data on the essential levels of assistance relating to 2022 are always the same. For the umpteenth time we therefore analyze them and explain them. We thank you, therefore, for giving us again the possibility of telling the great commitment and all the attention that both the Department that the USL company are investing to improve and enhance both the quality of the data and information that is disclosed and the services provided. I think the 2022 data will be at least the sixth or seventh time we analyze them in the classroom. Fortunately, in the meantime they are improving. As I anticipated, I confirm that we have already had amply way of commenting on the data reported to the attention and these were certainly an important starting point for reflection to start the improvement actions. Today we can therefore update the situation and report a value closer to us than the information published and referred to 2022, or at the beginning of 2023. Coming to the second question that we want to bring to attention, also this already illustrated in this classroom, concerns the theme, for years never been examined, of what we faithfully describe the health care activity that we supply. It is called the quality of the data and concerns both the completeness of the information included in the information flow, and to the correctness and congruence of the data in terms of exact rules and codes. This, for example, since I mentioned just that it is the umpteenth time that we deal with the theme, was the subject of an initiative by colleague aggravation. On this last point you already know that we have been investing for some time, both through the establishment of the information flows office at the Department, since 2023, and through a special working group provided for by the Plan of Health and Social Wellness and subject to specific action also in the annual operational program, that is, the POA 2024, of the health and social well -being plan for card no. 20, approved with resolution no. 622/2024. The working group is addressing the qualitative question of the flow, as well as the performance of health care, identifying the areas to be enhanced and proposing contrasting action with the collaboration of reference clinicians. Coming specifically to the issues he asked, reported in the premises of the interpellation, compared to the decline of 23% the decline, as you certainly know, was attributable to the difficulty of finding the necessary professions. Here we come to initiative no. 80 of colleague Lucianaz a little earlier. The lack of specialist doctors, technicians and nurses above all condition the outpatient services as the available human resources are obviously oriented priority on urgency, then to ensure coverage in the hospitalization departments and subsequently, with the residual resources, obviously respecting the work shifts imposed by the USL, on outpatient outdoor performance. However, the increase in hiring has already made it possible to recover part of the services considered and in fact the same data of the first half of 2023, compared with 2022, recorded a +4.1%, which rises to a +7.5% if we consider all the specialist performance. This is despite the fact that the new hires have been destined to naturally and primarily recover the volumes for hospitalization activities. Specifically, the operating activity also exceeded more than 25% in 2023 that of 2019 and in the first months of 2024 it recorded an additional +11%. Coming to the other question, on the highest worsening of waiting times, in addition to referring to a figure two years ago, we inform that the complex structure oncology and oncological hematology of the Parini hospital in Aosta recorded in 2023 an increase in performance of 22% and the trend is also confirmed by the partial data of this year. The reception and services center (CAS) also guarantees patients quick access to care and the first visits are ensured within five working days. After a drop in activity in the years 2020 and 2021, in conjunction of the pandemic, since 2022 the oncological activity has started to grow again, recording in 2023 861 shelters with 11,456 days of decency. The trend is also confirmed this year, the numbers of the first semester of 2024 are in line with those of 2023. ""The second region with the highest percentage of liberal profession hospitalizations"". As is known, the small numbers have high variability. In fact, over the years, especially the last ones, the value has oscillated between 02 and 05 In relationship with the institutional activity, they have always shown full respect in the Aosta Valley of the relationships between the volumes of the two cases of activity. Coming to the highest percentage of services actually provided with respect to those envisaged, partly applies to what was reported in response to the first issue, partly the considerations that are a must in order to appropriate the services are worth. The number of performance per inhabitant is higher than the average, index of the existence of margins of recovery of prescriptive appropriateness, on which we are working. Coming to the last question and that is the discrepancy between high health expenditure and the goals obtained in terms of covering the question, she, connects Guichardaz, the first thing she must consider to me is that it is never, it was not so, the thing that everyone would be saying to us is that we do not put enough resources on public health. Instead, we come to the object of analysis of this data. First of all, I quoted it just before responding to colleague Lucianaz to interpellation n. 80, the problems of the public health service today in Italy are always the same three above. We clear the waiting lists, because I clearly said above and it is not the first time that I say it. Instead, we remain on two dramatic issues, but on which we can try to do something: the first is the number of 360 -degree professionals, from doctors to all the expected health professionals, and the second is the financing of the public health service that at the moment in Italy is the subject of a very well -being comparison between the central state and all the regions, I am not explaining why. In Valle d'Aosta this problem, with extreme sacrifices from everyone, is not there and will not be even for the next few years, because the reference data on which we have tried to stabilize the health expenditure in the coming years compared to the financial coverage of the Lea, you will see it in the next forecast budget, it will certainly be the object of more in -depth comparison in the classroom. However, it is important to say that what we have tried to do with the next budget on health expenditure is coverage and stabilization on the whole three years of the same figure as regards the essential levels of assistance. In the current forecasting, that 2024-2025-2026, the reference expenditure for the coverage of the essential levels of assistance on 2024 was 277 million, and then was 270 million on 2025 and 266 million on 2026. Also simply this discrepancy between the first year of the old budget compared to the second annuity, always of the old-time budget, created problems, for example, to the USL company for the USL company for the company preparation of its budget. Of course, in 2024 she has to make the budget for 2025, in 2023 she had to do it for 2024 and so we can go on. Having figures on the second year of the lowest three -year of those of the current year, there were always problems, so often it was derogated with the budget not allowing the USL company of the Aosta Valley to have its own budget approved on January 1 of the following year. With the stabilization that we are making essential levels of assistance over the three -year period, even growing, that is, to 278 million euros, in fact we are guaranteeing a stabilization of the health coverage, so the first thing we must all tell each other is that with everyone's sacrifice, with an analysis of everyone, because so much these things here, I can assure you, I tell you here but I am not particularly merit, ""But if you put the money, because I can't make a visit in a day, two days, three days"" and so on. I say this to a common factor because the object of the dispute is that and they ask me continuously. Since we are responsible for the work of being the administrator, therefore to make also programming and strategic choices, compared to the last question of his initiative, it is absolutely important to represent this. Of all this the guarantee of the expenditure on Title II on investments is also connected. I think we are one of the few unique local health companies to guarantee a financing of 6,650,000 euros every year, therefore this, regardless of what would seem to be discrepancies between what we invest and what we get, is actually a positive thing for our health."

Of course, they are the same data, but they always add new ones: for example, the performances actually provided with respect to those prescribed, I had not seen in the Agenas report. This is an example. Also on this, councilor, she knows it very well because we have also been in the majority together and we have widely discussed it, but one of the priorities that put our political strength in the field was the question of the Observatory, but not for our gap, because every time we go to clash with that data and evidently, if none of us understand them, because today it is my initiative, of the director Lucianaz, and so on, but in every advice there is a problem. Councilor, with whom she has to start dealing. Above all - this I say it in every location and in every place - we certainly cannot say that there is no money and it is also written in the premises of my interpellation, because we cannot actually say that money in the budget is not put. Allow me, however - then we will return to the next initiative of the J.B. Festoz, who is perhaps even easier to understand being a small reality -, if you go from 2 to 5 million and if the quality of the service worsens and people leave, can we ask a question? Can we ask ourselves why, increasing resources so much, in the end we arrive at these conclusions? Evidently the results are not seen and, from this point of view, even on the waiting lists, it allows me, those floating lists make the urticaria come to all those who call the Cup and say to them: ""You are put in the floating"", which means: wait, hope and you will never have the opportunity to be visited. This is what people perceive. After that for you it is a sensible thing, continue to do it, but that's not how given actual answers to people. Look, councilor, I was wrong, I didn't send her the video I spoke to her yesterday, but I send it to him. If you say to a person who expects an operation of an hernia when he has a high priority: ""You have to wait a year"" and then, by calling a private clinic, it is said to him: ""They are 6,000 euros but we can get in agreement, maybe there are 3,000"", here there is a problem. After that maybe she will tell me that she is a false interview and this, in my opinion, should be reported, because, if these things come out in newspapers and national broadcasts, on the one hand there is still a return of image to the Aosta Valley which is not positive. I tell him because, unfortunately, in my life I also had people next to me with serious disabilities and even just in the choice of where to go on vacation the first thing you looked at it was if you were close to a hospital and as the health system of that region was. They were the first choices on which we went to identify the region to go on vacation. I tell you, councilor, in my opinion, take these initiatives as initiatives that somehow want to help and certainly not always put the Aosta Valley health care on the cross, which we know very well makes enormous efforts."

We learned of a note that the freelance family nanny sent to the regional administration, to the offices of the regional administration, in essence. Tate ask to have an increase in the Tata-Uttenti numerical relationship, which is currently one to four. They come to this request after a series of evaluations and comparisons with other realities. I tell you that five children are authorized in the province of Trento, therefore one more user; Six children are authorized in Veneto for the Tate; In Valle d'Aosta there are four of them and, where there is the son of a nanny over 3 years old, the fourth child is also allowed, but the service must be managed by the mother ... the fifth child. Obviously it was a service for us always of excellence, a service also developed in the area, which allowed the Aosta Valley to reside in the mountains and to have those who provided a service provided, of great professionalism, organizational skills, people with a strong sense of responsibility, who had as its objective the well -being of children. Other services similar to this also have the same objectives and perform the service equal. It must be said, however, that, for example, the nest service enjoys a user-educator or nanny relationship that is one to eight, therefore considerably higher. You understand that the balance at the end of the month is completely different. Why did the Tate arrive at this request? Obviously because there have been a series of changes over time, for example, the early insertion to the kindergarten of small users, therefore anticipated of months, means that small users who use the Tata service at the end of the year leave the service and the nanny from four users drops to three. If maybe at the same time one of these children is taken only part time, the nanny has a further hole, so you understand that the revenues are always minor. The being able to increase, at least as they underline, of a unit, if not two, would allow to rebalance the financial accounts within the service offered. I believe it is coming or has already arrived a further request from the Tate, always to the offices of the Region, who ask for an adjustment of the straight line that the parents of these children must pay to the family nanny service, to bring it closer to the fee that is paid for the nest service. Obviously on the one hand, with the same Isee, you pay a straight line of 272 euros and on the other 487 euros, so there is a substantial difference, beyond what is given by the Region. There is also a further request, which is that concerning the recognition of the meal voucher, which is 1 euro. Use, use local products, the snack is free, the meal is given only at 1 euro, it seems a little little for all this, in order to continue to provide a service of this type. Unless the political choice is completely different, we all go to work in the nursery school and, since someone says it will be free, we provide the free nursery service. However, it is a political choice that must be manifested. What is substantially asked, councilor, in the end, is if you want to evaluate and meet these requests, or if you intend to take a different path."

To save time for everyone, so I believe that it will be absolutely satisfied with the interpellation and also of the sources that have represented them more than the Councilor for reference knows."

47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,4873,"This morning the colleagues aggravated and Manfrin dealt with the issue of the proclamation of the state of agitation compared to the J.B. Festoz, here we go to take a subsequent step in addition to the requests they brought by them and that is why, by mutual agreement, we had decided not to insert this interpellation. As for the question of the expansion of the Parini hospital, I believe that the position of our regional group with respect to the issue of the J.B. Festoz is known, that is, we said to us contrary to the movement of the RSA and the UP to Variney because we were convinced that that shift would have led to a worsening of the service, which then occurred, so much so that it should even put a commission to verify the state of the art and then because there was also an extension, but on the other hand because we thought it was wrong that people with a certain experience went to occupy places in the hospital community. In some way, during the many interpellations that followed in those months of July and August 2023, we had started to say that we seemed a little the game of the three cards, where at a certain point I move the RSA to Variney and outsourced, I move who was in the RSA in the hospital, I free myself at this point the community hospital and then who knows that the community hospital or somehow the hospital. even those to an extension. This was a bit the picture that we had done during that period, so we had insisted, for example, on intercompartial mobility, because we knew that it had already been used, as has been confirmed in different interpellations by her, we knew that there was the possibility, therefore, if in some way we decide to send people to the hospital, meanwhile, in our opinion, had to be asked to all those of the nursing home, and not only a part, We had been meaning that there was a group, this group wanted to go together and this group wanted to return everything together. This is a bit the synthesis of what happened. Meanwhile, the work of the community hospital began, in some way they are also proceeding, there was also the addition of the water columns, as she remembered today during the morning, then in some way it went on from that point of view. Now we are almost coming to the point, because I seem to remember that however he had said that the community hospital opened in 2025 and 2025 is upon us, however there is also a time span in which the movement of the people who are in the hospital ... must be welcomed again in the community hospital. With this interpellation as the first point we ask for the state of art compared to the opening times of the new community hospital and also therefore the coincidence of the end of the duration of the temporary assignment of the staff, or when we intend to open the hospital and when this staff falls within the structure of the J.B. Festoz. In the meantime, however, we have analyzed the various resolutions that are coming out over time and we realized that calls were made - she had also mentioned it - for the OSS or nursing staff, but in some of the premises we found something a little strange, that is, that people in the ranking, with reached limits of 36 months of work, are not considered. Although we know there are vacant places, we go on, or even going towards an intermineing agency. The other question is therefore if it corresponds to the truth that of the operators with 36 months at the J.B. Festoz have not been hired. Already this morning the director Manfrin asked with respect to the question of the organic equipment, to the fact that we also saw that there was a place in the concierge service and that this was not covered by personnel with limitations. Today she has already given an answer, so see her whether to reply or avoid it. Certainly what I say is that, in the event that there should be a mobility, at this point it would completely fall as much as last time, that is, that that staff could not be recovered within the structure, because we can very well move it to the hospital. There are many places available, so as we can safely move the staff without limitations we can very well move the staff with limitations. Then we ask you for developments with respect to the state of agitation. Today he has already told us that it seems not to have been an agreement, but we wanted to understand better, also because he said he had been summoned and then he did not show up, I seem to have understood that. We would therefore like to better understand this part compared to the state of agitation organized by the unions."
47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,9357,"In the first instance, he connects Guichardaz, as he was also said to his colleague, the presentation of his interpellation - but this as usual and also giving it to the merit - shows that she already has much more than I can give it in terms of information, so she absolutely makes rhetorical questions to which she already has the answers. Especially then because, in reality, also with respect to questions no. 54 and n. 55 of this morning, we have provided a whole series of information. I start from the end. I did not say that I did not introduce myself to conciliation: I said that I cannot present myself in conciliation because in conciliation, at the prefecture offices, in these cases the councilors cannot present themselves. Despite this, however, I met the trade union representatives on October 29 in a very articulated meeting, which lasted two hours, in which I answered all the questions that were asked and we perceived, is in the verbal, a satisfaction from the trade union representatives also compared to all the data that asked us that basically then they were nothing more than the financial data that I represented in the response of n. 54 and n. 55. What financial data were they wondered? I was asked for the amount of the annual contribution for maximum 30% of the costs, pursuant to article 12 of n. 34/2004. I represented this morning that it went from a contribution, pursuant to article 12 of n. 34/2004, of 860,000 euros in 2018 to the current 1,600,000 euros. I was then asked what is the contribution regarding the capital share: it was 1,874,000 euros in 2018, it is 2,600,000 euros to today, also because it has gone from a capital fee of 115 euros for the protected ... of 125 euros for protected at a current capital fee of 130 euros for protected and of 140 euros as regards protected plus, therefore naturally grew. Then there are of course extraordinary contributions regarding current expenses, for example the current 750,000 euros for what is the discussion of the contribution to the contractual expenses, increasing as regards this sector. It was made for the other local authorities, it was also made for the Jean Boniface Festaz. I recalled the extraordinary contribution for investments of 500,000 euros as regards the columns of water, following the inspection required by you to go and watch the community hospital in finding this type of problems that have promptly been transferred. All this means that in all respects we have gone from a transfer to the Jean Boniface Festaz of 2,734,000 euros, contributions included in 2018, to the current 5,220,000 euros. If this is then transformed into a minutage rendered in favor of elderly people in difficulty at the Jean Boniface Festaz, to date we are Recordmen in this sense at regional level, with absolute respect for the minute for people in difficulty at this structure. Of course, if you also go to transform all this into capital, also in this sense the Jean Boniface Festaz is absolutely the structure in Valle d'Aosta which more respects this kind of parameters. Of course, once a 120 -minute analysis has been made, ... two hours compared to the current 10, you will understand that there has been a chance to deepen the theme in an absolute way. We come to his questions, because otherwise, after I have them for the umpteenth time I represented everything in reply, he tells me that I have not answered them punctually to every single question. We therefore come to response n. 1, which is the state of the art compared to the opening times of the new community hospital. The PNRR, which financed the community hospital at Jean Boniface Festaz, provides that the structure opens in the spring of 2026. About the construction we can report that the completion works inherent in the entrance area and the gym are underway, while the department is already almost finished, thus respecting the times and providing for the delivery and implementation of all the furnishings. Coming to the question n. 2 ""If it is true that the social-health operators employed for 36 months at the Jean Boniface Festaz have not been hired despite the many vacancies"": the company reports that there are six vacant figures of a socio-health worker in the service of the retirement home as regards the current modification of the organic plant, however it is to be clarified that four of these remain temporarily covered by the person 2023 to the IRS and UAP socio-health service, which is not temporarily passed through the USL company. These four OSS staff units will be assigned to the community hospital when the same will be at Festaz. It is only at that moment that in fact they will become free the four positions of OSS at the retirement home, because to date these people are working within the Festaz in the other departments. To date, therefore, unlike what has been sustained, the vacant places for the OSS figures are actually in the number of two and not six. It is also good to specify that the Jean Boniface Festaz company in the second half of 2023 stabilized with full -time and indeterminate 10 OSS contract, drastically reducing the vacant positions which in turn are covered with certain times. The positions temporarily covered by fixed -term staff are linked, among other things, to replacement contracts for long absences of personnel personnel. It is to be clarified that none of the operators in question has or will reach with the existing relationships more than the 36 months of service that you mention. Taking note of the definitive approval of the organic plant, the Festaz board has decided to authorize the director to the full -time and indeterminate hiring of n. 2 OSS, in order to hold the only two vacant positions which are actually present, as we have highlighted. Therefore, at the outcome of this, there will not be until the opening of the Hospital of Community OSS Positions not occupied by permanent personnel. Coming to the question n. 3 ""If the vacant staff present in the organic equipment to be assigned to the function of the Festaz has been proposed to the staff with limitations"", the company reports that there are currently no vacant positions in the concierge service, as also recalled to the questions (points n. 54 and n. 55) this morning. Coming to the question n. 4 ""The developments of the state of agitation proclaimed by all the Aosta Valley unions with the explicit of the Administration's intentions to try to reinstate a collaborative climate"", as already clarified and recalled this morning, discussing the questions, the regional offices of the competent prefecture services, regarding the management of the conciliation attempt established by unions towards the Festaz nursing home, have communicated Attempt to reconcile he had a negative result following the meeting of 30 October last, where, he resolves him, the councilors cannot participate, but they had answered the day before all the questions of the unions ... between the parties that they can naturally present themselves. However, it is useful to highlight that positive ideas emerge from the report in this sense by the retirement home which has communicated that starting from the year 2025 it will be possible to allocate additional resources for staff replacements and also that two of the six vacant Oss positions will be stabilized shortly, thus recalling that the other four are covered by personnel hired indefinitely, temporarily assigned to the retirement home and that will pass to the community only once it will be opened. It will be opened, it was the first question, therefore from the spring of 2026, so there are 18 months to be able to make a whole series of choices. It is also useful to represent that, also with respect to the requests that came from the staff who were present in the healthcare facility and that should then open with the community hospital, these professional figures, therefore the OSS and the nurses have all asked for to be able to pass through Parini - are the resources that were used to reopen the neurology department, regarding the fact that we are in a difficult situation - to go all together and to be able to return all together, which would have been a formative moment for them. We can explicit, after this has happened, that both the experience is so positive that they are even officially manifesting the possibility of continuing to operate at Parini, both by Parini, towards this staff, both OSS and nursing, the response was absolutely positive. Even in this sense, therefore we do not believe we have done something strange, but we simply tried to find a solution that went to do the good of the Aosta Valley community as a whole."
47965,XVI,07/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,6,4066,"Councilor, nobody says that you have not done the good of the community. What I say is that it was quite understandable, but it was already the moment when you did that agreement scheme, so at that point, I repeat, all the staff of the J.B. had to be asked Festoz. Also allow me to say: why then the staff of the micro, even that, does not have the opportunity to make a training period in the hospital, instead of those of Introd now they have to leave Morgex and so on? We give everyone this great possibility if the idea is that and I repeat, because, in my opinion, the drawing was already clear from the beginning, that is, when it has been decided to move the RSA Variney and outsource it, to move the staff to neurology. Of course, as you said, in the agreement scheme it was written: ""ensuring the necessary training, as well as maturation of experiences in view of the subsequent use at the Community Hospital"". I believe that people don't like to go back and forth like packages, this is quite evident, so it was rather normal that this would happen. From the beginning I say: but why don't inter -medium mobility do not make? Why is this possibility not given at this point to everyone? I tell you, councilor, we will watch on this very carefully because on this we spent initiatives on initiatives and she remembers it well, so much so that she talked about Feuilleton not at all, because I have a folder of this type. From this point of view, I will get them all out, because I said every time: but why don't you make a mobility? I asked him a thousand times. If now this mobility takes place, I say to all the OSS of the territory to do the same identical thing, because at this point, if the idea is to outsource everything that is outside to bring it to the hospital, it can be a choice, then everyone is given the opportunity to everyone and not only to those who want. On the other hand, she continues to talk about money and it is right, because the money is put by the regional administration, but, when we talk about funding, then we do not look if these loans go through, how is the assistance, quality and conditions of work? It seems to me a bit like saying that those who sell underwear does not know what the neighbor does, who sells socks. This seems to me to say. Also from this point of view I, councilor, I invite you not only to say: ""We have given the money"", but if that money goes well. From this point of view, she said it too today: she said that 60 days replacements are made differently and people who are there are used. I don't think there is a scientist to understand that this brings a work of work to the staff who is there and is of the staff who already does a job that is not really a non -haurant job, so much so that we have long asked for all this. Perhaps his numbers are to be reviewed because, from what I have heard today by his colleague Manfrin, an OSS must just be fired, so most likely the numbers are still increasing. Compared to the fact that she could not go to conciliation, I wonder, if she could not go, so that she was invited. That is, if one cannot, but why was he invited? That is, in my opinion, it should not even be invited. This is my opinion ... (intervention by the commissioner Marzi out of the microphone) ... no, who does not go to conciliation certain, but why was he invited? What I want to mean is that if the trade union organizations have asked her ... and it is enough to see another interesting resolution of October 2024, that is, when it is essentially said that the Board of Directors does nothing but what is told by the councilor. So if the commissioner asks to rationalize, they rationalize. I don't know ... I will have the letter, councilor, so that we can somehow compare ourselves, but, from this point of view, most likely then you talk to those who appointed in that board of directors."

For correctness I must say that the first time that we talked about Agricampeggi was, I believe, in November 2022, following a question by the colleagues of the Lega Group, who asked what was the timing of approval of the law on multifunctionality in agriculture. During the response of the then councilor Sapinet, the agricampeggio was also mentioned, because, completing the answer, he said: ""There are still some particularly important aspects relating to the performance of some types of activities so far not foreseen in the current legislation, such as the agriculty ..."" and then continued with something else. The question was then resumed seven months later by colleague Minelli during an interpellation, which tended to know, in addition to other things, the state of the art on the reform of law no. 29, which is that law that regulates farmhouses. In the premises of the interpellation, colleague Minelli recalled an amendment he presented on the law, I must say famous law no. 8, which concerned the Covid period. He had inserted an amendment where there was talk of agritourism structures that could foresee open spaces intended for the temporary settlement of a maximum of three curtains or caravans, for a maximum of 9 people hosted, to which a toilet, a shower and a sink are reserved. He practically introduced the concept of agriculture. I also remember my position on this amendment, which was not entirely positive. Having said that, it cannot be hidden that the phenomenon of agriculty is an evolving phenomenon, which could well marry with our territorial reality if well coordinated and regulated. Since therefore in other regions it is growing dramatically, one wonders what could be done in the Aosta Valley and what is the state of the art of the standard, if we are well underway, if you want to transpose it, if you want to make one aside. Just to know what the fall point could be."

In the meantime, as you well know, of course, compared to the moment of the presentation of the interpellation, there was the postponement of the presentation of the ""Giro"", which was initially established for November 12, postponed to a date to be destined. At the moment it would seem the presentation in early January, but the date is not confirmed. Beyond the dates, which also emerge from the correspondence that I will read, are not at the moment in the condition of confirming them or the arrival of the stage, nor the subsequent departure, as there is no confirmation of this, because the official confirmation, as communicated by RCS, will only have the day of the official presentation. As far as contacts are concerned, as she correctly reported in the last part of your premises, on the occasion of the ""Next Gen"" tour, we started to interloquire with RCS Sport, even if the contacts, in reality, continued after the ... Let's say the unfortunate stage of May 2023, which saw our region jump to the foot, and then resume in Switzerland and arrive in Crans-Montana. We had a series of meetings and telephone contacts, which I then followed a letter on 11 September 2024, this also in response to the second question on what we asked RCS in relation to the non -passage of 2023: ""I follow the meetings that occurred to confirm the will of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta to host an arrival and a stage departure of the"" Cycling Giro d'Italia 2025 "". part of your organizational structures. With the present and in the spirit of great collaboration that has always been between the whole of the Valley community entirely and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"" are to ask you to evaluate the possibility of making the stage of the Grand San Bernardo in the municipality of Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses as the main option, at an altitude of 2,473 meters above sea level, already identified as Coppi Coppi in the unfortunate stage. Borgofranco/Crans-Montana of the edition of the ""Cycling Giro 2023"", whose passage, due to adverse weather conditions, had to be replaced with the provision of the passage of the runners inside the tunnel of the Grand San Bernardo, in turn then definitively canceled, with great disappointment also and above all for the great work carried out by the local communities to welcome the caravan of the Giro in the best way. The arrival of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would therefore be a right and necessary recognition certainly appreciated and prepared with great professionalism ... "", then a series of other considerations. On September 20, I was answered:"" We receive his letter from 11 September relating to the request to organize a stage arrival at the Colle del Grand San Bernardo and thank you for the interest in the pink race. The proposal is certainly very fascinating, but at the same time we must take note of the non -feasibility from the logistical point of view of a stage that ends at the top of the pass. The installations of the stages of arrival of the ""Giro d'Italia"" require large spaces for the construction of the Hospitality areas, the TV Compound, the Sponsor Village and all the service facilities. Several parking areas are also necessary for the vehicles of the team, the organization, the media and all those who follow the ""Giro d'Italia"". If on the one hand we find ourselves not being able to accommodate your request, on the other we are available to study a sporting project that can enhance your region and return the pink race to the Aosta Valley also given the historic profitable collaboration that unites us and that has led, during the current year, to the great departure of the ""Giro Next Gen"" for athletes under 23. The design of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would provide that the latest stages are held in the north-west. Peninsula then return to Rome for the final stage. In this context, a stage arrival and a departure the following day in your splendid region would be perfectly stuck. The two stages would be inserted, as mentioned previously, in the last weekend of running, to be exact on Friday 30 and Saturday 31 May, configuring, at least on paper, as a decisive stages of the pink race "", then a series of other assessments on the returns of the presence of the"" lap "". The dates should be confirmed because the problems - and I continuously use the conditional precisely because we do not have certain information - should only concern the first week of the"" tour "", Second onwards everything should be confirmed. Together with the ""Giro d'Italia"", the stage of the ""Giro"" for electric bikes will be associated, the ""Giro d'Italia"" with the Road bicycle with pedal assisted is increasingly followed. It is a ""tour"" in the ""tour"", complete with teams formed by former professionals in the staff and real captains deputies to win the final classification. To them are added the VIPs, the stage guests in the stage, to ennoble even more a start -up park of absolute value and level, not only sporty. The mileage of the individual fractions is around 50 kilometers. To this must also be added the section of stage pedaling by the cyclists invited by the Main Sponsor Mediolanum. Also in this case at the start there will be former professionals and well -known characters from the world of entertainment and business. Associated with this we think of the creation of a stage committee that can work for the enhancement of the hamlet, involving the territory and the community with, for example, among other activities, a cycle-pedalated cycle that can involve all the actors of the professions related to the world of the mountain. As for the third question, as she reported, there was a contact to have a meeting on July 16, 2023, through the mayor of Saint-Gervais, with the general manager of the tour, Christian Prudhomme. The evaluation made after appropriate checks highlighted that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to be able to speak with the management of the tour on the very hot days of the race, risking to have little attention and to at risk the goodness of the project itself, deposited in Paris in 2019, called ""Tour du Mont Blanc"", which affected Haute-Savoie, the Valais and the Aosta Valley in a triptych of stages. One of the hypotheses at the level of the stages involved the departure from Bourg-Saint-Maurice, the entry into Valle d'Aosta from the Colle del Piccolo San Bernardo and the arrival in Pila. It was thus decided to afraid in view of more appropriate situations, dedicating time and resources to first report the ""Giro d'Italia"" again on the streets of our region, also because, making parallelism with the stages organized by some regions of the North, therefore Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Piedmont, in the great departure of the ""Tour de France 2024"", which affected these regions with three stages and a departure on the fourth day. Short routes communicated amounts to around 7 million euros. Today they are therefore resources that would not be available for an activity of this kind."
47967,XVI,07/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,4096,"I carefully listened to the councilor's response about this long -awaited stop, but let's say stages that will be there in 2025, but above all so expected by the Aosta Valley after what happened in 2023. Obviously she cannot climb over the institutional passages that must be made by the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", so she gave us some information for a while to clarify what has been reported in the newspapers. We understand that precise details cannot be revealed at this moment. The thing you have well said and that it is right that it is then reported also in the media is that with precision the dates will be on 30 and 31. We said this because we learned from the newspapers on the date of October 28, in news ansa was reported - it seems to me from a press release of the regional council - that she confirmed the two stages and the dates of 29 and 30 May had been written. On the same day on ""Aosta News"", which always took inspiration from this press conference, days 30 and 31 were reported. It is therefore also right to specify these dates in such a way that it is precisely clarifying. These dates are certainly very positive because, as we all know, the ending of the ""Giro d'Italia"" ... will then be the decisive days for the general classification and therefore, at the show level, it will be a great sporting and technical show in our region. We hope that, as has been reported in the newspapers, highly technical routes are identified, because in any case our roads are such. In the second stage, assuming these locations that have been described in an unofficial way within the media, therefore with possible arrival in the Val d'Ayas and a restart in the valley floor, which could be Verrès, we hope that the restart may perhaps predict a path that does not start immediately from Verrès in the direction of the Fondovalle, to try to better enhance our region, our roads and above all all the excellence of the Aosta Valley. We are sure that the arrival of that stage, that is, of the previous day ... which will arrive inside the Aosta Valley and then go to Val d'Ayas ... you will already go on that stretch, then replicating it in the exit would be a little duplicate at the level of showcase internationally. This is a passage, then we know that it is not easy to be able to do what you want, but surely, if you lay good bases, or they give suggestions, maybe in time you can do things as one hopes. The other speech: you spoke of committees initiatives to better enhance our territory. We share this aspect a lot, they are fundamental, indeed we thank all the volunteers, the associations, the administrators who will be committed to better enhance the passage of these athletes of the caravan, because, as I said, events such as the ""Giro d'Italia"" have great visibility and therefore we must best take these opportunities. Here too she probably cannot reveal more details. We hope that in the interlocutions that have been between the Department and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", always referring to what happened in 2023, there has been the possibility of putting down a media plan that was as rich as possible as regards the enhancement of all that is our region from a historical, cultural and naturalistic point of view. We all know that, when there will be the direct, that is, the decisive stages of the ""Giro d'Italia"" that will arrive in our region, therefore with a live live that goes worldwide, if we can transmit as much as possible everything that is part of the Valle d'Aosta system, it will be a great result for everyone. We therefore hope that this work has been done and that on the other side RCS has caught these ideas, but above all ... let's repeat again ... how can it be said? He put the maximum of the commitment to give this great result, remembering what happened in 2023."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,2,2962,"Let's go back to talking in this trade in trade, small commercial activities, which are increasingly incorporated by large retailers. It has been rumored, for a long time, in Verrès, of the possible movement of the headquarters of a well -known supermarket of the lower valley, of which I will not name. This possible movement to a more strategic area has triggered a debate on between local traders, who express significant concerns regarding the impact that this reality could have on their activities, already tried by the economic crisis, by the caravan and, in particular, by the phenomenon that persists throughout the territory, both national and national and Valley: that of commercial desertification. The fear of the merchants is evident, the movement and possibly its magnification could further intercept possible customers, thus eroding the shares of the small shops already put at risk precisely, as I said before, by the phenomenon of commercial desertification. Among other things, I would like to highlight that the concentration of shopping in a single point of sale could alter the face of the historic center of Verrès and thus reduce the wealth that circulates within the community, with negative repercussions on the local economy, a concern, in our opinion, more than understandable. I repeat that we, as an opposition group, will always try to find concrete solutions to strengthen the Valle d'Aosta economic and social fabric. At this point allow me to highlight that the panorama of trade is constantly evolving: on the one hand large retailers, which, in our opinion, must absolutely be regulated and, on the other, the small neighborhood activities, two different retail models with its own strengths and weaknesses. The large retailers offers a wide choice of products, competitive prices, comfort, but at the same time presents disadvantages, such as the lack of customization, the environmental impact and less attention to quality. On the other hand, however, small neighborhood activities offer a more personalized purchase experience and, allow me, even a little more human, quality products and, above all, contribute to keeping our villages and countries alive. It is clear that these realities also present important challenges, the highest costs, the offer is more restricted and, consequently, the difficulty in competing with large retailers. Having highlighted these diversity between the two realities that cover the trade sector, we now move on to the purpose of this initiative. The undersigned appeals the councilor competent to know whether this information correspond to the truth and, if so, what strategies are intended to implement to protect the commercial activities that risk being precisely engulfed by large retailers."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,6524,"With reference to the first question relating to the news of a possible insertion of a supermarket in the former area of ​​Vuillermin Marmi, in the municipality of Verrès, specifies that in this regard there are no communications of any kind in the documents of the Department. Even the municipal administration of Verrès that we have consulted on the matter that to date in the documents of the Municipality is not filed any building practice for the construction of a new commercial building on the lot of the former Vuillermin area. The only building qualification relating to this area, deposited in 2024, concerns an intervention for the reclamation of the asbestos coverage of the existing sheds. At present there are no elements that allow to confirm or deny the news. I could also close it here, because the Municipality has correctly replied on the basis of the documents it has available at this time, but I believe it is more correct to give an answer, because the ""says"", the ""feels"" ... there are things that are ongoing, not formalized, so I have allowed myself to feel the proposer of the initiative, which represented me that at the moment the intervention concerns, as I said, the removal of asbestos -sides on three. Single body, however placed a short distance in particular by the school center and by the microcomunity for the elderly, a removal intervention that therefore I believe is to the benefit of the community. A new request for building intervention will be submitted for a total redevelopment of the area, with the editorial staff of the Pud, as required by the municipal general regulatory plan, in order to transfer the current medium of sales structure? She didn't name her, so don't I name her either? Currently located in the same municipality, a short distance away. In the new structure there would be no new product genres, therefore no restaurant, no hamburgheria, no parafarmacia, as you feel, of course, from the voices in the country, nor greater surfaces than the current ones, except for a new fishing department in the spaces necessary to guarantee a quality service for an activity not present in the municipality of Verrès, nor in the neighboring municipalities. As for the structure currently occupied by the sales structure in question? I believe that this is also part of the reorganization?, The intention of the promoter of the initiative would be to place a non -food and not present product in the area. With regard to the second question, i.e. ""which strategies are intended to implement to protect the commercial activities of neighborhood who are facing the competition of large retailers"", we reiterate that the regional administration is fully aware of the importance that the widespread presence of commercial activities on the territory is of the importance since commercial activities presides and maintain our communities alive and provide indispensable services for residents and tourists who frequent our region. It could therefore be imagined to protect the neighborhood exercises by introducing restrictions on the settlement of specific categories of productive and commercial activities, perhaps on the basis of product or dimensional criteria. This road, however - and colleague Ganis knows it very well - is not viable because no regional intervention can be separated from the respect of the principles of protection of competition, the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services. Principles that, in application of the Bolkestein directive, prevail in the generality of cases. I remember, in this regard, that in 2013 this article 1 bis had been, which we recall in all inspection activities and which therefore I do not want to resume, because it is perfectly known. In its current formulation, therefore, the regional law of trade, taking into account the territorial specificities of the Aosta Valley, establishes that free access and the exercise of commercial activities can be limited only when the goal is to protect health, workers, cultural heritage and the environment. The Department is now defining a new update and refinement of the regional law no. 12/1999 to pursue the best possible balance between the constraints of compliance with the principles of protection of competition, the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services placed by European and state legislation and the needs for the protection of the territory in a broad sense. The regional legislation also enhances small commercial realities in accordance with the principles of the landscape territorial plan, with a view to protecting mountain settlements and small nuclei. This enhancement is implemented through urban planning choices that are essentially competing with municipal administrations. In fact, even if the municipal general regulatory plan is subjected to the verification of subject to strategic environmental assessment, the government of the municipal territory is and remains the prerogative of the Municipality and, in the absence of imperative reasons of general interest, which I have listed them for a moment ago, there are no tools that allow the Region to prevent a local body from allocating an area of ​​its territory to settle a medium or large sales structure. By therefore being able to select or beat commercial activities on the basis of the size of the sales spaces or types of goods or services offered, the Region intervenes with concessions to support the commercial activities deemed important to ensure a balanced development of the territory. This is what we are doing with contributions in favor of neighborhood exercises and with subsidized rate mortgages for investment or for liquidity establishment, provided for by regional law n. 19/2001, with which the Region supports investments for the opening and renewal of commercial establishments. I close by saying that there are further support initiatives, in addition to those I have just remembered, that they are also studying in favor of commercial activities, in particular, is being predisposed ... of study rather than predisposition, at the moment a bill in support of energy efficiency and the innovation of tourism-sensitive and commercial activities, with resources already included in the 2025 budget."
47968,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,6,1485,"I thank the commissioner for the answer and for his attention to a sector, that of trade, which is a particularly in difficulty sector. Thank you again for having deepened this theme more. Personally, I did nothing but bring to the attention of this advice, that is, I did my job, the concerns of many traders and also those of neighboring countries, who do not see this possible movement. Moreover, one account is taking into account a movement, sorry; On the other hand, it is a movement with an annexation of the sales surface, which will not happen, just as she has highlighted. At this point, however, politics comes into play, because there are two roads: either to focus on large shopping centers, or better enhance our small commercial and neighborhood activities. So I close, I have already remembered it several times, because the trade law, which is particularly dated, old, should be updated. We have said it several times, for years we say it, even taking into account all these problems that we are currently experiencing, that there were no twenty years ago, therefore e-commerce, large retailers and the economic crisis. We, as a group, will continue to supervise and bring the instances of the merchants to this advice. I hope that today? And I don't know until when? Verrès traders can still be calm and sleep peacefully."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,2,3639,"Instead, I would like to draw your attention to a theme of fundamental importance, which is the question of dear life, a topic of great relevance and concern for Valley citizens. The high cost of goods and services compared to other Italian cities greatly affects the quality of life and the economic well -being of the Aosta Valley population. Allow me to bring an article back to a well -known newspaper in the classroom, of which I will not say the name: ""From an investigation by the Codacons (coordination of the associations for the defense of the environment and the rights of users and consumers), in 2024 Aosta turns out to be the Italian city where to live more, while Naples is the cheapest one. The food expenditure is convenient to do it in Catanzaro, while Bolzano boasts the most expensive food trolley. The goods and services have higher costs, for a total of € 573 Returning to our beloved region, the causes of the dear life that contribute to the increase in prices are multiple: the geographical position, being a mountain city, the costs of transport and distribution of goods are greater than the most flat areas; the seasonality linked to tourism; The local economy strongly linked to tourism, especially the winter one, therefore the high demand in certain periods of the year can increase prices; The highest cost of living, therefore salaries and pensions do not always manage to compensate for the increase in prices; We also have the problem of limited offer, therefore the presence of a small market can limit competition by promoting the maintenance of the highest prices. All this, allow me, generates a negative repercussion on the life of Valley citizens, affecting the most vulnerable bands. Many families struggle to make ends meet and are forced to give up the goods and essential services. The increase in prices erodes the purchasing power of citizens, limiting the possibility of consumption and, finally, the dear life could push more people to leave our region in search of more favorable economic conditions, therefore also in spite of policies to combat the phenomenon of depopulation of the internal areas and mountain areas. Taking into account that this issue is also very felt at national level, many bodies and institutions are involved in monitoring and managing this phenomenon. I remember that at national level Istat, the Government, the AGCM, which is the authority of the competition of the market, the Unc (the National Consumer Union) are involved, which have the task, precisely, to monitor the trend of prices and intervene in the event of anomalies or speculations. So if on the one hand these bodies and institutions can contribute to protect consumers, on the other it is necessary to implement a policy of support and support for Valle d'Aosta families in difficulty. On the basis of these considerations, our group interpelas the councilor competent to find out which instruments of monitoring of retail prices are currently in use and if the junta intends to undertake a dialogue with the most representative trade associations and the representatives of the distribution sector in order to explore solutions that can encourage greater transparency and competitiveness in prices, such as the promotion of sustainable commercial practices."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,5909,"With regard to the first question, the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy, as part of the initiatives undertaken in defense of the purchasing power of families, as she highlighted in her illustration, has activated through the action of the Guarantor for price surveillance, also known as ""Mister Prices"", a supply chain monitoring project which, to date, has the statistical information coming from the markets at the origin through the institute of services to The food agricultural market, wholesale through the Italian electronic goods bag of the Chambers of Commerce and consumption system through the National Statistics Institute. The information collected, which also concern the monthly price levels of the consumer goods and services in the Aosta Valley, can be consulted on the site of the Observatory prices and rates of the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy. Analysis and insights on the price trend are also published on the same site. On 27 June, with the signing of a protocol between the Ministry of Companies and the Made in Italy, the Ministry of the Interior and Unioncamere, in this system of detection and sharing of the information, an experimental monitoring of the consumption prices of some food and agri -food products marketed in the main retail markets, in the municipalities of the regional or autonomous provincial capital, was included. The project is aimed at experiencing a new mode of price monitoring, with particular reference to agri -food products sold in the local markets and regional capitals and autonomous province and has the aim of strengthening surveys at a territorial level and the level of analysis of consumer prices on the basis of articulated survey plans and by interaction with users. The project also provides for the activation, by the prefectures, of specific observers, which will see the participation of a plurality of stakeholders, including consumer associations registered in the list referred to in Article 137 of the Consumer Code. In particular, the protocol of June 27, 2024 provides that consumer associations, as well as in the aforementioned observers, are also involved, through the General Consumer and Market of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, to the implementing stages of the initiative in the area, contributing to the detection in the markets of the information and price data necessary to implement the protocol. To this end, the Ministry of Companies published two notices: a first notice that went deserted on September 18 and a second notice, on September 26, to collect the events of interest of the consumer associations registered in the list referred to in article 137 to participate in the price detection. The subjects thus identified load the price data collected in the area in a software made available by the Ministry itself, which forwards the data to the Guarantor for price surveillance. At the moment the activation of observers in the various provincial capitals is underway. Observers are attributed to monitor the trend of consumer prices in the identified sectors, to analyze any problems and to carry out reports to the guarantor for price surveillance. The Observatory meets at least once every two months and with the same cadence it draws up a report on the trend of consumer prices to be transmitted to the guarantor for price surveillance. The special observatory in Italy is incardinated at the Prefectures and the Regions are not part of it, even if evidently in the case of our region there is a participation in the context of the prefectural activities on the basis of the protocol signed by the Ministry of the Interior. In Valle d'Aosta, as in many regions and provinces, this special observatory was established precisely at the Prefecture and the detection activities were started with reference to two vinegar markets of Aosta. The data collected will be sent directly to the Ministry through the Chambre Valdôtaine. As for the second question, obviously we return to the point that we have already dealt with in the previous interpellation in some way. I mean that the activation also in the Aosta Valley of the price observatory will constitute a new further location in which the dialogue with the various bearers of the distribution and consumers sector will be strengthened and institutionalized, with scheduled deadlines, according to the methods just illustrated. The purpose, as mentioned, is precisely that desired in the question you asked, namely to encourage greater transparency and competitiveness of prices and in this regard, the Department has asked to be able to acquire the reports and any important documents that will also emerge for the assessments subsequent for the purposes of the changes of the rules on trade. I am not repeating the question of neighborhood exercises, because we now know it. As part of the regulatory framework currently in force, the Department grants contributions in favor of the accommodation exercises to mortgages in order to support competitiveness in the distribution sector, as well as to protect consumers and to guarantee them a widespread service in the area, as well as other study initiatives such as those that I have illustrated in the previous response. In conclusion, the Department supports the initiative in favor of consumers also through the granting of contributions to consumer associations both with regional budget funds, pursuant to regional law no. 6/2004, both by means of the participation of the Department of Ministerial calls intended annually to the same purposes."
47969,XVI,07/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,6,2064,"Thanks Councilor for the Reply. I welcome the commissioner's commitment to intervene with measures precisely aimed at reducing the cost of basic necessities. She also told me about these projects that are put in place: in Valle d'Aosta we have this special observatory, we hope they do something. What I want to tell you is that every day, unfortunately, we listen to the stories of families forced to give up - then arrival at the highlight of the initiative - to essential goods and also of young people who leave our valley. Many elderly people, after a life dedicated to work, struggle to cope with expenses, even the basic ones. So I believe that we cannot remain inert in the face of the difficulties of our fellow citizens, so it is our duty to look for all possible roads to guarantee them a dignified life. For this reason, all possible solutions must be implemented, even going to revisit the policies perhaps implemented, therefore, to face the caravan in our region, it is necessary to involve institutions, associations, businesses and citizens. Now I arrive at the highlight of my initiative. Allow me to report some solutions to her. She has said a couple, I will say others, in my opinion, important, always in view of an effective collaboration: to encourage local production, to implement the collaboration between consumer associations, give support to local businesses, but also to introduce maximum roofs to prices for some basic necessities. In all this, however, we have an important and fundamental role in contrasting the caravan through also tax policies, infrastructure investments also and support for families. We talked about it in the other advice, where there was also talk of vouchers destined for families in difficulty. So solving the problem of caravan is a complex process, it requires time, but through a joint commitment it is possible to improve and guarantee greater social equity."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,4659,"At the end of this session we will speak a little of national politics, our colleague has already done this this morning, somehow anticipating some themes of this motion a little and so I will also have the opportunity to respond in some way to the observations he made this morning. We all know that the bill was approved in the Chamber: ""Provisions on public safety, protection of staff on duty, as well as victims of usury and penitentiary system"". This bill is now in the Senate. We highlight that in the 38 articles of the ""Security"" bill 13 new cases of crime appear, more varied aggravating circumstances, including: article 10, which provides for imprisonment of up to a month for the road or railway block committed by a single and from six months to two years if the crime is committed by several people gathered; Article 15, which opens the possibility of prison also to pregnant and mothers, and infants; Article 19, relating to crimes of violence or threat and resistance to public officials, with the aggravating planned if the fact is committed to prevent the creation of a public work or a strategic infrastructure, such as, for example, the bridge over the Strait or the Turin/Lyon railway line; Article 28 with which public security agents are authorized to bring some types of firearms without license; Article 32, which provides for the closure of the exercise of activities from 5 to 30 days for shopkeepers who sell SIM cards without proceeding to identify customers and so on. With all these new rules inserted, the government has decided to want to manage numerous social issues, according to our point of view, in the most illiberal way possible, that is, repressing with the use of the criminal system of prison, instead of opening up to dialogue and listening, while intervening to alleviate the problems that grip the towns and citizens, which is what we would expect instead from a democracy. For us to balance the security measures with the protection of individual freedoms is important and for this reason we recall the principle that security policies should in no case compromise the fundamental rights of citizens, such as privacy, freedom of movement and expression. In this sense there is already a first response to what the colleague Manfrin said today, because this flyer was on the union bulletin board, according to my point of view, also rightly, because the right to show workers is also somehow affected. I highlight it because it seems to me that, from what he said, then I have not verified on the union bulletin board, but it is not that there are all the initiatives ... Obviously there are the initiatives that are most dedicated to workers in some way. I did not analyze with the attention that the colleague paid compared to the bulletin board, but a first answer, in my opinion, is there. A right, which is the right to demonstrate, at this moment is somehow limited with the ""security"" decree, so I think it is important that workers know that by manifesting this can become a crime against them. In our opinion, there is also the importance of also providing monitoring and transparency mechanisms for new measures so that their application can be controlled and that they do not somehow also be abused. Democratic control is essential to prevent the tightening of safety standards from being used also disproportionately. This is why the demanding is very simple. Meanwhile, we will understand how colleagues think, many of us participated in those events, have also authenticated signatures, therefore, from a certain point of view, they also activated compared to this issue and what we would like to bring out is what the classroom think, having surely certainties compared to those in front of me, because I already imagine what will say. The commitment, however, is to activate the regional government, to take action to the Aosta Valley parliamentarians because the excerpt of this bill is requested from the national government and to the Parliament, which for us is somehow also an attack on the democratic principles that we consider important. As I said, I already imagine what will be said by some people, but this is our thoughts and therefore we also wanted to submit to the classroom and understand also colleagues what they think. It is acknowledged that the President Bertin summarizes the presidency from 19.41."

I certainly personally, this is a bill that I do not approach. There is no doubt about this. But where do I go to lose here? On the commitment. The demanding of this motion is over, you can no longer do, it is the past. The deputy has already voted. We had to ask the Senator, who we know very well ... (intervention of a councilor outside the microphone) ... but they will be the ones who will have to tell him. Therefore on this motion ... (intervention by a councilor outside the microphone) ... there is not even suspense, dear adviser, because it is clear, has passed. This motion must be withdrawn. That is, they have already played the music, what do we do now? Are we going to make us laugh behind? Because if we present something of this kind, we make ourselves laugh behind. What do they tell us? They tell us that you have voted in the room, we are waiting for the Senate ... and the senator is clearly deployed. Therefore this is a motion that, according to my point of view and the movement that I represent, must be withdrawn."

This is a question of institutional grace, because, from a certain point of view, we have two parliamentarians. After that I imagine that the deputy also has contacts with senators, right? It is hoped at least that in some way not only you work with the senator, but also works in another way. This is hoped that it is not there alone and small.

Activating to ask for the excerpt is something that can very well do. From this point of view, then ... if you want to amend and write that we only ask the senator and you want to do this, but it would be important to understand what your position is, which cannot entrench yourself behind, honestly, to these motivations that we have heard at this moment."

Since the colleague has always been very diligent in obviously denouncing expressions of a certain gravity, we would like that it actually occurred what this expression was and for this, of course, it was acting accordingly; If, on the other hand, it wasn't and we got it wrong, well, no problem. Secondly, we highlight that for the second time the colleague turned to councilors who are part of this classroom with obviously unresolved references, as ""circus councilors"", evoking periods of the story that, clearly, are by now dormant. I therefore believe that everyone within this hall has the right to be able to be able to agree or not agree with what is said, but the dignity of all the members of the Council must be guaranteed. I would kindly ask you, president, to apply her role and to prevent it from being addressed to people who are within this classroom who think differently.

She cannot intervene by blocking people! Because otherwise everyone invents a motion and while she speaks, since I invent something, she stops me or I stop it. Here is not the case!

Just to clarify that in article 60, order motions, as Vice -President Marguerettaz rightly said, it is written that ""they make the discussion suspend"". The suspension of the discussion is specified, if she looks, in Annex 24, because ""the Commission of the Regulation, in the meeting of 23 November 2000, has established not to admit in general order motions for the verification of the legal number that interrupt the intervention during a councilor, while other order motions remain admissible by reference to the regulation also carried out during the intervention, involving in this case the momentary interruption"". This is a resolution of the 2000 Regulation Commission, which means that the ratio of the rule is that the reference to the regulation interrupts the intervention. This is the choice of the Regulation Commission and this is written black on white. I'm sorry, president, but I said something to her because obviously it is so, so more than this ...

The ""security"" decree represents an attack on individual and collective freedoms, represses dissent and aims to transform citizens into subjects. The right faces each problem with a new crime and new aggravating people without putting 1 euro to strengthen really urban security and social cohesion policies. It affects fragile subjects, such as pregnant women and children forced to prison, instead of alternative measures ... represses all forms of dissent, even if exercised with non -violence or passive resistance and has completely unjustified the industrial hemp chain or at least tries and afterwards I will explain why. From the introduction of the crime of arbitrary occupation of a property intended for the domicile of others, punished with the imprisonment from 2 to 7 years, to the transformation from administrative offense to criminal blocking of the road blocking, which earns the appellation of ""Anti Gandhi standard"" by right, since it provides that those who block roads or railways crowns in a sentence up to a month of imprisonment and 300,000 euros of fine ... if they protest more people. In an event of workers and workers of a union, and here is the link between the ""Security"" decree and the unions, the sentence rises from 6 months to 2 years in prison. There is no lack of specific sanctions for those who protest against public works defined as strategic, such as the bridge over the Strait or the Tav, currently sanctioned with slight penalties and fines. By Ilaria Salis, accused of having participated in 2008 in an illegal occupation of a property abandoned to the latest generation events, the majority led by Giorgia Meloni does not forget anyone in its repressive dedications. A package of measures is dedicated to prisons, not already looking for solutions to the problems that are highlighted and reported daily, primarily the suicide emergency, to which we unfortunately witness month after month. The direction you take is the one you least need. The postponement of the penalty for the mothers of children lower per year or for pregnant women is made optional, the crime of revolt in prison is also introduced, which includes not only violent acts, but also the passive resistance to orders, such as the hunger strike, punished from 1 to 5 years. Then comes a new aggravating circumstance to the crime of instigation to disobey the laws: if committed within a penitentiary or against detained people, the penalty can be increased up to a third. Same rules in the CPRs, the stay centers for repatriations, treated, as logical to the right, by real detention centers, with the addition of the ban on the purchase of a telephone sim to migrants without the residence permit. With Article 18, and on the government decision, Cannabis Light is equated with drugs, making it illegal to sale, import, processing, distribution and transport in all its form, destroying, or at least trying to destroy, in fact, an industrial supply chain, fortunately suspended provision, from the Lazio Tar, which has given reason to the growers of this plant. The urban daspo is widening, or the ban on access to some urban areas even for those who have only been reported or sentenced in a non -definitive way in the last 5 years for a series of crimes if these have occurred in stations or airports. The so -called ""Security Decree"", which someone has rightly renamed ""Repression Decree"", is a liberticidal law, which brandishes the criminal code against unions, students and students and all the people who want to express their dissent in a non -violent way, a decree that to the problems and social injustices of our country responds with the tightening of the penalties by despising our Constitution. These rules, in addition to not resolving the problems, aggravating the work of the police forces and to deceive the courts more, will only make the current situation worse, creating a climate of greater insecurity between the towns and citizens. This is obviously the ultimate goal of those who have lived politically for years, fueling fears and conspiracysumes."

As for the merit, we would like to make some considerations on this decree. We believe that the ""security"" decree corresponds to the needs of the country to guarantee a respectful coexistence among citizens. I have listened carefully to the positions that are legitimate, but that we do not share at all and that are far from our way of seeing the organization of society. To say that you have to work on the formation of citizens who live on the inconvenience or who have problems is a beautiful declaration of intent, between two or three generations we will see the results. In the meantime we find citizens, according to what you say, who can afford to illegally occupy a property, a private property of others and must not be punished. There are citizens who can manifest themselves in the middle of a highway, to block the country, which can block railway lines, which can block transport. In your opinion, does this mean to demonstrate? The democratic manifestations are made in another way for our way of interpreting the organization and democratic life of a country. It seems to us that, in this respect, there was the need to intervene, because we must also be respectful of the freedom of others. It is not that because I claim a right, my freedom, I can put the overall organization of society in crisis. There are ways to express one's principles, your voice and ideas, in our opinion, in a very different way from those we have heard. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we are deeply convinced that it goes a little more security in this country, conditions go so for us to guarantee the conditions for everyone to live peacefully. In our way of seeing and interpreting the institutional organization, we cannot afford to crisis the lives of others. For this reason, therefore, on the merits, we announce it, our vote is against the commitment that has been proposed."

I therefore made a reference to the facts that harm the honor of a councilor. Having been the recipients of some invitations, I believed it was important, since the person who made it responsible was the first to put the tip, the lighthouse, the finger at other people, to point out this step, but we will talk about this, so much the recordings are there, so we will have the opportunity to talk about it later, do not worry. As far as the merit of the initiative is concerned, I would like to thank the colleagues very calmly, because I believe it is actually an important theme, on which the discussion allows us to express our thoughts and allows us to express it in any case different between us and you, who have proposed it, and we appreciated, I personally appreciated also the calm tones with which you have rightly expressed your opposition. Instead, I appreciated a little less, but this is in the game of the parties ... and I understand the rather agitated intervention of those who, unfortunately, are forced to bavaglio to never be able to intervene, especially when there are themes that concern something they would like to say, so as not to be stolen even the last voter who has remained, right from the two colleagues who have proposed this initiative and instead he is always forced to silence ... in fact I saw some particularly dark colleague in the face, Speaking with this vehemence he threw out weeks and weeks of broods, of not expressed words. To come instead to the merits of the initiative, we say that even compared to what has been said, connects Guichardaz, surely, when we intervene on the merits of the events, the right to show is limited, but let's not forget that the right to express one's dissent is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is clear that I cannot do it in the way I like most, but I have to follow certain rules. Obviously, the Constitution also provides that there is an application of the rules for events. For the events, it has already been said, but I think it is important, a stop has been put in some ways that objectively they had shown themselves particularly wrong to manifest their thoughts. I think there is no problem, and there has never been, in organizing initiatives, public meetings, fashion shows, processions. We also saw it here in the Aosta Valley, different facts have been made and, when they are peaceful, they do not create any problems. It is different when these then intervene and maybe suspend a public service or create an obstacle. We have all seen, for example, the famous initiatives that have become quite famous all over the world ... In a part of the world, in the western world, what allows you to do it because in others they do not allow themselves. I don't know, those who manifest for the climate, I don't know if they are all called ""fridays for future"" or have different acronyms. The blocking of the traffic that is made evidently has big problems: if I block the traffic, I do not block only the person who is going to the cinema, block the person who is going to work and maybe risks dismissal, block the ambulance with a person on board who risks dying, blocks a series of connections that certainly do not favor the call of attention, indeed they are even counterproductive for two reasons: first, surely the people who remain in the traffic are not happy in the traffic. And they certainly don't get passionate about the theme; Secondly, the machines stopped in traffic certainly produce much more CO2 while remaining stopped there, surely those are not the modalities. I have heard of a crime of revolt and ""anti Gandhi standard"", which, however, was actually used wrongly because this case of crime has been introduced for the prison interiors and this rule provides that ""anyone within the prison participates in a revolt through acts of violence or threats or resistance to the execution of the orders given by three or more people gathered is punished with the imprisonment from 1 to 5 years. The acts of resistance are also the conduct of passive resistance: we imagine, for example, the walking and prisoners who refuse to return to the cell as protest when you have to return. We have seen the acts clearly protest of that type. The prisoners clearly have all the rights, they have lawyers who go to prison them, they can manifest what they want, there are methods in those structures that, however, are not good and these modalities, this same case is expected for the centers of detention and welcome of migrants. It is therefore not for all events, but for some types. Then we talked about the prisoners with children. A problem was addressed that unfortunately it was a serious problem, because there was a repeat of mothers' crime, which actually hid behind their children so as not to end up behind the bars and who used this as an excuse to continue baggage. Perhaps in our reality we realize less, but in the realities that have subway or trains, unfortunately, this is a reality that is very present and has become a plague. I think that anyone who sees the news can notice it. Clearly here we do not talk about taking and banging people behind bars, but, since the sentence provides a postponement here, in that case the execution of the sentence will not be postponed, not always, but ""if the judge will recognize the risk that further crimes can be committed and will be able to take place in an institution with attenuated custody for prisoners"". The penalties are also tightened for those who use minors for begging and the maximum penalty goes from 3 to 5 years. Again: Cannabis has been talked about. This government has said it from the beginning: we are evidently against the use of drugs, whether they are light or heavy, we do not rightly do this type of distinction. I honestly have to say only one thing: it makes me a lot of pain who, to endure their day, find his personal relaxation or outburst in ""spipating"" a little drug. I feel a lot of pain for him and, sincerely, I think there are different ways, different ways of being able to live one's life and to also be able to find a moment of leisure and relaxation. What has been said about the sentences is actually true, but the government, of course, from this point of view, will continue to move forward. Again: we talked about events and sit-in. There will be a block, as we said, not only on the part of the roads but also on the tracks, because unfortunately a person is sufficient on a track to completely block a train and a connection. We realize what evidently can happen. What has been said ... the aggravating circumstance of dissent on works of great importance unfortunately has made itself necessary because, for great works that are essential for our country, like the Tav, unfortunately it has come to the urban war to be able to defend a work that is truly indispensable and to connect the corridor 5, which unfortunately is a necessity. Moreover, for example, the Democratic Party has never denied this position and the need to build this work when it was in the government. I believe this was a need for everyone, not just a political part. Again: the penalties for damage in the demonstrations have been tightened. Indeed, manifesting in a peaceful way is not only allowed, but is desired. It is right to manifest and I much prefer those who manifest, those who expose themselves, show that they do not agree in an absolutely peaceful way compared to those who maybe get away and go to break the windows, break the cars and maybe breaks it to a poor man who has to wake up and go to work, who has nothing to do with it, but, ""since I have to manifest, I have a split"". We remember the interview with that boy who said: ""Well, if you don't split things to the events ... that is brothel!"". Unfortunately, those people must be punished and deserve to be punished, it is clearly evident. Again: there is an extension of the urban daspo. We also consider this a useful measure to be able to bring some order back to those cities that are certainly today, unfortunately, also prey to a petty crime, which is called micro, but that in reality the people who live those realities feel important on their own skin. In the manifesto, in the flyer that was then put on the union bulletin board, it was said that we take it with migrants. She also said, connects Guichardaz, in her speech. Why? Because simply a common sense rule is inserted, that is, it is not that you take it with someone, simply the case is created for which, in the event that the companies should sell SIM cards without observing the identification obligations for customers, the sanction of the closing of the exercise or activity for a period from 5 to 30 days is applied. It is clear that you cannot sell sims to people who do not even have a regular residence permit, people of this type in theory are irregular immigrants and in this country they should not be there. Eventually, we know, you know it better than us and you also know very well the associations that defend them, they have every right to go and ask for the right of asylum, they can do it and, if the right of asylum is denied, they evidently have no title to stay here. If they have no title to stay here, why should they be able to have a SIM? To stay here illegally, perhaps to perform crimes? Because in theory, if they are not legally, they cannot work, they cannot have a contract. How do they earn to live? I think these are the reliefs that everyone should be placed, but of common sense. I don't think there are safe things, as has been said. Crime of arbitrary occupation. This is not talking about this, but it is important. The part of illegal occupation of housing has truly become an important situation and we are also suffering some cases. Councilor Marzi knows ... I know, I imagine, also the commissioner Sapinet by virtue of their occupation with respect to the residential construction part, there are people who unfortunately have abusively occupied housing, even public housing, and unfortunately to send them away ... not those who cannot pay because they don't make it, but those who occupy these houses because they do not have the opportunity to find another, but they are clearly abused ... cleared. In fact, the crime is introduced because ""anyone who occupies and holds a property for a property intended for the home of others or prevent access to the legitimate owner is punished with a penalty from 2 to 7 years. The rule? This is a nice novelty? It is also valid for the appurtenances such as car garage, courtyards, balconies, terraces. Same fate for anyone who intrudes or cooperate in the occupation of the property, or it will receive money, utility for the employment itself "". The plague therefore that there is in other areas to occupy the popular houses by interposed person by renting them. Again: an aggravating circumstance for crimes in the stations and in the meter, we said before, that we do not hear but that are absolutely present. Then a whole part on the modification of the anti -mafia code to make it more effective. Trivially, the interruption of the benefits to relatives of the mafia ... if they interrupt relationships with the relative who, in fact, has been arrested, or is a subject recipient of prevention measures or subjected to a relative criminal proceeding. Again - this is a rule on which we have really focused a lot -: the revocation of citizenship if there is a condemnation for terrorism or serious crimes. ""It extends from 3 to 10 years and from the final sentence to the final sentence to be able to adopt the revocation of citizenship for crimes of terrorism and subversion and other serious crimes. We cannot proceed with the revocation of citizenship if the interested party does not have or cannot acquire another"". Finally, the crime of detention of material with terrorist purposes is still: ""Anyone will be punished with imprisonment from 2 to 6 years, outside the cases of association with terrorism and training purposes to activities with terrorism purposes, consciously procure or holds instructions for the fulfillment of terrorism acts, dissemination and education on the preparation and use of explosive or toxic substances for the purpose of completing the crimes against the personalities of the state "". We believe that these are common sense choices. On this and on security, the League evidently carried out very strong choices, choices that were in government programs, choices that we have claimed and choices that are absolutely compatible, obviously they will be once approved in the Senate. Before, at the beat level, I told Marco's colleague who intervened that it was not known if the colleague Spelgatti would then vote for the measure in the Senate. I have not consulted with her, of course, for this initiative, but I can with discreet confidence not to be denied, that obviously Senator Spelgatti will instead vote for this provision. It will vote and apply it as it is right that it is, because evidently, as we have undergone, unfortunately, in years of governments that tended to see little alternation, they saw a prevalence of the Democratic Party, which was able to go to govern even when it lost the elections, for once we have an elected government that on a program obviously collected consent and on this, evidently, it will carry on what she promised to do. In good title, regardless of the feasibility or non -feasibility of the motion, I would like to thank the colleagues for introducing it and allowed us to express ourselves and obviously announcement that, if the motion is not withdrawn, the Lega group will vote contrary."

It is quite evident that in any case I do not recognize myself, we do not recognize ourselves in the least in those who, in the name of Moloch, must express at all costs and with all means, prevents the performance of the normal activity of a company. We don't recognize ourselves. They are visions, we respect the different position, but we do not recognize ourselves in the least, just as we do not agree on the disarm the police. On my own, on our own, the police are called law enforcement agencies because they exercise and have strength in the name of the order, or they are law enforcement and it is allowed that they do exactly what the name expresses, the expression, otherwise there is a small short philological or even simply logical circuit. It is clear that all this is not only for a question of fans, because we know, among other things, that we unfortunately live in a country where the problems are not even the offenders or those who delinque, or those who transgress the rules or those with their behaviors makes social life difficult. The problem is those who cheer for these, and there is, there are political areas that do it, but I don't want to open this speech. We are on the other side. We are with the police, we are with an order, we are with the rules, on the side of the rules and all this we do not for partisans, not for fans, but simply because we put people's safety first in a society, in a community. The safety of being able to do your job, to go to work and not find a block while someone goes to open their business. We are for the safety of those who start by train and know that at a certain time this train will arrive at your destination. We are for this security. However, the important thing is that truly, in a perhaps irritated way, and to which you are not used to, colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli, I want to make you sincere compliments, because you have highlighted a vulnus, which appeared very evident in this discussion, of the majority. There was an absolutely shareable intervention by Marco's colleague. I can tell him as a military military person on leave, very strategic, impeccable. He did not make a turn. I congratulate her too, Collega Di Marco, found the perfectly logical logical way, to get out of the impasse of having to take a position of choice regarding this motion, which would have put the majority a little in difficulty, which evidently consists of heterogeneous political forces, a left component and an autonomist component, assuming that the autonomist component is not left. However, the fact is that the speech of Marco's colleague had his beautiful location, a logic, a logical thread, a conductor line and then there was the intervention of his colleague Padovani, on whose content I do not recognize myself, but also to her, colleague Padovani, I congratulate, because telling the truth is a sign of consistency. She consistently wanted to express her political position, trying to climb over the left, on the end left, the protagonists of this initiative and of this motion, the subscribers of this motion. In his positioning in the far left he has shown that the majority really has enormous eterogeneity, but above all this heterogeneity is not only the fact of saying: well, we go to recognize the egg of Columbus. What do you have to do the left with the autonomists? Which is what we are not only wondering, but since 2020 he has been asking for the Aosta Valley. It reveals the fact that all this debate and this different positioning emerged after about twenty minutes of interruption, of a majority meeting for evidently, I think, I presume, I decide what positions to take during the discussion of the motions. What was it that went wrong then? You have decided that there will be a part, represented by Di Marco, who represents a part of the majority and then the other part represented by Padovani, who strongly takes a political positioning that climbs to the left the subscribers of the motion. This is what it is curious, this is what it is important, that's what emerges, because it is so clear that I could be here to speak until tomorrow but I do not convince the opposite part, I do not convince the colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli to change his position, I do not convince her, colleague Padovani, to change ideological position, but I wonder: she is part of an area of ​​a party that is also represented by her two neighbors, by the commissioner Guichardaz. So is you representing the party? Are you representing itself? I would like to understand the others of the majority what they think. What is the position of the majority? Is it the position of Di Marco or the other position? This is an important element and this is the reason why I congratulate colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli. You have made this absolutely contradictory situation emerge and this is the majority that is governing the Valle d'Aosta region."

The colleague Guichardaz has already said, of course, if we present this motion, it is because we are absolutely convinced of its validity and the fact that the ""security"" decree, the bill that has been approved in the Chamber and that must be discussed in the Senate is dangerous and is absolutely contrary to a series of issues that we consider important. I do only one example, which is the one linked ... there would be many, but I only do this, which is linked to the question of the ban on selling sims to irregular migrants. I borrow the declaration that was made by Oliviero Forti, who is the immigration manager of the National Caritas, who said that this is a highly discriminatory measure, especially for a matter: because only people who are somehow totally irregular are not affected, but who incur this ban and therefore will be deprived of this possibility ... (intervention of a councilor, outside the microphone) please! ... will also be deprived of this possibility also all those who are waiting for a residence permit, who have all the requirements, have finished the process and are only waiting to have that piece of paper that allows them to be able to look for a job and be here. I also report the position of the Church, because this was on ""Avvenire"", which I believe has not yet become an extremist newspaper. I don't really think. There are also perplexities from a whole series of magistrates, prisons directors, who are worried about the effects that this type of bill will have. Step to the second part briefly. It has been said by Marco's colleague that this motion is overcome, which does not make sense because in any case the bill has already been voted in the Chamber. Now, the bill has been devoted to the Chamber, to become definitive it must also be voted in the Senate, but nothing prevents some parts of that bill from being modified. If a bill is approved by one of the two chambers and the other branch of Parliament, it makes even minimal changes, that is, it does not vote for the text that has come approved by the first chamber, this must return. The Senate could make changes, if it will make even small changes, the text will return to the Chamber and the Chamber will vote no longer on the whole bill, but only on the modified part. From a formal point of view, therefore, there is nothing that prevents this from going on. Go see you, that's the case. If not, we would have abolished bicameralism in Italy, but at the moment it is still so. Then in the whole another series of issues that colleague Manfrin faced, with much more calm tones than usual, but because there had already been the previous outburst, we would have to reply point on point. We don't have time, it's late, we're tired. Certainly the motion will not be withdrawn and the vote, as I think has also said someone else, will then have to, as on many other occasions, be the litmus test of what people actually say, think and act, because otherwise they are words, words, words."

The regulation says: ""Calls to the regulation or for the agenda or for the priority of voting"". Finished. What she invoked was a personal question or, mostly, she had to ask for the juris of honor, the honorability. He had no title to stop Padovani. That said, therefore, also the recall of the assessments to the regulation ... They are particular, but she has made no reference to the regulation, nor the order of voting, nor anything else. On the motion I believe that in the end there is a specific activity simply to plant flags, exactly like the ""security"" decree. Because the ""Security"" decree, you see, introduce and leverage the problems that are real. How to disconnect the fact that there are real problems of public order? The problem is to understand whether the ""security"" decree solves them, because this is this we must talk about. Marco's colleague said: ""We are against, but because we believe that this tool is a propaganda tool. I explain to me. If one thing is prohibited, because already a whole series of facts are prohibited, it is not increasing the penalties that we solve the issues. Because here we do beautifully advertising, electoral propaganda. A whole series of crimes that you have already indicated are not allowed and then if they are not allowed, Logic to say: ""We increase the penalties"" you think of solving the problem? The motorway? No. From this point of view, that's why we say that this is an instrument that is absolutely propaganda and, if the colleagues had had some intellectual honesty, they should have recalled the opposite vote of our deputy, who voted against already in September. From this point of view, we already cleared the field on the fact that this majority, made up of people who roughly represent a bit of all the movements that supported the candidacy of our deputy ... to understand what the orientation was, but not because we do not know the problem! We know the problem, but, from this point of view, the tool is an incorrect and propaganda tool, as exactly propaganda, you will allow me, this motion, because it is simply to be able to make a reckoning inside the left area. We believe that the demanding is an unwitting commitment, because if someone had written: ""committed to soliciting the parliamentarians to vote against"", could it also make sense, but what the hell of democracy do you have in mind? The excerpt. The excerpt of what? That is, a bill that is under discussion in Parliament ... (intervention by Councilor Minelli, out of the microphone) ... No, but you have not written what you want the excerpt. You talked in general of the excerpt ... have you also taken the way of doing manfrin? (intervention by Councilor Minelli, out of the microphone) ... so you make me a personal question ... no, because you took on the fact that you insisted, I think colleague Minelli has considered that that is an example to follow, therefore to speak above the colleagues. The excerpt of what? In the commitment, the excerration tout court, of the whole decree law, is written. Look, it doesn't work like this. If it's a rag, say what you want to excerpt; If it is to vote against, say that you have to vote against; If it is voting against, we have already satisfied you, we have already done it. For something that is already done, for us this motion, as it is set, is unreachable. For dignity we will not vote against, we refrain, because you have presented an improper thing from a technical point of view."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,48,5552,"Much, very briefly, first of all I understand and understand perfectly, connects Margurettaz, which happens a few times, because I have to recognize them a particular ability, she has attended this classroom for several years and knows the functioning of this classroom in depth. A couple of times, however, he must admit that he has been caught on the counterattack and this is one of those times. As I said, I therefore also understand the reasoning that he did subsequently, because he will never admit it, of course, but, if there had not been this diatribe, both regulatory and other, I am sure that she would not have intervened, nor would it have expressed an opinion. Obviously he would have left, as hundreds of other times did, that some of his majority colleagues on the merits were probably expressed. She does not usually take a position and would not have expressed the positions she expressed, because obviously today she has a bit the tension of the post game on and is and I understand it, so we know well what happens. However, what she probably did not understand is what is the content, but I say it absolutely without animosity and without wanting to trigger a debate, also because we will certainly have to discuss again in the next few days. Article 60 of our regulation establishes that ""the calls to the regulation, or for the agenda, or for the priority of voting? Are three different cases, therefore or call to the regulation, or for the agenda or for priority? Interrupt the discussion"". We agree on this, we established that they interrupt the discussion and interrupt the intervention: that's why I obviously said ... obviously what happens? That, if I ask with an order motion to intervene, then interrupt the discussion, at that point I receive the word from the president who asks me to explain the order motion. Which, however, was not done, because, when I asked for the floor to intervene, the colleague was not blocked and I was not given the opportunity to explain the order motion. So I felt insisted, because my right was to make a reference to the regulation. The reference to the regulation, which I then did, was precisely for article 58, therefore facts that harm the honor of a councilor. It is therefore clear that the failure to suspend the discussion and the non -word to the undersigned evidently made me intervene in a way vehemently, also because, as it will remember at the beginning of this three days of advice, I had received a deck from the president, who had cared for me to be ... as we could say ... he told me that I was a little too shy. Since I have a series of infinite defects, but shy I am not, I considered it appropriate to restore the things and the truth of the issues a little, therefore I evidently decided to defend a right. It is therefore clear that the call I made had to stop the discussion, the discussion was interrupted only later, but I believe that what happened is in the documents and we will be able to discuss it later. On the merits, I believe that technically the colleague Sammaritani can best express the position of the League, which will obviously vote in the opposite way, but I also think that it is not because, I connect Minelli, I have vented before I am kept in a calm way: it is because it is precisely the anger escaped from some of your close colleague who persuaded me that perhaps the best weapon is this. The best weapon is precisely to highlight that exactly, as colleague Distort said, there are positions that are diametrically opposed within the majority and I thank you for your action, which makes them emerge in all their violence and in all their virulence, because I know that every initiative that is made, regardless of the justifications that are given, because obviously there is no one who intervenes with this violence and with this The one in which he believes ... what you wrote ... the person who is on your right, but would like to be on your left, because he would like to represent an even more extreme wing than you represent ... he would like to vote with every fiber of his body and, if he did not have these obligations of the majority, because obviously the things that told him to hold him on that place are two: one you do the commission president and, if you do not do the commission president and are not the fascists. Because this told him, this is what happened and this is what holds him down. I have a great passion for his resistance and stoicity, but above all a great respect for the great work that another colleague does, which has become a multiple vice president of different commissions, which must manage different commissions compared to his, and above all that he must try to contain and find a square when he speaks of topics that he obviously does not resist in voting or in expanding. With a good pulled of ears, here it reaches us ... either with a good pull of ears or with a good concertation it always manages to bring home the result. The result that is winning for him and for someone else not, but, fortunately, the accounts will be done in the end. I really thank you for bringing this motion and I hope, I really hope, that you will bring others."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,50,6056,"I will try to intervene briefly, even for everyone's pity, and certainly without presumption to put an end to this discussion, interesting because, apart from the regulatory aspects, it involved issues that are both technical and clearly political. Evidently they are two different visions of how to manage a state and public safety in particular. Well, I have to say, I do it because I claim a certain intellectual honesty, which I am always adverse ... I never liked the urgent decreation and not even the laws made on the wave of emotion, therefore, when the penalties are tightened following a road accident, etc., I never liked, because I consider it anyway a run behind the events, which certainly does not be good for justice and even the management of the security and justice itself. Having made this premise, I must say that what has been said, for example, of the colleague Margurettaz, who is always sagacious in these interventions, is not entirely correct. In the sense that there are many other examples of cases in which there are crimes that already exist, conduct that are already clearly illegitimate and sanctioned by the penal code, but then they are more detailed because in a certain historical moment there are particular conditions, so there is a certain particular sensitivity towards certain conduct. I make an example for everyone: the 612-bis of the penal code, which precisely because it is called bis it means that it has been put later, in fact you all know it, red code, stalking, harassment. These crimes already existed, these conduct were already crimes, but certain aspects have been detailed because they wanted to protect women in particular, or in any case the people who are the subject of particularly serious conduct towards the life of relationship, social life. The same consideration applies to this ""security"" decree, it is evident. There have been rules that arise from a government that has taken a particular commitment regarding security and which is also a reaction evidently and giving satisfaction, in quotes, I say in a good sense, to those who voted for it, evidently, because perhaps those who ruled before had not done so. If you let certain things go, let a sense of insecurity pervades society, probably then you have to put some brakes. It may also be that you do too much, but for that you do not worry, on that other part there is the Constitutional Court, there are the magistrates, they do it, they will evaluate them. Many lawyers also contested this decree, then I am not looking at the political orientation, etc., because it is quite transversal, I must say, probably for the reasons I expressed before, order of the doctors, etc. Very well, there is no problem, the problems are solved in the courtrooms, the judges will be the constitutional court that will say: ""Here you have exaggerated, this is even unconstitutional"". Very well, we will take note, point and that's it, but this is the theme. The problem is that clearly this legislative provision, which is in progress, was of course the opportunity and what better opportunity for the left to shout to fascism, to repression, etc., etc., but this is in the game of the parties, we would miss it. The paradox, one of the paradoxes, because there is more than one, rather it is that precisely these things come from those who have never dealt with security, or they have occupied too little, and has regenerated that insecurity in the society which then asks for these answers. Collega Padovani, we do not need to go to the United States to be protected, we already do it here because, thank God, there is a government that we now consider ourselves protect us, first instead not. This is the fundamental theme. The other paradox is that precisely these criticisms towards this system to resolve things, that is, to exacerbate certain penalties and predict certain particular cases comes from who then, in reality, does the same things, but in a much more subtle way, because perhaps it does not have the courage to say: ""Look, I do a rule in which I prevent you from speaking or, better, if you talk about certain things, you are a scrangable being"". It does so in a much more subtle way because it implements a certain marginalization, a contempt for those who express different opinions. It also becomes quite paradoxical moreover the fact that one could think of going to dialogue with the No Tav with dialogue and listening, because I really know that we have the wrong approach. We have already seen it widely. On certain types of crimes I can even agree, on certain types of aggravating or rules I can even agree on the fact that perhaps they could also be excessive, but, as I say, it is not up to us to evaluate it. On other things, such as employment ... I make an example for everyone and then I close, the arbitrary occupation had already expressed the deficiency legislation. It must be remembered that within this article there is also talk of the emergency procedure for the release of the property. Here you really have to put the mutual interests on the scale, that is, it is more to protect those who occupy the accommodation or the owner who, poor, finds the accommodation occupied and does not know how to do it? This also happens here, as colleague Manfrin has already mentioned, it has already happened here that someone, even with public functions, in any case of protecting the public heritage, went to the Prosecutor to say: ""They occupied the housing, what do we do?"". And the prosecutor had to answer: ""I don't know what to do so much, we hope it goes away"". Do you understand? This is impotence. There it takes a regulatory intervention. To summarize, in fact, let's say that this type of measures are needed: they are needed because people want more security and therefore, if there have been some exaggeration, in fact, the organs deputted to clarify will think. We will clearly vote against this type of motion."

You are so off the road that, for once, the deputy that we elected two years ago two months ago has positioned each other and represented us unanimously. Colleagues, you are really out of the way.

Read what is written and retrace the stages that we have represented on some contents here. We have no problem to say that what we have written and what we think of that ""security"" decree is what we thought about the topics on which it goes to intervene from the first day we entered inside. There is no problem, from our point of view, no intention to put in difficulty who knows who. Everyone has his own conscience, everyone responds to the one in which he believes, does not believe, of the calculations he can do or not to do, of the fact of remaining consistent with his principles, his values, or not. Point. This is. Then there is the excerpt or having used another expression, patience, does not change the substance. We know very well that the bill can be completely changed from one chamber to another, or in part, there have already been the previous ones, that is not the problem, but if one believes that that measure is a measure that goes against the one in which he believes or what he is fighting, then votes, point.

The ""Security"" decree is for me a liberticidal decree, which brandishes the penal code and threatens penis in order to cancel any expression of dissent. This is honestly is something that, as a citizen, worries me both for today and for the future, but there is a ""but"", as they say, and I would like to get to the commitment of the motion under discussion.

As for the premature disappearance of Gioachino, I believe that it is worth remembering a man who left an extraordinary memory in our community. In some ways, Gioachino is the son of a particular culture, you see, the mother, is a Bertholier, who is an expression of culture, of the Valley tradition of Courmayeur, and on the other side Tony Gobbi, a person who was not Aosta Valley, but who chose the Aosta Valley like his land. You see, this situation has allowed Gioachino to grow with values, with a curiosity, with incredible intelligence and this has allowed him to take a path that is enriching for him and for the whole community. He managed to relaunch the Grivel as a leading company of a particular sector that is typical of our culture, that is, the mountaineering equipment. A successful entrepreneur, but not only, he considered himself a compulsive collector and, if any of you have had the good fortune to stay at his house, to attend him ... he actually had the opportunity to collect and collect everything, a symptom of great curiosity. Obviously accompanied by his loved ones, in particular his wife Betta, his children, Caterina and Oliviero, a person who also put himself at the service of the community because he was president of the Courmayeur Mont-Blanc Costivie for years and has always tried to create the conditions to create convergences, to create shares, therefore an activity that we have particularly appreciated. Finally, I remember only a detail of his generosity: when today we go to Skyway and arrive at the Pavillon and find this great work, if we look at the right, there is the old station. That station was of his family, of him, who gave him to our community. I believe that the Region, our community must truly evaluate and appreciate this path. Unfortunately today there will be funeral. We, as a group of the Union Valdôtaine, squeezes us around his family, I repeat, to his beloved Betta, who so nicely called him the bear, and his sons Caterina and Oliviero. Rest in peace."

He was a visionary because he believed in innovation, he believed in the re -proposed tradition, he was a great collector and I will always remember the two and a half hours passed in the summer of 2020, when he presented me a large part of his collection with a great wealth of details and was lost almost as a real enthusiast, more than a technician, of what he had collected in telling also the anecdotes, with whom he had been composing himself. However, I also want to remember him personally with his peculiarity, he was a visionary, he was a popularizer, he said, he knew how to tell, but in the judgments he knew how to be extremely seraphic, clear and decisive and perhaps the Bertholier's blood came out more than others. I remember him precisely almost any presentation of any type of initiative, Jardin de l'Ange, where he had a seraphic judgment for everyone, for the undersigned primarily and I have always thanked him with his very, very direct judgments. Courmayeur today loses and greetings to one of his children, like many others. From Creuméyeurèns I don't know if we will be able to or live like Creuméyeurèns, especially the youngest part, to replace or in any case to be able to carry on the inheritance that characters like Gioachino have left to our country. We will try to do it at best, without forgetting the contribution that these people have given and what they represented for Courmayeur-Mont-Blanc but above all also for the whole Aosta Valley. The RV group gives his condolences to the family and I personally greet his wife who was really one with Gioachino, ""one without the other - they often said - we are nothing"". It will certainly not be alone, because the family is there and so we want to remember Gioachino Gobbi."

I met Gioachino almost 20 years ago, presented by the then President Caveri, when Rossignol, the company that built sticks for skiing, was closing with forty families who risked being from the day in the aftermath in the middle of the road. The Gobbi family, with great courage, noted this activity by also doing this also a successful activity, creating the ABC Company, an activity that still goes on, keeping all the jobs and then bringing the production of the Grivel to Verrayes. From this point of view, the foresight and the great vision on the future that Gioachino has primarily put on the Grivel and then on his other business is completely evident. Allow me to remember him for this debt of gratitude that I believe the community of the whole average valley must and his family for what has been done. I also want to remember it - I had the opportunity to get to know him over the years - for his human side, a human side of great sensitivity, of great empathy, which he was able to put in his work, making his company a family; All the workers of his business really had this feeling of being within a family that had the honor in some way to bring this all -to -Aosta Valley symbol on the highest peaks around the world.

ALors, comme the a bien dit le président, the titre de la assemblée était: ""The Guerre Hybride, a Danger pour the sécurité et la démocratie"".  La Guerre Hybride Est Une forms de Conflit Quêle des Tactiques Militaires Traditionnelles à des Stratégies non conventionnes, telles que la désinformation, the cyberattaque, the soutes au mouvement insurrectionnel ou, encore, the utilization of acteurs non étatiques. Son Objectif Principal est de déstabiliser ou Affaiblir Una adversaire, tout en Évitant Une Comparetation Militaire, pas seulement militaire, direct et en restant en dessous du seuil d'une warframes. Ce type de wars est souvent utilisé par les États ou des groupes puissants pour antiintre des objectifs polytiques, é economicques ou géostratégiques, tout en maintenant una certine ambiguïté sur the origin des attack. Les Travaux Se Sont déroulés sur trois panels: the premier c'était: ""Manipulation de l'amo information, cyberattaque, ingérence étrangère et instructalisation de l'histoire, those action mise en place est envisagée, comment if défendre sans se déformer; le deuxième panel c'était: ""Les Impacts de la Guerre Hybride et de la Guerre Menée par la Russie en Ukraine sur la Politique, dutch la Politique de défense, sur les droits et sur les valeurs démocrataques""; Delegation composed of the undersigned, by the colleague secretary Corrado Jordan and the colleague councilor Marquis, with the presence of the secretary general of the Council, Dr. Perrin, followed carefully. who live the war daily, here the emotions are different. There was Volodymyr, this Ukrainian philosopher, who says every morning: ""I have three children and I don't know if these three children can take them to school, because, when the siren plays, unfortunately I cannot bring them and, when I take them, when the siren plays, instead of staying at school, these guys are in the basement"". When you listen to the Prime Minister of Kosovo, who was two and a half years in prison, tortured, to fight and have freedom, you understand that emotions change; The values ​​that we sometimes express of freedom, of democracy take on a non -trivial intensity. Then we are experiencing very heavy situations, we are experiencing them in the east, in Ukraine, are experiencing them in the Middle East and these large groups equip themselves to do truly terrible activities; When it comes to cyberattaque, they are situations where reality confuses with fantasy, but all this only leads to tragedies. So if there is a function that the parliamentary assembly of the Francophonia must have, it is trying to put on the net and to create the conditions for the values ​​of democracy, freedom are not only words, but become effective behaviors. The delegation made a contribution, it was a very positive experience and we will try to profit from what we have heard and learned in these three days of work."

We made this letter to you because, during the IV council commission, a colleague, formulating a question was stopped by the president. At the request for an explanation, the President of the Commission was justified by saying that he had been impartial and that it was a technical commission and not a political commission. We would like that she could direct the presidents of the commissions, perhaps through the application of article 9 of the regulation, thus convening a group leader and clarifying that, when the commission is convened and a politician is convened - in this case he was a mayor who had made use of the right to be accompanied by a technician that he himself will have authorized -, keeps it a political function, because this is our role and not to listen to, do not even wait for the completion of the question ... So, not being able to understand what the orientation of the question was, it is an evaluation that we consider somewhat hasty, which then led to the consequence of having to stop the intervention of Marco's colleague. We would therefore appreciate that these situations no longer repeated. If any of us came out of the sowing, it is right to stop it, but not allowing even to formulate a question it seems truly exaggerated, we are passing the limit. We turn to her as always to fully perform her functions of the management of the offices and commissions, so we expect an answer in this sense."

We had already sent a letter on October 15, we waited, in the last advice she briefly mentioned the fact that we were talking about it in the premium office and after more than a month, after 37 days, to date we have not received any response. Now a little while ago she said that there will be an answer shortly, there will be I don't know if an opinion or what. I am I would say quite bewildered, because we know that there are times to answer, we had not even received answers until that moment, not even a nod to the first letter, but then I wonder how it is possible that it does not arrive in such a broad period of time such a large opinion, also because I understand that the legal system of this country provides that there is a correct interpretation of the legislator and, in the case of that law, Also that an interpretation on his part and his offices must absolutely be, because it is not a matter of poor relevance, far from it. We are talking about a question that affects the whole community, as well as people directly involved. The failure or delayed delivery of this opinion is not admissible. We are often told that people, citizens must know the law, which is not admitted ignorance and here on a law that has been in place, that has been existed for some time, since 2007, an interpretation has not been given, it is not possible to understand how it works. I believe that it is truly too much waiting and it also seems to me that the opinion should already be there, I believe that there is already there too. The fact that it is not delivered, or in any case that it takes all this time to give an answer to the councilors, in my opinion, president, is also configured as an omission of office acts, or at least it seems to have the air. I therefore solicit that this opinion is there as soon as possible, because it seems to me that it is really strange that after 37 days, on a regional law existing for almost 20-17 years, it is not possible to give an interpretation."

We consider it necessary to share with the whole Council some considerations regarding the inaccuracies expressed in reply by the colleague and then taken up by the press, in order to mean, within this classroom and public opinion, the correct work and the absolute compliance with the legislation placed at the basis of the choices taken by Finaosta in the approach of the managerial structure. This with a view to maximum transparency and sharing, with the aim of not feeding sterile controversy based on incorrect conditions. The company, as regards the organizational measures regarding the identification of the top management approved in September of the current year, confirms that the same have been adopted in full compliance with the current, national and regional and internal regulatory legislation, as well as in compliance with the applicable implementation provisions. In particular, the company has shown that, as clarified by the most recent jurisprudence of legitimacy, with regard to public participation companies, a technical distinction must be operated between the recruitment of staff from the outside, for which the legislative decree 175/2016, the so -called ""Madia Law"", requires, as known, the completion of selections in compliance with certain public criteria and instead of career advancements. As regards career advancements, the Court of Cassation has recently stated, in fact, the principle according to which it should be excluded that the discipline of recruitment, dictated by first by article 18 of Legislative Decree no. 112/2008 and then from article 19 of Legislative Decree 175/2016, can be interpreted in the sense of also included career progressions. So much has been implemented both in the resolution of the regional council n. 899 of 6 August 2024, which renews and replaces the previous resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022, as amended by resolution no. 454 of 29 April 2024, which in the regulatory provisions of the Company applicable to the case in question.

The new regulation of the recruitment and also of the internal progressions of Finaosta is valid on November 4 and the guidelines on which it is based are the ones that have been approved previously at August 2024, so you understand that first the rules are made and then apply, not first the rules are applied and then they are made, because in the order and in the hierarchy of the sources there is national law, there are regional law, there are the resolutions and the regulations are internal to the companies. Participate and it is the same thing that was already generated on another appointment of the regional financial financial in which a degree was provided for a specific apical figure and I remember that the statute had not yet been changed. The order of the times is therefore not trivial, because otherwise we do not give ourselves rules. Objectively, why did I refer to the previous guidelines of December 2022 and the regulation that was valid when I presented the initiative? Because that was the regulation at that moment.

However, I wish good work to the financial and, I repeat, because perhaps it is not clear, that it is not a problem of updating the information by the undersigned, but it is of applying the laws and application of the rules in the order of the times when these are approved, because the regulation on November 4th did not do it, whoever did it unfortunately in that seat there had previously applied it, which is a little strange thing.

47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,5859,"Obviously, as a group, we will make an article evaluation by article of the provision, however I believe it is useful, indeed indispensable, to focus on an article that we have already discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the competent council commission, which is article 11. Article 11, which is included within this law, of this omnibus, which tends to bring results, the necessary, urgent changes, in short, a maintenance of the articulated. The question, to read this article, arises decidedly spontaneous and I hope that my intervention can serve as a starting point for reflection: what exactly this article is for? We read it in the report that is attached precisely in the articulated and the purpose of this article is: ""In order to specify, in implementation of the commitment assumed by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of real collaboration, that the derogation provided for by the modified article in the general rule, which sets the maximum duration of the fixed -term employment contracts of the 36 -month public employees, concerns the employment contracts aimed at the realization of the interventions referred to in Article 1, falling within the plan. national recovery and resilience "". In essence, it seems that, reading this article ... that without this intervention, the employees in question - we are talking about ARER -, therefore the ARER employees who deal with renovations, could not remain in service - who have been hired by the fixed -term project - beyond the date of December 31, 2026, or that they could not be extended beyond 36 months. In reality, the article that is modified recites precisely ... So this amendment here, article 11, is part of an existing law. What does this existing law say? In paragraph 2 he says: ""In order to ensure the recruitment of the personnel necessary for the functioning of the project structure referred to in paragraph 1, in times compatible with the start of the interventions referred to in Article 1, limited to the year 2022, the hiring of two units of two -term non -management staff is authorized, for a period of 36 months, extendable not beyond the date of 31 December 2026. To the discipline provided for by the regional regulation 12 February 2013 n. 1 - which are the provisions for access to the Single Divoria Valle d'Aosta -, without prejudice to the assessment of the knowledge of the French language pursuant to article 16 of the same regional regulation). Arer. What changes? Very simple: the decree-law 44/2023, converted into law 74/2023, in article 3, paragraph 5, amendment, with exclusive reference to the regions, autonomous provinces, metropolitan cities and municipalities, the discipline referred to in article 20 of the legislative decree 25 May 2017 n. 75, which - feel good - as a transitory basis allows public administrations the stabilization of staff already in service as a fixed -term employees at the same administration. The new rule allows this possibility to the aforementioned territorial until 31 December 2026. What happens then? The regions, provinces, municipalities and metropolitan cities, until 31 December 2026, can proceed, within the available limits of the current organic endowment, upon selective interview - we imagine somewhat selective -, and the outcome of the positive evaluation of the work activity carried out for the stabilization of the qualification covered with non -managerial people, who, within the aforementioned term, has accrued at least 36 months of service, even if not continuous, in the last 8 years at the administration to the hiring, which has been taken on a fixed term following competition procedures compliant with the principles referred to in Article 35, Legislative Decree 30 March, n. 165. Verbis Brevis or Brevis Verbis, the formula you prefer. Without this legislative modification, the staff who substantially say that the people who dealt with the Pinqua and 110% from ARR at the end of their service would have finished their service and of course, if they had then wanted to be absorbed by ARER, they would have had to make a competition. With this change it is simply said that the funds for the above projects are for the realization of the PNRR and are not funds for the Pinqua and for 110 and, on the basis of this, these people can be hired indefinitely. This necessity certainly does not come from the state, it is not that the state tells you: ""Listen, since you have to hire me two Aren employees, change this rule, so at least I stabilize them"".  I strongly doubt that the state worries, since you write that there is the principle of loyal collaboration with the state, of the hiring, of the stabilization of two ARER employees. We are therefore faced with a rule that has, as they say, nom and cognom and that does not change anything, it is a bit like turning the mattress from the winter side to the summer side, unless you are the mattress, then there the thing changes and actually, the mattresses are there and are two and they can be stabilized and hired indefinitely by the public administration with this modification, which does not change anything, it is not necessary. We, of course, ad hoc rules for mattresses we will not vote for it, if you do it ... we do a big good luck but we believe that evidently here has been made a rule of us call it pre-electoral."

I briefly intervene on article 11, a commitment already undertaken on the occasion of regional law 12 of 29 July with the variation of the budget. On the question, the Legislative Office had confronted the competent offices of the relative ministries, with a reserved correspondence, a commitment therefore to better detail a rule, a precise provision, which gives the possibility of derogating from the 36 months in the use of the staff, which is consequent to the activity connected to the current construction sites with PNRR funding of ARER, in particular of the Pinqua funding, which is financed with the 23.2 million and the nine lots of work In the most part already started with ongoing works, therefore a correspondence that remains, which is, as mentioned, reserved and was to define better and concretize this procedure."

I would like to dwell on article 6, which is an article that has a very important impact for the future of behaviors in our territory, a mountain territory, a territory that has a morphology, characteristics, very important climatic variables and this article underlines the importance of the principle of self -responsibility in the territory and on the usability of our paths, our roads, Outdoor activities and goes to clears a path of responsibility within the users, especially of the users. activities that take place in our territory. I believe it is a concept that in other contexts, even European, is already very developed and that must enter a little in custom, in the mentality of those who carry out activities and that must consciously assume the responsibilities of the danger and any critical issues that can be there in confronting the territory, a concept of zero risk that does not exist and that is also part of this particular moment of climate change, even geomorphological, which characterize above all very particular territories Aosta Valley. Within this bill there are other much more punctual indications, this is a slightly wider principle that seemed to me correct to underline and make it detect the importance in this particular temporal context."

Two more words are spent because perhaps with this article we try to fill a legislative gap at national level, a gap that has led to a jurisprudence that is much discussed and sometimes I allow myself to say has brought jurisprudential distorts. It is clear that, by introducing this concept of self -responsibility, we allow each individual who faces the mountain, or of the ski courses, or other paths in the Aosta Valley also with the bicycle the freedom to independently determine his way of facing the path, to face the mountain, but which obviously imposes at the same time the full responsibility for what were the choices made. Doubts emerge when this person is accompanied by someone who has responsibility for accompanying. All this to say that it was an important step, but that perhaps the path is still long, so this article is welcome, but the invitation is, all together, to work on it still to take a further step forward and encourage those in the context - I see that the councilor who deals with the mountains - just about these skills has booked ... maybe our representatives in Rome can work perhaps in future legislative productions to go to clarify this aspect."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,14,1575,"This theme was placed in the coordination, in the commission that deals with the problems of the mountain. I illustrated an amendment proposed by the Aosta Valley in the hearing that took place in the Senate during the examination of the bill that deals with making the law on the 1994 mountain more modern. I must say that with the different interactions that we had both with the representatives of the Südtiroler Volkspartei, and in particular the Senator Durnwalder, but also obviously in connection with Senator Spelgatti, there was a work of the commission and then was a work of commission and Aula that has allowed to have, within the text already approved by the Senate, a legislation that concerns this issue that should also cover that part that cannot be covered by regional law, in particular criminal issues, which obviously cannot be subject to regional regulations. We are examining, even with colleagues who deal with the issues of the path and tourist impact, if it will be the case even better to specify the text of the articulated that has already been approved, which however is already a significant step forward. Now the law ends up in the Chamber, I will have the honor, as a representative for the mountain of all Italian regions and autonomous provinces, to be audited to the Chamber, and we will return to the point if the case. Already the current text is significant and in any case it must be appreciated, and I am pleased that she is, that in the meantime the region plays stakes within its legislation."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Cretier,Paolo,1963.0,M,FP-PD,16,3482,"Good morning everyone. In the meantime, a short declaration I would say on the meantime on this beautiful day that awaits us work in this beautiful week. The Omnibus contains a series of changes, additions or repeal made necessary to respond to the maintenance needs of the legislation in force, which requires retouches to improve some regulatory steps and its applicability. This is my thoughts. For example, article 6, in which the accompanying persons are responsible, or also ourselves, in particular in mountain environments, but by extended throughout the regional territory, thinking - and sometimes having the ability - to give up reaching a destination and the set goal. The renunciation saves life, our life, but also of those who have to intervene in extreme conditions. I quote an article read on a local weekly: ""Only the rescue of the Guardia di Finanza has rescued 48 people"" and I would also like to mention Hervé Barmasse for his declaration of renunciation in an interview in a climb in Nepal, who had to give up for obvious reasons, however, in a time, every now and then the decision must be taken and we must renounce. We are at the forefront of information, the civil protection system, very efficient that we have operational here in the valley, always is not enough, the foundation of article 6 is the self -responsibility codified by the civil code and in this case of the realization of others' interests without risking their lives or of those who accompany us and at the same time of the experiences expert, formed but operational in extreme conditions. Article 8, the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads. The complicated reticulum of the somewhat dated regional roads physiologically requires ordinary and sometimes extraordinary maintenance interventions, with important financial interventions to ensure the practicability and safety of the citizen, the worker, the student and the tourist who climbs to the valley. Of course, it is also necessary to think about alternatives to avoid closure, the isolation of economic activities and give the possibility of returning, which are sometimes prevented from very dangerous calamities situations. Article 9, the theme of agriculture and the company connected to it. Timing times are now guaranteed by a regional complement that will be approved soon, today I hope. Sometimes the changes in data management create too many time hitches of pure reading of the data, of the value of the application, so it is necessary to extend to 31 December 2025 for those companies in difficulty. In cases of return of early sums, these companies - few for the real compared to the total - can have a breath of oxygen. Article 11, a derogation necessary to carry out the interventions falling within the PNRR, strengthening the administrative capabilities of public administrations, functional to the implementation of the same. These are just some examples that are connected to the III Commission of which I am a member and the mission are in particular agriculture, the health of the territory, public works and civil protection, linked directly to the aforementioned articles. As a group, we will vote for the bill for the necessary changes to openings and approvals to be made today. The progressive federalist group Democratic Party will certainly vote for this bill."

47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Malacrinò,Antonino,1977.0,M,FP-PD,2,12373,"Good morning everyone. This bill bears the second provision of variation to the budget of the Region for the three -year period 2024/2026 and is made up of twenty items that contain provisions for the registration of higher revenues and higher costs to the budget. The major resources are mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that affected the Aosta Valley on 29 and 30 June 2024. The document also contains the provisions for the ratification of the budget changes, carried out with resolution of the regional council, which authorized the variations arranged to make the funds available for the first post -flood interventions. This legislative provision is characterized by the registration of greater entrances in the three-year period 2024-2026 for 35.9 million euros which will be intended for the financing of the interventions listed in Chapter I. A total of, for the year 2024, the authorizations relating to the recurring expenses increased by 2.1 million euros, the investment costs 32.8 million euros and the expenses for the increase in financial activities of 1 million euros. Specifically, this bill consists of five heads: Chapter I relates to new expenses authorizations and consists of ten items. Article 1, in paragraph 1, establishes that the allocation for the granting of contributions to families and production activities for interventions relating to the overcoming of the emergency, resulting from the alluvial event of 29 and 30 June 2024, is increased by 3.9 million. Paragraph 2 provides for the possibility, if new resources are made available by the State, to take them directly, without having to pour them to the beneficiaries that have already been restored with regional funds. Article 2 establishes extraordinary transfers in favor of local authorities to meet the important investments necessary for the realization of interventions to restore damage caused by the flood. Paragraph 1 gives the right to the Civil Protection and Fire Brigade Department, following a reconnaissance of the damages suffered by the same department, to transfer to the Municipality of Cogne, as established in letter a), a total amount equal to € 13.8 million for the realization of interventions concerning the restoration, after the first emergency works, of the municipal roads, of the seriously damaged sub -services, as well as the works of works, Hydraulic regulation usually carried out by the competent regional structures in the field of public works, territory and the environment. In letter b) it also provides for the transfer to the Municipality of Valtournenche, also seriously affected by the alluvial event at the end of June, for the necessary interventions to restore the functionality of the aqueduct and sewage network, of a total amount equal to 4.4 million and also provides for letter c), an overall transfer, equal to 500 thousand euros, to finance the interventions related to the restoration subsequent to the remaining events in the remaining common events in the remaining municipalities of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta. Paragraph 2 defines the methods of transferring the funds intended for the Municipality of Cogne and the Municipality of Valtournenche, establishing the possibility, at the request of the municipalities themselves, to provide an anticipation of up to 50% of the envisaged amount and to postpone the balance of the allocation to the reporting to the Regional Civil Protection and Fire Brigade of the interventions carried out. Paragraph 3 establishes that, with resolution of the regional council, to be adopted upon the opinion of the permanent Council of local authorities, the list of interventions carried out in the other municipalities of the Region is drawn up, with the exclusion of Cogne and Valtournenche, and the criteria and methods of transfer of the related resources are defined. Article 3 provides for the granting of a contribution of Euro 500 thousand to the Municipality of Cogne for the organization of the ""World Ski World Cup"", assigned by the International Ski Federation, which will take place from January 31 to February 2, 2025 in consideration of the important tourist-promational repercussions and the related economic benefits, resulting from the performance of the aforementioned competitions in the locality affected by the flood events. Article 4 authorizes and finances two urgent interventions for the safety of strategic infrastructures and the territory. The first intervention aims to review the structural structure of the state property channel RU ARBERIOZ, to complete the expected emergency action conducted during the calamitous event of 29 and 30 June, to guarantee the provision of water for agricultural, zootechnical and fire -fighting uses in the municipalities of Aymavilles, Jovençan and Gressan. The second intervention, on the other hand, provides for the reconstruction of the state -channel of RU Baudin, guaranteeing hydraulic safety conditions and water function for agricultural and zootechnical use in a territorial area with a high residential density and to protect the strategic infrastructures connected with the hydraulic artifacts of the Municipality of Aosta. Article 5 authorizes the granting of contributions aimed at the demolition of the interests and preliminary costs practiced by Finaosta on mortgages in support of companies that have undergone damage or indirect by the flood of June 2024, meaning ""indirect damages"" a drop in turnover of at least 20% resulting from the comparison between the data relating to the months of July 2023 and July 2024. The means of Finaosta and to be worth on the ordinary management referred to in article 5 of the regional law of 16 March 2006 n. 7. For the disbursement of the contributions, a specific temporary endowment fund for the duration of the amortization plans of the financing to the companies affected by the flood will be established at the Regional Financial Financial, and the resources not used are provided to the Fund referred to in article 68 of the regional law 13 February 2013, n. 3 (provisions on housing policies). The burden deriving from the application of this article is determined for the year 2024 in Euro 955,212.95. Article 6 authorizes the increase in the allocation for the interventions provided for by the regional law of 29 March 2018 n. 6 (Regional interventions in support of sports infrastructures in the cable car complexes of over -room apartment and refinancing of the regional law of 18 June 2004, n. 8 (regional interventions for the development of cable car facilities and related service facilities), inserting, in derogation of the procedures provided for by the aforementioned law, the possibility of providing extraordinary contributions in capital account aimed at the recovery of the sports infrastructures damaged by the event 29 and 30 June. Paragraphs 5 and 6, respectively, changes to paragraph 3 of article 4 and paragraph 1 of article 5 of regional law 6/2018, in order to adapt the limits of the aid to investments for the sports infrastructures provided for by the same law to those defined by the EU Regulation 651/2014. 21 in support of companies and freelancers participating in the collective guarantee bodies of the trusses of the Region, in order to avoid the proportional reduction of the contributions granted the major request recorded during the year 2024 Refurbishment of the fume detection system, for the modernization of the fire -fighting system, for the replacement of the emergency lights, for the supply of size doors and for the replacement of anti -trauma protection facilities in the sports fields, for a total expenditure of € 200 thousand. Article 9 bears the financing of Euro 700 thousand necessary for the realization of compulsory additional works for fire-fighting purposes and for the payment of the charges connected to the revaluation of prices regarding the regional swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier in the context of the architectural, energy and structural improvement intervention. Article 10 provides for the recognition of an extraordinary contribution for Euro 70 thousand to patronage and social assistance institutions for the year 2024 for the major support and information activities carried out, to guarantee citizens access to the allowances and measures provided for in support of the less well -off categories. Chapter II provides for the registration of the major revenues on the three -year period 2024/2026 and is made up of a single article: Article 11, which provides for the recording of greater revenue in Euro 35,902,212.95 deriving from the recognition of taxes donated on the basis of the revenue of the year 2023, including a report referring to the previous years. Chapter III provides for the ratification of budget variations and is made up of a single article: Article 12, which ratifies the content of a series of budget variations adopted by the regional council, pursuant to article 36 of the regional law 12/2024, to face the works of first intervention and rescue of the alluvial event of 29 and 30 June. The total amount of the decrease variations is equal to € 21,041,164.95. Chapter IV bears other provisions and final provisions and consists of two articles. Article 13 redetermines, integrating the amount, the financial resources intended for interventions on local finance referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1, of the regional law of 19 December 2023, n. 25 (Regional Stability Law for the three -year period 2024/2026). Article 14 bears the reconnaissance of expenditure authorizations gained by regional laws. Chapter V provides other final provisions and provisions and consists of six articles. Article 15 provides for amendments to article 19 of the regional law of 12 June 2024, n. 7 (adjustment of the forecast budget of the Region for the year 2024), changes aimed at enhancing the property called Palazzo Cogne to be allocated to university residence. Article 16 provides that the duration of the mandate to the Board of Auditors for the Region, now scheduled for three years, is established in three accounting exercises, so as to allow the extension of the revision activity on an entire accounting year. The extension of the assignment to the members of the college currently in charge, expiring in February 2025, for a further mandate is also provided. Article 17 bears provisions regarding the alienation of real estate between the Region and local authorities, providing for an expansion of the scope of the regional law of 23 November 1994, n. 68, in terms of alienation of properties between the Region and Municipalities. In particular, this change allows to improve the synergy between local entities and the enhancement of the property owned by them, with the possibility of extending the use of some goods for institutional purposes also to other entities. Article 18 bears urgent amendments to the regional law 19 August 1998 n. 46 (Rules on secretaries of local authorities of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta) and to the regional law of 14 November 2023 n. 22 (New provisions regarding the recruitment of the secretaries of the local authorities of the Aosta Valley), to integrate the discipline relating to the recruitment of new secretaries of local authorities, in view of the next municipal general elections of autumn 2025. Article 19 lists attachments to this law. Finally, article 20 bears the declaration of urgency. The II permanent council commission, which met on November 18, 2024, examined the regional law no. 171 presented by the Regional Council on 6 November 2024, concerning: ""Second variation to the budget of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta for the three -year period 2024/2026"" and expressed a favorable opinion by majority."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,4,10297,"The press release of the II Commission of 12 November 2024, in addition to giving news of the appointment of the speakers of this bill, rightly represented this as composed of provisions concerning the registration of greater revenues and higher expenses in the budget 2024/2026, mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that hit our valley on 29 and 30 June. The adverb gives awareness that within the provision there are not only rules or measures aimed at restoring infrastructures and places affected by the sad events of June, or contributions to cope with the damage suffered by families and businesses, but also of the other. In this sense, the next comment, what I will go to represent, will be divided into two parts: that relating to the articles concerning emergencies and that inherent in the other interventions. For the record, it must be said that in the aforementioned press release, in particular in the declarations of the President of the Commission, the majority colleague, among other things, there is no trace of the fact that, in addition to the auditions of the political counterparties, the councilors and mayors in various capacities concerned, who would then be held during the morning of Monday 18, the possibility of auditing also the representatives of the category associations affected by the commissioners was denied majority by voice of the President of the II Commission. The opposition forces have criticized and also criticized this choice today, because it has limited the possibility by the commission to better understand the problems connected to the negative effects brought by the alluvial event of June. A passage that could have been managed in a different way, in line with what, among other things, already made in the past for situations of similar scope. This said for the right duty of news and facts. The first two articles are closely linked to the alluvial event. Article 1, allocating resources to contribution to families and productive activities through regional law 5/2021, that of the organization of regional civil protection activities, article 2, transferring resources to support the investments of the local authorities affected, including in particular the Municipality of Cogne, the Municipality of Valtournenche, as well as also in favor of other local authorities. Overall, regional resources that will then be covered with national funds that will come from the procedures put in place by our Civil Protection with the national counterpart. Resources that, on the basis of the trends of the interventions, may also, in the near future, have to be increased, as it emerged during the auditions organized in the Commission. With Article 3, resources are allocated in favor of the Municipality of Cogne as a competition for the coverage of the expenses incurred by the same for the organization of the ""Nordic skiing World Cup"" race. Some considerations: undoubtedly the inclusion of this provision in the context of this provision was also determined by the timing of assignment of the tender by the International Ski Federation, as this opportunity undoubtedly constitutes an important opportunity to relaunch the tourist resort affected by the events last June. However, it is acknowledged - and some colleague will surely add commentary details during the general discussion - that to date the methods of support and sports competitions of this level, and not only, are increasingly characterized by ad hoc measures, cum titulo, etc., making every situation in its own right, without a clear basic strategy and/or potential effects deriving from the synergy with other measures or initiatives. Article 4 allocates important funding of two state channels: the RUs Arberioz and Baudin) whose intervention details have been deepened in the dedicated hearing. Article 5 constitutes a temporary rotation fund, in line with the duration of the loans granted, for the reduction of the interest of the preliminary costs practiced by the regional financial financial for the granting of funding in favor of companies affected by the flood. A measure presented to the attention of the group leaders during the last update meeting of the situation by the President of the Region (for the record, already in part early also during the September meeting); An information in line with the commitment signed and approved by majority with the resolution of the Valle Council of 10 July last. Commitment that, although flying over the expected weekly cadence of the information on the evolution of the management of the emergency, it was still concretized with meetings held on July 5, July 15, August 14, September 17th and 1st of October. The measure provided for in article 5 was presented in the October meeting, then subsequently the final text through the short streets to the minority group leaders. In this sense, it is good to specify that there has not been a sharing of intent on this measure, but a sharing in the information sense, following which the minority forces took note of the proposal today under consideration by the Valle Council; Certainly we will also return to the point in the general discussion. Of course it is - and it is good to question the topic - that time matters for the proper functioning of these tools and today the time runs more than the speed of legislative production. For this reason we can do nothing more now than to wish us a quick made available to this measure in favor of the companies that will request it. Article 6 will allow the restoration of sports infrastructures damaged by the alluvial event through the refinancing of regional laws 6/2018 and 8/2004. I now pass to further interventions. Article 7 defines the enhancement of the provision of the Fund for the granting of contributions in interest to law 21 in favor of Valle d'Aosta companies through confidi. Articles 8 and 9 relate to the interventions to be conducted at the regional boarding school Federico Chabod in Aosta and on the Pé-Saint-Didier swimming pool, certainly interventions that must be performed, and therefore financed, but that we would have preferred to find in the context of a provision not necessarily linked to the emergency events of June. This is because there are certainly other measures that would need equal consideration, but which today have not been brought to the attention of the perimeter of this second variation. At the same time we would have preferred, as part of a measure so mainly linked to the alluvial emergency, other measures in favor of the realities affected by the flood last June. The same concerns article 10, which allocates funds for patronage institutions and social assistance. As regards articles 15, on Palazzo Cogne, and 16, that of the Board of Auditors, and 17 in the field of alienations of real estate between the Region and local authorities, we asked ourselves during the auditions and we renew here the doubt of why they were not included in the context of the maintenance law of the regional system just discussed. I am now going to deepen the provisions on the recruitment of the secretaries of the local authorities, of which we have, among other things, acknowledged the presentation of an amendment this morning by the President. With the bill 147 maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024, the one presented by the government on May 24 and then voted in June, was repealed ... the repeal ... of paragraph 5 of article 1 of law 46/1998. A topic of the municipal secretaries is certainly a topic and in the broad sense that concerning the legislation of our local authorities, also and above all for the stratification over time of new laws and various articles of modification presented for this purpose. However, it should be said that during the auditions and then in the debate in the classroom on that article 5 of the bill 147 we had asked for explanations and further clarifications several times about the consequences that this repeal would have led to in view of the preparation of the call to recruit the new municipal secretaries, but nothing. Today we find a further modification that also arises from the path made later in the Commission - and I would say that we find a further one this morning -, a path stimulated by the request for auditions on the point by the undersigned and colleagues Erika Guichardaz and Claudio remain. This, among other things, after the Secretaries Agency itself, with a note from last October, rightly asked the Region for a ruling, they asked for a legal opinion on this point, in fact it took the form of these two proposals. What emerged is that the regulatory framework deriving from the June modification was far from clear as it had been said and it could have even had possible problems and further aftermath of the publication of the announcement by the secretaries agency. On this I am an engraved: in all the auditions that have been made in the Commission, we said it: our request is not a will to disturb, but a will to clarify and avoid the generation of possible disputes after the publication of the announcement. We are today at the nth degree, what to say? What represented in this report certainly does not pretend to include all the positions of the minority forces and in this sense the consequent debate will certainly allow to further deepen more than one aspect already considered here, but also wants to try to provide those who read and to those who listen to good elements of reflection and the right duty of news on the contents of this bill. I obviously reserve the right to intervene also following the debate on more politically sensitive points for our group."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,7188,"Obviously I thank the minority speaker who in his report wanted to represent all the parts of the opposition that will discuss the provision today, I see many colleagues already booked, because obviously there are also differences in position between the oppositions, but what is clear is that there are many dark sides on this provision that we are going to discuss. Some have already been raised, on others I will make a further study, this is a provision, which, as we know, has been expected for some time, we have spoken of it, as rightly has been said, in the days immediately following the alluvial events and it arrives late compared to some needs that have been repeatedly reported and as if that were not enough, after a long discussion, the bill 171, which should have been destined exclusively for the emergency of the flood. Various other articles that contain a little bit of everything: from the swimming pools to the boarding school, from the municipal secretaries to the study, with interventions of regulatory modification that should have found a place in the Omnibus law, discussed as you have seen before this, there would have been no problem, no critical issues in transposing the rules that change the regional rules in the Omnibus and instead it was preferred to insert them in this provision. This insertion evidently causes reactions, because if it had preferred to focus on a law exclusively on the flood, as was also requested by the opposition groups in the Commission, freedom would also have left the council groups to share or not to share the content of a potential emergency law, instead it was preferred, and we must perhaps say it even in an instrumental way, trying to fill as much as possible without any coherence and If this is due to an administrative inability - and this have denounced it several times - which is always manifested in the form of self -amendments and bills filed by the government, we see it, a law is filed and then the amendments of the same government arrive who filed the law, perhaps even without auditions, which is a stuff that honestly leaves a little amazed, or here it would be even more serious - To avoid that the minority could with its contribution to some merit to have tried to support families and businesses in the territories affected by the flood. If this was the concern, president, I immediately take away the embarrassment. Here at least in my group - but I am sure that it is the same for the other opposition groups - nobody wants to steal the alleged glory or the merits that he wants to propagate in splendid solitude, such as, for example, it happened last Saturday for the party in which he participated, with a few other members of the majority, in Cogne, worried that someone could shade them, but I think it is right to say, At least, at least listen to the very few basic requests that came from the opposition was asked, because, yes, the group leaders were updated sporadically and laconically, with information that a minute later, but often a few minutes earlier, they were disseminated by the information bodies and on several occasions - I say it at the umpteenth benefit of the minutes, the colleague aggravated has already done it - there has been talk of sharing in classroom forces with the opposition forces, but Sharing stopped at an audition, as said sporadic, of the group leaders, without any expression of assent on our part or sharing choices or proposals. On the other hand, President, this provision brings with it a very serious lack, a lack that alone makes some of the choices almost without legitimacy, as well as revealing an evident terror of submitting them to the opinion of those who propose them. I, president, deems it necessary to highlight the seriousness of what happened in the Commission, when you have decided that on a provision that contains articles that are titled: ""Provisions regarding contributions to support companies affected by flood"", companies did not ask for what they thought. Well yes, colleagues and also Valley citizens who hope you listen to us outside of this classroom, what I just described has really happened. I am not inventing anything, I was sitting right here when the request of the minority to audire the trade associations, and the specific: Adava, Confcommercio and Confesercenti, the majority replied no, not limiting itself to a refusal but adding that - heard heard - these auditions were not relating to the law. A law that should provide businesses to companies must not be placed on the examination of the representatives of the companies themselves, because this majority knows, at its unquestionable judgment, that what it does is right and the others arrange themselves. So, since you have not had the courage to submit this paston to the trade associations, we do it, making a nice truth operation so that outside of this classroom we know what the majority intends to do in favor of the companies affected by the flood. Well, do you know dear entrepreneurs and dear Aosta Valley, what do aid for businesses and economic activities affected by flood consists? In loans, yes, exactly, loans that, however, will come perhaps, if this law will be approved, in a few days, therefore, as said, in serious delay since the tourist season has already begun and that they will not serve those who the tourist season if it has seen it take away from collapses of roads or bad advertising of the information bodies, which have painted our region as a huge aquitrine. If you had made an investment to better face the season, but you saw your turnover reset, if you were preparing for the current season and your business had been destroyed by the flood and your products drowned in the mud, so you can take some money that you will then have to return, widening the passive created by the flood. All this should be a help that no trade association has had the opportunity to analyze to express an opinion for fear that could highlight their doubts or even one's opposition. I say this for the benefit of the information bodies that perhaps have been badly informed. It is not a rain of money, it is not even a dew of money, these are only funds with the elastic that unfortunately I am afraid that they will not help anyone: that's why, in the face of this very serious choice, whose responsibility falls within the highest representative of this majority, we have deposited an agenda that, instead of preparing money with the elastic: ""I give them and I laugh at them"", asks for real refreshments, compensation for those who, in a condition, It is seen erase years of sacrifices and job prospects. We will therefore evaluate the will of this majority there."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,8,5507,"I also start the intervention by thanking the speakers who illustrated the bill that was downloaded, a bill that we imagined was concentrated and placed all his attention on the alluvial emergency, but, as was anticipated by those who intervened, contains articles that are mainly interested in mitigating the effects of the flood, but then there are also a whole series of articles that arouse perplexity at the organizational and procedural level, because We also believe that they could be contained in the omnibus provision and this denotes a little perhaps an incede with an organizational method that suggests. Beyond this, there are also a whole series of rates of ratification of budget changes made with the resolutions of the council. The provision in its consistency manages 35.9 million euros which are put in the shopping account, of which € 2,100,000 on current expenses and € 32.8 million in capital expenses. I would like to draw attention to the first articles a little, which are those relating to the alluvial emergency. Article 1 allocates € 3.9 million additional euros for law 5/2021, that of civil protection, to find the needs of families and businesses, after which the other articles are substantially focused on the public state property, on the municipal restorations of all public works that have been damaged by the flood, in particular 13.8 million for Cogne and 4.4 million for Valtournenche are allocated. The article 3 euros 500 thousand in favor of Cogne for the organization of the ""World Cup""; Article 4 RU D'ARBERIOZ AND RU BAUDIN, provides for investments also here of accommodation, after which we move on to Article 5. Article 5 is an article that basically provides for an interest coverage for mortgages that will be open to those who have undergone direct and indirect damage from the flood, to companies that have seen a reduction in turnover compared to 2023, therefore both contributions for the reduction of interest, will be managed by Finaosta. We believe that, as a measure, it can also be a good measure, but this is not the tool that, from our point of view, had to be used to manage this situation. A situation in which we would have hoped for a behavior by the complementary and supplementary region of the behavior that has been implemented at national level, because there are a whole series of companies and economic operators who have undergone relevant damage especially in these two communities: the Cogne community and that of Valtournenche, which cannot be mortified in this way, but must be helped by the public administration. For this reason, therefore, also in the change in the budget we presented an agenda that we had already presented on the occasion of the discussion of the Defr, in which we had wanted to anticipate the matter because the elements were clear on the table of how the management of this administrative practice was developing. Today we also had the pleasure of listening, aside all the colleagues who intervened of the opposition, that there was no sharing - as had been a little dot to understand when we had brought the theme on the occasion of the discussion of the Defr - by the oppositions compared to the substance of this initiative of article 5, had been a sharing of information, had been implemented by information by the regional government, in particular of the commissioner, who had said: "" Solution of this problem in this direction "", a direction that we, already then, had seen that it did not correspond to the needs of local operators. For this reason, therefore, we have presented an agenda that goes in the direction of introducing refreshments to those who cannot obtain refreshment at national level because it is a competent level that is not foreseen in the field of the Ministry of Tourism. We will then return to this later. As for article 5, in itself it is an article that can be sustainable, but which substantially has a different purpose than that of the refreshment, because it is a question of having a tool for opening mortgages, which are anything else compared to that of obtaining refreshment. After that there is article 7, an article also that we can share, because, although it is not linked to the purely emergency issue, it meets the Valle d'Aosta production system, putting a transfer to the confidi to bring down the cost of the interests that companies have incurred and support with difficulty in this period following the increase in the interest rate also in the Aosta Valley. Then there are all the other articles, which are the articles that have been mentioned, which basically go to regulate the issues that do not affect the emergency situation, but which could be treated, in our opinion, within the Omnibus or even within the budget. On these we will then enter to express the judgments at the time of the vote of the articulated. As for us, our approach will depend a lot on what will be the attitude and attitude of the majority towards the agenda we have presented."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,10,9476,"The second change in the budget came after the approval of the Budget Council and also on this I believe that confirms the doubts about the organizational and planning skills of this junta. Despite the urgency of the situation, the bill 171 arrives four months after alluvial events, leaving too many to manage and, as reported in the commission last council, arrives without sharing on such an important issue, but simply with some information meeting. In July, among other things, with the colleagues of Rassemblement we had worked on a resolution with the majority precisely to ask to be updated weekly on the developments of the alluvial events and the various interventions, but, as the councilors aggravated and Manfrin rightly remembered, the meetings were five, often they were also urged in the light of the fact that the news came out on the press bodies and none of us knew anything about us. Sharing then that, however, as it was rightly underlined by all the group leaders who preceded me, there was not even in the commission since the auditions proposed by the minority were largely denied, while for us it would have been important to hear those bearers who in recent months have had to give answers. In other emergency situations - and I speak above all of the first part of the legislature, when President Lavevaz was at the head of this junta - these shares, especially on interventions that concerned the entire community, were there and were shared so much that they have also often obtained the unanimous vote of the classroom. We enter into the merits of the change in the budget that has been proposed, meanwhile we note that there is a handful of articles dedicated to the emergency, which somehow provide small contributions to families, businesses and extraordinary transfers to the municipalities, all partial and in many cases insufficient. Regional resources then, which, as was rightly remembered by the minority speaker, will be covered by national funds, therefore in some way not resources of the region. Once again then there will be people who will not be able to benefit from any help, apart from perhaps the contribution of 5 thousand or 20 thousand euros, because, if they are already in difficulty situations, they will surely not turn on new indebtedness, which in some way can weigh precisely on their activities. In addition, I will tell me ... there has also been represented that we must think of insurance, which most likely on the calamitous and natural events as in this case do not respond, or that in some way it will be necessary to get by. For companies then we note that the season has already started and access to new mortgages, as I said, means having new indebtedness. To this then are associated with the problems with respect to the national funds announced with emphasis also by the coordinator of Fratelli d'Italia and the relative different statements that have followed one another in these days and of which perhaps the commissioner Grosjacques will be able to give us an answer, because it has been noted, or has been detected by the trade associations, a problem in the procedures to access these funds, very close times and also criteria of exclusion, such as those Sports such as riding stables and golf courses, but also many other entrepreneurial activities. According to someone, the regional government well knew this situation, but evidently did not want to intervene in any other way. This perhaps will clarify the commissioner Grosjacques. Another sore point that we highlighted in the last meeting is the question of layoffs still blocked for many workers and companies due to an inadequate state-region coordination since the answer was that the questions were incomplete, therefore perhaps, even compared to this delay, it would be important to understand what the real motivations are. Also with respect to the funds to the Municipalities, as has been well represented in the Commission, these will go to the multi -year fund bound, and then be included in the 2025 budget, given that the times are absolutely not there. Anyone who has managed a municipal budget knows very well that in this phase you cannot make new variations and therefore also here we will talk about next year. Finally, then we note a real confusion and a little pressure, which has already been detected by those who preceded me, which uses this change in the budget a little to put it within everything. There has been talk of the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, which we know, there is an article compared to the accounting auditors, compared to Ru d'Arberioz, who actually had the damage related to the flood, but then we find another RU and I thank the councilor for having passed the required documentation yesterday, but I did not have time to analyze it, so it will then be subject to some future initiative. As I said, I think this variation of the budget is it is clear that it is also linked to pressure and I want to dwell a little more on what concerns the recruitment of the municipal secretaries, the theme on which above all I and the director aggravation we did different initiatives precisely following all that has followed one another. On November 15, 2023 this majority approved Law 22, which introduced new provisions with respect to the recruitment of municipal secretaries; He also defined the degrees, he also defined that secretaries could access five years of experience in the last ten years, but only seven months later, on June 24, 2024, the same majority approved the regional law n. 9, yet another omnibus, which reintroduced an old article of the 1998 law, which actually created confusion and could lead to appeals. On this is enough to see that regional council to remember that the undersigned had presented a suppressive amendment, the classroom had been asked of the classroom to be able to discuss it since there was also the possibility of discussing it in the commission, therefore, if it is said that I did not bring the amendment to the commission, it is only because the auditions were not allowed even there. Then after the presentation of that amendment in the classroom there was the request for suspension, but then on the return, everything is fine, Madama the Marchesa, voted and had introduced that article. Now, the bill 171 is again modified what has been modified in November 2023, in June 2024 with yet another modification in November 2024, that is, in one year three laws were made to go somehow to fit even more an aspect that we all know is of absolute importance precisely for the restart of the next municipal councils. However, it is not the only thing, because, if there had been the only reintroduction of that article, it was a bit of a way to tell us: ""Perhaps we understood that there could have been confusion"", also supported by the president of the register of secretaries, by the secretaries of the first and of a second part who came to the hearing in the commission, but no, it is thought to add a paragraph 2 for a reserve that decides to be for the employees of category D which they played for five years that they played for five years. To the managerial qualification, telling us in the Commission that this formulation has been put for fear of appeals if another formulation was used. Today we find an amendment that instead brings us back to the question of municipal secretaries. In the commission we are told that that can be challenged, now the amendment comes, so I hope that the checks have been made on this, but I already announce that of course we will not vote for it precisely in light of what has been said in the commission when the president came. Among all this then ... from the discussion with the president of the register in the last hearing, we discover that two people, evidently not the two of which Manfrin talked about today, but two other people who are seen that they do not have certain requirements I imagine, will be excluded from this competition, because they are not five years old, nor the ten years because they have been evidently taken in the last legislature. On this step we do not intervene, so for these that, from what has been said by the president of the register, they are two people we do not intervene and I have absolutely not thought of doing any amendment to prevent me from being told that I do it for personal interests, as if who knows who I can have or favor within that category. All this I think clearly demonstrates the confusion that continues to reign even on an important theme like what has been a fact, unfortunately, not sporadic, because we know well that we must somehow also perhaps equip ourselves in the future, because things of this kind will be able to fall back, but what has been the attitude to respond to this criticality and if there has actually been an adequate response to the needs of the population we will find out only by living it. What I feel like saying is that the families and businesses that have undergone those damage deserved concrete interventions shared by all the classroom and really decisive, not empty proclamations and partial measures. Once again the people most in difficulty will have no answer."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,12,9198,"I said that I reserved it to make two passages on some aspects more both of interest in the action of our group, and also elements of novelty that obviously were not in my possession, in our possession before the start of this discussion and which will then be the subject of subsequent discussion. First of all I would like to dwell ... and, in reality, the intervention is mainly linked, if we want, to this passage ... so, in relation to the first two articles, but I would particularly say the first article, it must be said that, always for correctness of the action that each one has done, we had already expressed on several occasions the need to be able to use a tool that was already there and that it has rightly been adopted as the law 5/2001, which is born from an experience even more sad for our region for our region. And even more impactful, a tool that certainly needs to be updated, to be made more current also than the critical issues and risks that could not even be thought at that time and above all to make it above all on the measures and interventions ... Among other things, both with the president and with the commissioner Sapinet several times I have happened in initiatives a little to solicit the government benches, but on this there is an availability in our part, Pochettino more replicable in all situations, precisely to avoid real situations or in any case interventions a little too discretionary or in any case linked to the individual event, which risk putting even in difficulty and perhaps putting perhaps similar situations on different levels. I say this because, for better or for worse, we must treasure these situations and make this tool more and more modern and increasingly implemented. Welcome, we have already said it and the colleague has already done it also remain in the discussion of the maintenance law, for example, the principle of self -responsibility. There are all themes that need a total management. On this point, for heaven's sake, I also heard the interventions of other colleagues, who rightly said (synthesize): ""We need to do more, major and different aid could be predicted"". Two orders of the day were presented in particular. I say it now under the general discussion to then encourage in the presentation of the individuals, perhaps a reply or in any case the possibility of allowing me and allowing our group to have a little more clarity, because they are objectively and politically confused, because, on the one hand, it is right the criticism regarding the fact that you had to do more or could be done more, very right - and I did it too - the criticism of the need to audit. I found really strange and absurd to do not want to do it and I say it above all for how instead the board commissions have always behaved and have always tried to give voice in every situation, sometimes perhaps even with too much wealth in some situations; In this there was actually the need to make a passage for not only to remain linked to the pourparler or informal meetings, but giving a formality to this step. There was also time to do it and the availability to do it by the opposition forces, but objectively I find myself - and I say it immediately - in further difficulty feeling the closure of the intervention of colleague Marquis, which I do not see but that I am sure that his colleagues will bring him back ... the fact substantially to say: ""We will see what to do then on the vote based on your positioning on the agenda"". Although we have made a criticism, although we are critical on a whole series of passages and also of some articles of the budget variation ... and if, among other things, we had, in our opinion, not of the satisfactory answers, when we had invoked to use law 5 as soon as possible to avoid that it would pass too much time ... I confirm that articles 1 and 2 will vote for them because we are responsible, we have taken a responsibility and, beyond how it can be the positioning of the majority of the majority of the majority of the government On an initiative of one's movement, for the charity of God, if one believes in certain measures, you vote regardless, so I confirm that on these two passages we take responsibility and we will vote for them and we do not wash our hands with an objectively agenda. However, there is another thing that leaves me quite perplexed on these two steps. Those who propose them, have patience, but à Maintes Reprise reminds us that there are representatives at national level that are moving and, among other things, the agenda of colleagues from Forza Italia are moving on the day of the prompt visit of the Tourism Minister to Aosta on July 2nd and the provision of support to the economic operators of the tourism sector ... Let's say that those 10 million seemed a bit of the planes of Mussolini, Bring 15 million. Now, it is not a question of proxies, of those who deal with carpenter, hotels, bars, if there is a necessary help measurement, must touch, it must be carried out to all the operators involved. Now that a force, which still supports the government and supports the current minister of tourism, say: ""The minister has made everything, however, the government must predict to help or in any case to provide for support in favor of those realities whose ateco code is not included in the perimeter of the beneficiaries referred to in the decree of the Ministry of Tourism as not of competence"", it seems really absurd to me. Why did not something be done at national level to also involve the other minister or the other ministers who had the proxies to act? I objectively, I had been in the situation of colleagues, I would not have presented this agenda, because I objectively ask myself: but you have so many relationships with the Roman representatives, but what did you tell them on this point? And what did they answer? I cannot ask for forces that are not represented here, and obviously it would also be interesting to know on their part, but objectively I say to myself: ""What do you notice - someone would say - this agenda?"", But I am confused, so maybe you can give me an explanation. Then you are patient if I make a small political passage, but you know who is touched then rightly must also be defended, continue to talk about the united center -right, but there are two different agendas of the united forces of the center right, so even on this perhaps a passage I ... but just to help me overcome the confusion, because otherwise the confusion is even bigger ... I don't think of the undersigned perhaps but at the house of others and I say it in the last few advice to look at it. At the house of others, so then I allow myself to look at the house of others too, but you will rightly reply and you will convince us that this action is valid. Then, for heaven's sake, as two characters actually said that both Mao Tse-Tung and Von MolTke, a large Prussian marshal ... you have to march divided to hit united, but here it seems to me that it is not hit in the unit, but you will explain it to us. Still only three steps: one is linked to the theme of time I said before, the zero -rate mortgages, for heaven's sake, are welcome, are certainly useful for those who have the opportunity to sign them, however, beyond the fact that in any case the capital quota must be returned, first are made available and better is, because we are talking today on 20 November and who has thought about the season and anything else has already been equipped in a different way. We therefore hope that they can be made as quickly as possible. On the Pé-Saint-Didier swimming pool, all the minority groups have made initiatives, we had the opportunity to deepen the reason for this allocation, I objectively ... if I am not mistaken, the commissioner Sapinet spoke of the spring of 2025, we hope that this is the last and that we can finally get to the point, because otherwise things risk going even later. On the subject of municipal secretaries I think that the intervention of colleague Guichardaz can sign it, what is a passage that comes to me to say, especially after the last hearing, but I don't give it as criticism, I give it more as a theme of reflection. On the topic of municipal secretaries we continue to talk about the number of secretarial offices. Until the secretarial offices are defined, it is difficult to identify the optimum of the number to be banned, so this is a problem that, in reality, does not touch the law on secretaries so much, but in a broad sense the reforms or reform of the legislation of local authorities. Having said that, the solution will probably have a little further on, we try to be optimistic."
47986,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,14,3474,"Evidently Professor aggravation, who shoots sentences on the right and missing, strongly needs clarity with respect to his new political grouping, or he is part of the grouping of the Autonomist Valley Center, on the side of the opposition, but not so much of the opposition, because this intervention gives strong support to the majority and, on the other, with obviously the two councilors councilors in the majority and the other councilors who are part of the opposition, right away that there is already a relationship ... and that's what we had anticipated in the intervention of some time ago, that is, that there would probably have been different attitudes and behaviors ... This attack frankly we would not have expected. Entering the merits of what we are facing, on October 1, 2024 we are called by the President of the Council in a group leader, in which I participated, where the president communicated to us that a legislative provision would be put in place that went to support companies and anything else. Obviously it was an idea of ​​strong sharing, sharing that in reality - all the colleagues who intervened - there were no colleagues and that in some way saw us then confront us with a measure that anticipates answers and resources to businesses and inhabitants affected by Cogne and Valtournenche, but not all of them, because the rules do not allow it, because from 1 October to today and in the path from July, Tourism Minister that there would have been resources available, so I am sure that the representatives of the Council could have confronted each other to understand if everything was foreseen, even bars, rentals, sports facilities, or if those athec codes were not foreseen which then suddenly seem to have failed ... it is clear that that ministry cannot provide resources for that part. As I said last time in a regional council, sometimes we have to go knocking, we did it in the past, we have always done it, but not with the hat in hand, you have to go to say: ""Look that maybe there is a misunderstanding. I am sure that you can go in the direction to modify"". But what does the balance of this region makes available to these affected populations? How many resources does it put in place? Not advances, resources. It simply puts in the field that, it is true, do not cost companies, but somehow lead to the debt for businesses. I also do the declaration of vote because it was a bit what I had taken on to do with colleagues, a declaration of vote that is simple, of this bill all those articles that go in the direction of giving support to businesses and contributions compared to the flood of 29 and 30 June see us favorable, we will vote for them. Obviously we will not vote for the entire system of the standard, because we will vote for those articles that we believe are in support of the Aosta Valley. As for the political path, probably this Forza Italia, which sometimes is not even recalled, I see this common thread from PCP to Racing, I see this fil rouge that now runs and Forza Italia is probably annoyed. We are therefore happy with this, we want to characterize ourselves to be liberal, of the center -right, liberal, even autonomists, but constantly growing and this is very pleased."

I will therefore not enter into the merits of what already enunciated by the colleague, but I will focus a little on the system of the standard, that is to say, as perhaps perhaps mentioned by someone, a rule that presents itself as urgent to meet what has been the alluvial emergency, sees other initiatives involved in the articulated, which we - and above all I refer to the law of the extraordinary contribution in support of the competition of the ""Cup of the Cogne"" - Initiatives that could have a different dignity, to be treated with a separate standard. Why do we say this, especially about Cogne? Because previously, with other rules, we behaved in a different way, I dare say with a joke that there is a sort of political bipolarism. We found ourselves discussing the contribution of the sports clubs and was treated with a defined urgent and thus motivated standard by the councilor for the urgency to enroll in the competitions of an important championship. We dealt with the theme of the contribution to the ""World Cup"" of La Thuile, which was equally defined urgent and treated with an ad hoc standard. In that case, the urgency was defined by the need to approve, even without the auditions required by some colleague, because there was the need to conclude the contract with Warner Bros I think for the question of television shots. Also Cogne, who I consider a location worthy of attention, as has been said by the speakers and by the councilor himself in the hearing, could enjoy a rule in himself. We believe that a modification of the regional law 3, which can be defined as a single text of sport, which concerns, as already mentioned, the extraordinary contributions for sporting events, therefore also contains another rule of sport that concerns the contributions for the great events, is appropriate and it could have been possible before, therefore treating everyone in the same way, so it was not possible. If we had discussed an ad hoc rule on the ""Cogne World Cup"", we could have made our contribution, also through specific auditions, above all and even more so of who is in favor of this intervention, that we do not allow ourselves to criticize, but we support. We allow ourselves to emphasize that in doing so we proceed at least apparently, councilor, because I am sure that she has very clear ideas, in a disordered way. In the future, therefore, we ask you to arrive as soon as possible to this reform of sport, closing under a consolidated text all the rules concerning interventions in favor of sport, not only financial ones, but also other rules. That said, we are substantially in favor of this article, for the other articles we will evaluate, as said by my group leader, from time to time, but we would like to emphasize what expressed in this intervention so that it remains in the minutes and in the future to be able to check if our opinion has been taken into account."

47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,14022,"In reply to observations that have been brought in a way I would say a little broken within this morning of discussion, I know, in what were some observations, a little approximation in the topics covered and also a little poor punctuality and poor search for what was instead a very clear path, which wants to give answers, where they are useful, are possible, and are shared in their path, then more or less appreciated by those who must give the judgments. To be honest, however, I must say that the reconstruction developed by the colleague aggravation - made with a wealth of attention, of details - retraces the activities carried out during these months in a faithful way. I do not do it to annoy his colleague Baccega, who smiles at these statements of mine, but because intellectual honesty, in my opinion, always has to be underlined, even when not all situations have perhaps developed as they had planned. I believe that the important answers that are given within this change in the budget, which is a change in the budget which, for 95% of the financial resources questioned, corresponds to the needs resulting from the alluvial phenomenon that touched us on 29 and 30 June ... is a change of budget that leads to ratification all those variations, including for 21 million euros, which were activated immediately to give responses to the population, through the population, through the population. punctual built in the area, thanks to the activity of the regional structures and the activities carried out on site by the municipalities most touched by this phenomenon. Of those 21 million and broken that have been the subject of these budget variations that today we ratify - and that was a path foreseen within the rule that we approved a few months ago - these will be reimbursed, these already in an already conclaimed way by the national civil protection, for about 20.6 million euros. The other 35 million total that are made available are resources of which the availability is made by the regional administration and, for a part of these (in relation to the interventions mainly to be identified in the 13.8 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Cogne, 4.4 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Valtournenche and 500 thousand euros mainly made available to the other municipalities) a request to the national civil protection that has not yet has any type of cover and for which there is still no type of cover will still be brought certainty that they are referring to the regional administration. Therefore this is, if we want to say, a provision of resources that, where where they should be made in the account of the refreshments and reimbursements by the central administration to the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, will be reused and re -entered in new and future interventions; If this were not the case, the regional administration would find itself next year to implement those resources already assigned to local authorities to complete the works, to find further resources that will have to serve to complete the initiatives to support the functional recovery of all activities - from the road network to the technological networks touched - and will be the subject of the next financial programming and find this type of resources. This is a phase. The other phase is that of attention to the resources necessary to cover material damage. In this sense, an assessment that, in my opinion, has escaped to most, and is for what I appreciated, in some ways, the examination made by the minority colleague together with the illustration by colleague Malacrinò who promptly reported the resources intended, chapter by chapter, on this type of interventions. The 3,900,000 euros allocated in article 1, are substantially resources intended to refund the damage suffered, the material damages, by all the activities that have been involved in the alluvial management and which are, as already underlined in other circumstances, intended for law 5 (albeit perfectible, albeit dated in some ways, a little more cumbersome) that has even tried to streamline, accelerating the classic times of the classic times of the classic times of the classic times of the classic times End of the emergency, as set in a classic way, and accelerating the possibility of making requests for financing and requests for support for the damage suffered - with a procedure that provides for the definition, through the appraisals, through the necessary procedures and then go to the delivery - which will lead to a refreshment, where sufficient those resources, up to 70%. Where, on the other hand, in the face of a more important situation than these 3.9 million - and I also go to respond to some exceptions of the Forza Italia group - net of what will be the refreshments that will be assessed according to the resources made available by the state administration ... they will complete that band of attention that the regional administration must rightly have for those who have undergone important damage. On the other hand, the discourse of sharing is a speech where the intervention teacher lines on what had to be the attention to be placed to the structures, the activities, which had not had the opportunity to work, for the flood cause, in July, were available. The choice was prudent, fought and also shared and brought to the table of the associations, where there were different requests, but where it was considered (in a very transparent way, and also very serious, in my opinion) to share a path where these resources were made available for a relaunch of the activities from a point of view of liquidity. In some cases, the situations that had occurred could lead to refreshments - as we defined them - of a few thousand euros, which as a whole would not have moved the ranking of companies that perhaps have to plan the next winter activity, the next seasons and relaunch investments, and we have decided to support in an important way the possibility of self -financing, both to start again with the activity, and to create the conditions for having a functional liquidity to the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of stocks and so on. At the same time, and I fit into the article relating to the ski world cup, we believed that we must also include in this bill of the propulsive initiatives, of the initiatives that, starting from a critical situation, could give an envelope, a relaunch, to this ski resort: we did it by supporting, from a political point of view, the possibility of having the ski world cup in Cogne in January, and to support it with a Very pragmatic approach from the point of view of the use of financial resources, going to identify, as a beneficiary body of this contribution, the Municipality of Cogne, not so much to diminish the importance of a World Cup in Cogne or to make it estimated from the sports world, but precisely to make instead the need to intervene and plan a manifestation of this importance in a relatively short time, which is the one that is the one that is now in the end, of January. Other initiatives were then introduced on the sidelines of the natural disasters, which we all know well, and went to support the world of the company transversely, within which there is certainly a large part of the companies also touched by the flood, with support for the initiatives in favor of the confidi, going to implement - and it was underlined, and I thank those who did it - the goodness of this path that, in recent years, has seen a growth in the last two years, Interest rates for those who have been indebted and this reimbursement of the interests of the expenses incurred by our companies will thus be compensated almost overall compared to the law, which provides to reach up to 75% of reimbursement of the interest paid, and therefore 1,600,000 which brings to 4 and a half million euros the contribution in interest to the companies guaranteed by the confidi. And again, the possibility - as I said - to have particular attention to the territory through the consortia of land improvement in some situations that worry, from a point of view of urgency, for the areas concerned but also for the severity of those that may be the situations if you do not go to normalize and on which you do not go to intervene with a certain speed. To this, which is the universe of the initiatives that, overall, count about 55 million euros of resources made available for the flood, some cases have been added that are part, in a final part of the year, of those budget variations that are used to give the most urgent answers to the needs manifested by the structures and the territory, so that they can close those interventions that urgently shout that there has been a flood or not; Here we are talking about the chabod boarding school or the Pé-Saint-Didier swimming pool, where we can make comments and evaluations even of a wider order and on which we can or not agree, but that they need a closure of the circle and a deepening has been made, the councilor brought him to the attention of the council commission and I believe that this type of attention can then be partially exploited where I also want to do it. Punctual response to a territory that has not been served by a structure that has a very important specific weight for too long. I only within the merits, again, of an evaluation, which is that relating to the municipal secretaries. I, if I were those who have raised this request in recent months, I would find myself satisfied with the insertion of this clarification, let's call it that; It was debated from a technical point of view, the competent council commission had wanted and also audited the general secretary regarding an overall examination of the uncertainties that the secretaries agency had also shown regarding the new formulations and the situation had been clarified in some ways. I believe that this type of intervention gives greater interpretative guarantees and greater clarity - just as the opposition councilors required that over time had manifested this uncertainty - and I think it is also to be made to these stresses, to go to close a circle today. In this regard, I allow myself to anticipate what will also be the illustration, if we then want to do it in a more detailed way, of the amendment that we presented this morning and that goes, as shared in the board commission, to a principle with which we indicate a reserve, not so much to further complicate an article that has already been the subject of many variations in these weeks and in recent months, but to satisfy an intention - I seemed to have welcomed it in those terms - of the competent Commission and the competent Commission when there were two options on the plate and we had proposed, within the standard, a path that was - if we want - more respectful and relevant to those that were already ongoing national regulations, but with the idea, where shared by local authorities and by this classroom, to insert something more specific to the matured experience of the municipal secretaries in the last 5 years, and, in the case. worked more than three years within the municipalities, already acquiring a sort of familiarity in the activities to be carried out within our local authorities "". It is a path that, in my opinion, goes to clarify and also give answers about what can be the effectiveness of the secretaries (who are a focal point within our municipal administrations) and to give a 360 degree coverage of the needs to move forward with this call. I would stop here, thanking everyone for the discussion, thanking also for having to share the information, because in the sharing path that has been had in these months - net of doing it once a week, as someone said, or not - it is always very complex to be able to transmit, in a overall and complete way, every activity that is carried out in everyday life. We tried to do it in compliance with an assumed commitment, but to work for the good of the activities that were to be done, and which are still to be done now, in wanting to mean shared visions within the government, within the majority, and make them available as an information and as a reason for evaluation by the oppositions, which they wanted to show their opposition or their sharing on this type of initiative were able to do it. Today is the time to have any answers, to close a circle, and this is a proposal that seems to us very balanced, which goes to give three answers, one to those who have had damage (and there will be a certification of these, there will be a substantial coverage thanks to Law 5), one to the municipal administrations, and, indirectly, one to the companies and the communities that have been involved that will have the opportunity to work already, using the resources, using the resources. their provision to plan both the design part and that of the works that will evidently be carried out with the due times, and the activities of relaunching the activities in the area, through the World Ski World Cup but also through all those interventions dedicated to the territory with these 55 million made available mainly of the post flood but not forgetting the other things that, as I said, had to be brought more urgently than other topics."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,2834,"As we briefly summarized, already in the general discussion of the standard we have presented this agenda, because to date the much discussed article 5 provides for provisions that go to grant loans and not the refreshments and we know that this was one of the debated issues on which a choice had to be made. I believe that our vision and our will has already been highly highlighted and I have to tell her, president, that in his reply he made a passage that is a slightly cryptic passage and perhaps he will be able to clarify it, if he wants, because he said there was a discussion table with the associations and that there were different opinions. I did not understand if the discussion table with the associations, which reported different opinions, was precisely on the nature of the support that the Region had to provide to companies. This is why this agenda arrives, but above all this agenda highlights a theme that she has not dealt with - and of this I regret, and I hope that, before the end of the discussion and the vote, she will also have the opportunity to clarify it - that is, the question relating to the failure to audition the associations that we have indicated, because, objectively, it was raised a little by all the opposition colleagues, and I found it incomprehensible. She, if in her speech - I try to try to make a condensed, to extract something that can go in that direction - she veiledly wanted to say that there were actually different opinions on the nature of this support provided to companies, then you knew it and guilty you have avoided that the companies would come to tell us what they thought, because you did not want to leave the documents, in the verbal, a other, more critical. The phrase with which the request for audition was liquidated, that is ""are not relevant to the law""; This is an objectively embarrassing thing, so it is clear that it is not acceptable. However, coming to the commitment and the agenda, as we have highlighted and as we have reported, with this agenda it is asked - and even more so if you say that there is the possibility that the funds that have been covered, in advance of the potential supports and supports by the national part ... - If there is therefore a coverage of these funds, if the resources with which a measure can then be established. All the more reason, with this agenda we ask and undertake the regional government to prepare a measure, with relative financial coverage, which recognizes the adequate refreshments to companies and economic operators affected by the alluvial events of 29 and 30 June."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,6,4126,"I gladly respond to this umpteenth solicitation by colleague Manfrin, because there are topics where the colleague is very prepared, others where his interventions are a little more incomplete. First of all, I allow myself to underline how within the comparison that was there - and it seems to me that it has always participated - perhaps it is also my fault, that I have not expressed myself in the best way, but they were underlined and made available, also of the colleagues, of the assessments that derived from a comparison mainly with Adava, which was the most active interlocutor in this course during these months. The options that had been underlined and had been brought to the table, to whom she was also sitting, gave two types of opportunities: one to intervene with the refreshments, as classically understood, with a percentage of compensation around 20% compared to the failure to make inclaimed rates, which had been identified, wide, about 4 million, which would have brought it - and I mentioned it within my replica - to some in some cases they would have contributed in some case. Important way and in some cases for a few thousand euros) for many companies that had had revenues lower than 40% compared to the average of previous years. Everything still to be certified, all to put in line and all to put in a context that took into account from a part of what could be the limitations dictated by the aid of state, on the other of the actual reports and the bureaucracy that had to be developed in order to be able to reach these refunds. The evaluation that had been proposed, and was proposed at the table, to which no one then said neither yes nor no, rightly, because then it becomes easier perhaps to go to criticize a choice that must somehow be made and say: ""No, but I preferred the other"" ... Meanwhile, in the meantime we put one on the table and think of doing it in the best way to give answers, therefore we have evaluated to meet a choice that could be more coherent and more positive. suffered damage and for those who needed to relaunch their business, going to support them with an amount (in some ways even higher than the individual reimbursements would have been) which, however, could have given to all companies the opportunity to supply themselves in an appropriate way to relaunch their season, to relaunch their work over time, providing most of the resources for a renovation of the services that are part of the possibility of hosting new people, Initiatives such as the World Cup to relaunch the territory. I still want to emphasize the commitment that there was by the competent councilor in a negotiation - I call it this way - in a very close confrontation also with the competent ministry, of which we will then talk in the second of the two proposals of the agenda, where the councilor and the Piedmontese councilor evaluated to be able to insert, where possible to do so, also of the refreshments in addition to the reimbursements for the material damage suffered, because in the Piedmontese territory, They were, so we collaborated to find a path that could also give the two opportunities to our territory, and I think - net that someone is not happy and that it would perhaps have preferred something different - we did a careful job and with the desire to give the answer that we believe best for this type of interventions. We did it in concert and also comparing ourselves with the associations during the course, as we had anticipated to her too; On this aspect I think that the availability, also from Finaosta, to make available a product that can be appreciated, very slender and very quick to set up and to be activated in favor of those who need it is an important example. As for your agenda, we will abstain for the reasons we have expressed."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,8,5334,"Thank you, president, for your courteous reply, I also thank you for your judgment on my skills, I appreciate it in a particular way, I am sure that instead she, accustomed to covering all the roles a little, has developed exceptional understanding of understanding on all the themes of human knowledge and gives it daily, and we thank this for this and we thank the providence of having placed it in that position. D'Aosta, on the other hand, we certainly have a person who is of everything in the right place, at the right time, and we thank this for this. Net of this, she was very skilled to say something of this type: the choice is this because as it was conceived, that is, as you had thought of it, therefore the percentage of non -collection, the percentage of refreshment, what it entered, what was given, that is, the model that you had made you did not be fine, and since the model of refreshments that you were made. President, but it doesn't work like this, it doesn't work like this at all! There are two roads, at least we said it and she admitted it too: there is the road that you have taken of you, and we will see - we have expressed an opinion - we will see how many people will use these loans, especially since, as we have also underlined in the text, the winter season has already started and these loans still the possibility of adherence is not there, so we will see how much will be able to see you, The pull on the measure, especially for those who have been particularly in difficulty, because I put myself in the role of a structure that has had damage and clearly face you and has no liquidity to do it, take loans that will then have to return and therefore worsen its hole. This is a mode that we will check. He said, however, and I am happy, that there are two roads: there is the road to the loans you have taken, on which I also want to reiterate that it is not that we were placed in the meetings the opportunity to choose, because we said it, we were simply informed, we got there and we were said: ""We thought about this, we thought of doing this other, things are so, what are the things so, what"" do not want to take? That it is so? ""We asked for it even several times, if it will remember:"" To this proposal, to this article, there are alternatives? "" It is not the fact that I was sitting at the table and to be informed of what happened that makes us somehow complicit; We took note of it and we told him clearly, I think transparency is absolutely impeccable on our part. She said that she responded with pleasure but in reality she did not answer, or rather, she replied how she is usual, in her omniscience, that is, not saying: ""Eh, yes, we prevented the debate because we were afraid that someone came to the Commission to say: we do not want this measure, we do not want this proposal"", it would have been more honest instead of giving mandate to the president of the II Commission to dry out, it would have been more honest. ""We don't want criticism, we know everything, we have science infused, we don't want criticism."" But no, but as it usually does, she says in her answer that ""net of someone's failure to satisfy"", so one could read that someone is not satisfied, but this ""someone"" to what percentage of the sum activities? Because she talked mainly of Adava, but we have listed two other categories, Confcommercio and Confesercenti. Was these categories asked what they thought about it? Because we did it, we asked him, and these categories did not even see the text. We simply are not that we wanted to have a part of part from one part to the other, someone preferred to say: ""Do you know that there is? No, we don't make the auditions because"" it is so and it is so ""and they are not relevant to the law"". We take note, we will obviously communicate to companies and trade associations that are no longer companies, they must not be defined as so, because the article that establishes this possibility obviously does not include them. I will tell her the truth, for a moment an idea had come, that is, to present an amendment that removed the word ""businesses"" from the article, because so much is not relevant and therefore it was fine. It would have been the provocation and perhaps he would have added something to the debate, but we believe that this is in itself evident, in reality, even in his response. It is therefore evident that you have made a choice, we legitimately propose another one, then we will vote as you do in democracy and we will see the result at the end and everyone, inside and outside this classroom, will be able to know how one thinks and how the other thinks in a democratic way. It would have been more cute to also have people's ideas, but you are a bit allergic to criticism. Okay, in agreement, we will see how many you will collect from here at the end of the legislature."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,10,7267,"We also illustrate, as a group of Forza Italia, the agenda that we presented in the field of refreshments following the damage suffered by the flood of 29 and 30 June last. Basically it is a re-proposal of the agenda that we have presented in the context of the discussion of the Defr 2025-2027, in relation to the support of the economic operators who are not affected by the refreshment provided for by the State. We believe that, with a view to collaboration between the State and the Region, it is necessary to deal with the theme in the context of complementarity of action and at the supplementary level, as it is done by the Region in many situations, I refer, for example, to what we have already seen in the past in the context of the initiatives of the world of work, of training, where the state makes available to the funds on one sector and the Region makes available on the other, to give complete coverage to the needs that are in the area. In this case, the constructive collaboration relationship with the central center -right government that proven, in this circumstance and in others, to have a great consideration of our region to be highlighted. I would like to start, in the introduction, from the first inspection that was in Aosta, the meeting of 2 July, with the Minister of Tourism, where the availability of economic operators was announced, which are the responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism, of a series of aid to support refreshment: 10 million had been announced, today 15 million have been decreed together with Piedmont but I believe that the word given was maintained, with the decree that was approved on 11 November. After that there was the inspection in the valley and the great attention that was shown by the Minister of Public Administration and by the Minister of Civil Protection that came to account: the Ministry of Civil Protection made available, following the decree of the state of emergency, 20.6 million euros to cope with the difficulties. The Region did its part and I believe that with satisfaction the opening of the road was recorded after 27 days of insulation, an important job was done to which all the regional structures have made their contribution. From the point of view of the approach that was there at this change in the budget, we had said in illustration in the intervention of the general discussion, my colleague repeated it that intervened after me, that we would have shared the articles from 1 to 7 and instead, as regards the attitude on the overall vote of the provision, it would also have been in consideration of what would have been the behavior on this agenda by the regional government. We have not made any confusion, we are very clear and we believe that the Region, for our way of seeing and giving solution to this problem, should intervene to complete what the state has done, as part of the activities that are excluded from the benefits that are financed by the Ministry of the Interior, because in these days we have also seen in the press that someone says that it is a pity that the bars are not included, so it means that they were a need, because the state had made available to the state. They would have been useful for these categories, not as it is said now that perhaps there was no need, because someone may come to him1.000 euros rather than 1,500, rather than 500 euros and that it is an evaluation of an insignificant benefit. For us it is significant, so we believe that it would have been correct that all economic operators could have had the same approach by the public administration, but an supplementary approach of what the state has set up, because we cannot always think of delegating everything to the state, we also have responsibilities of management and therefore I believe that, as in a family, everyone should do his part: everyone makes available what he can put in the moment to face the situation of difficulty. I believe that the allocation we received from the state is important but if the state has provided in the context of the categories included by the Ministry of Tourism, I believe that we would have been up to us to see what the excluded categories are and intervene in the same way on that type of activity. This is what we ask with this agenda, nothing more; It seems very simple but also very reasonable as a proposal. We cannot understand the reason, the ratio for which it cannot be accepted. Among other things, it seems to me that on the question of the refreshment of indirect damages, the categories have claimed it and have requested it, therefore either the categories do not also have the clear situation of the situation, or there is something that does not square in the approach. The measure of article 5 we will support it, but it is a completely different measure, which gives a response not to the need for refreshment, gives the opportunity to open mortgages, but they are two completely distinct things. We will vote for article 5, but we ask to be able to go in this direction. To the colleagues of the opposition who said that perhaps this is the presentation of the agenda, it was also the opportunity to clarify to eliminate their confusion, in the sense of approaching this initiative; I say that perhaps it is we who have some confusion lately because we no longer know what the locations are in this classroom. We take it more and more and it would be important to understand what are the real locations from here to the budget because we will not face a partial subject like this, but we will have to manage, in a dozen or fifteen days, the budget of the Valle d'Aosta region. Our spirit is a very clear spirit, everyone knows what our location is, a location of Forza Italia Centrale in the center -right, we do not understand what the self -refinerations are geometrically placed somewhere. We believe that the Center corresponds to a non -geographical representation, but of values, so we wait for the evolutions that must be there, but we believe to send back to the sender of the observations that are purely instrumental and that also try to feed political weeds within the center -right. The center -right is a project, which is at an advanced stage because it is working together, it is nice that the League also had a maturation path because at the time of the Defr the initiative that we had presented on the refreshments had not been supported, today instead it shared this spirit, so we will no longer be only we of Forza Italia to represent this need of the Avalthian but the sharing number will grow in the classroom. For our part, the construction site is an advanced construction site, it is not a construction site still under planning or design, therefore, to those who allow themselves to make assessments within the house of others, we wish to have the same success, to be able to put together the energies and the forces that presupposes to be able to put together."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,12,2940,"I reply in this first joke, and then leave room for colleague Grosjacques as regards the most technical aspects relating to the refreshments by the state. I will reply in a very simple way. Perhaps, animated by this political positioning, some aspects have been lost on the Legislative Decree Which instead had to be analyzed in a slightly more in -depth way, as other colleagues did and tried to bring back to the classroom. The first article, which is an article that goes to finance Law 5, is an article that will guarantee the refreshments to those who have had damage in the area. The procedure of law 5, the 3,900,000 euros of resources; It seems to me that in article 1 we go to finance what will be the requests that have been made, however without the indication of an ateco code or anything else, because law 5 does not provide for this type of development. Precisely with the perspective of what she says, these resources are made available to cover companies that will not be touched by the national decree, since, only to add an element, those who adhere to the national contribution must not have other subsidies, by other bodies or other public resources, to complete. It goes alone that the answer to his question is already within the Legislative Decree, that is, those resources there - which are not enough or there are too many and that they will be remodeled, increased, evaluated in a possible future bill ... - are already present and are there on purpose to give a repayment of up to 70% for those companies that have had material damage; Those that will clearly be excluded and will not be contemplated within the national path that provides for 15 million reimbursements for the material damage suffered (therefore all those situations that will need to be reimbursed for the interventions they have had to do) will find an answer within Law 5 with this first allocation which, if it is not enough, will be implemented, but which will guarantee a reimbursement to 70%. This is the path that had already been adopted in 2000 with the flood, which gave a coverage to the damage transversely had in the area and that, even in this circumstance, with speeding up, if we want, also of the law, because the law of his - I said it before but perhaps it has escaped - should see, before being able to draw up the beneficiaries, the closure of the emergency path, which in this case is by means of the resources. made available by the State, will see the formalization of those who can access the regional benefits; They are resources already available immediately and they will be made available to those people who will not have had refers nationally. From this point of view, therefore, I feel authorized to say that the availability is already there and is already conclaimed within this bill."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,14,1214,"President, perhaps we have a misunderstanding, article 1 covers direct material damage, the decree of the Ministry of Tourism also covers the indirect damage and we are talking about this, so I don't know if we cannot understand. It's very simple, she tells us something to divert the reasoning. The discussion is only and exclusively on indirect damage that are called missed profits, because material damage is one thing and in article 1 there is no indirect damage. Then I am telling you that there is an unfair behavior on the part of the public administration in relations with economic operators, because there are economic operators who will have compensation of refreshments on direct and indirect damage and there are economic operators who, because the region does not put the money on indirect damage, will have only the recognition of direct damage. We must not be able to make fun of us, because this is the truth, because equivocal on this means making fun of itself, because the agenda, to tell him very clearly, has this objective, to recognize the indirect damage, the one that the associations that you did not want to give answers ask for.

Meanwhile, in the introduction, you will not lead us to say that the Ministry and the Government did not do their part, also because I wish to thank the structures of the Ministry for what they did and above all for the interlocutions we had, that they were continuous and constant; However, I believe that it is important to summarize some steps, because she concludes the agenda by saying that she prepares a refreshment measure to cover the atheist codes not of competence of the ministry. Then I will come, making the excursus, to tell her that those who were kept outside were not kept outside because not of competence of the Ministry, but were kept out for a choice linked to resources, as stated by the general manager. In your questions, she asks if the perimeter of the atheco codes of the decree was known. We started our interlocutions, starting from the next day of the visit of Minister Santanchè of 2 July; The minister (and this is good to underline it, even if the president has already made a passage on this) after the commitment of the 10 million - which then became 10 for two regions and then became 15 for the interlocutions between the Valle d'Aosta region and the Piedmont Region and the Minister himself - had categorically excluded the refreshments for non -profits. The decree should have concerned only the material damage only and exclusively and this emerges from a whole series of correspondences between the structures of the Department and the Ministry. The Ministry, after the video conference of 10 September, where the issues related to the contents of the decree were deepened, had sent a list of atheco codes to identify the economic activities to which ministerial resources could be destined. In this email, for example, the other sporting activities were included: on our express request we had reported some structures and infrastructures, primarily the Golf of the Breuil, which had been seriously damaged by the flood and which in the email by the ministry were first replied. We had not found the Ateco code 56.30 which concerned the bars and we have, as for other categories, written on several occasions asking to include these categories also because they had been damaged, and they are not outside the competence, because outside the competence of the Ministry of Tourism there were the commercial activities on which we did a job that did not lead to the same results, unfortunately, with the Ministry of Companies of the Made in Italy. The Ministry had, contrary to the first drafting, also a series of activities expressly requested by us, such as the rental of sports equipment, which we know that in Breuil Cervinia have suffered several huge damage, and ski schools; The decree was not subjected to us because - the explanation, I believe legitimate, of the ministry was this - since it had been sent to the Ministry of Economy and to the Court of Auditors for the visa of competence, could have undergone the findings that would subsequently give rise to changes - therefore the draft of the decree the Region never saw it, except after its definitive publication on 11 November, as she remembered. As regards the nature of the compensation, in the videoconference made on October 16 in the presence of the minister and councilor Chiarelli (my approval, for the Piedmont Region), the minister expressly asked to allow the attribution of resources for the refreshments for the non -profits, since the municipalities included in the civil protection order of the Piedmont Region would have practically had any type of refreshment as they had not occurred, situations, material damage. We therefore agreed and given our consent so that the minister could, on the basis of the agreement between the two regions, followed by the signing and subsequent publication of the decree. As regards the competence of the Ministry's subjects, evaluations were made here by saying: ""You asked for things that were not the responsibility""; It is not true, because, if she read - as I imagine that she has done - carefully the atheco codes, she found the canteens or street pastry shops or in any case the restaurants, therefore catering activities, activities that are usually managed by the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy, therefore this decree could have safely included bars. I say this because in the videoconference of 15 November, therefore last Friday, in the presence - I want to underline it - of all the entrepreneurial categories included in the decree, the general manager of the Ministry's production activities, to express demand - and I add that at the request of the Ministry the videoconference that lasted an hour and a half has been recorded, therefore through its channels it will certainly be able to obtain it - he said that the bars were excluded for a ministerial choice. So I believe that from this point of view all the work that was to be done was done. The merchants were absolutely taken into consideration, because the undersigned had more interlocations with the head of cabinet of Minister Urso, but the only measure available to the Ministry of Companies was that linked to the demolition of rates for those who wanted a measure similar to the one that was set up in the budget variation: the central mediocredit would have shot down the rates, but there was no type of refreshment provided by the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy. This is to say that we also followed those who knew that they would be excluded from this decree. I close because I no longer have time but I would like to say, colleague, that you have highlighted a whole series of steps, but it seems to me that your business, despite being national forces at national level, is a bit to chase the things that have already come out instead of having - and you have it - the possibility of interning, because I have heard of her on several occasions that she has telephone contacts with all the ministers of this government, so she said it on several occasions, I want to emphasize is that you could have been heavily intervened on this decree, instead we did everything that had to be done and feel today by national government forces that the decree is lacking and above all to be told that there are activities that have not been included ..."

Councilor, I carefully listened to his reconstruction, we are pleased that you have kept continuous relationships with the competent ministry. From what it appears to us, everything possible on the part of the Ministry has been done to be able to make the audience of the beneficiaries as wide as possible, so we appear to be a different thing compared to what you have announced, that is, that according to her, it could extend the benefit to some types that are excluded within the category of economic operators; As far as we are concerned, we believe we are satisfied with the work that has been done centrally, we recognize it, we were pleased that she also recognized it that there was a good collaboration, but it is precisely for this reason that we thought and we believe, as I said just a few, that, as part of a collaboration between bodies, between different institutional levels, when an approach is established are integrated and to make the measures complementary at our regional level.

A few pieces were probably lost when, in the discussion on the Defr, all the opposition groups recalled that it was a little agreed to wait for the articulated, then to be able to examine the articulated, and then be able to formulate their positioning. So we did, as we agreed, we waited to see what the articulated was and obviously I will not hide the surprise of having seen the articulated that should have been the emergency one loaded with a whole series of articles concerning the world universe; So in something that we expected exclusively dedicated to the flood, on the other hand, it is loaded with everything a little, but once given what was expected and once examined also and listened to the opinion of the bearers, which we had highlighted we would have had the pleasure of auditing in the commission, but there was no possible by virtue of the censorship applied by the President of the II Commission obviously of the President of the Region, therefore in the face of this censorship, Rather clear, but we had a confirmation.

I think that the debate we have heard was useful, however partial information is certainly not partial, is not at the level of the commissioner or the colleague Marquis, therefore in the spirit, as we wanted to support the agenda of the colleagues of the League, we will also vote for this agenda. However, I want to make a clarification: I know that colleague Marquis is much more iron in geometry than me, but politics is often algebra and is not geometry. What I said this morning ... indeed, I also thank the colleague Baccega for awarded me for a title that I am not worthy, but I thank him anyway, I tend to make a very simple consideration: I did not say that you had a confusion and I did not even say that the center -right has a confusion, I said that I was the confused one, because finding two orders of the day, however with a non -trivial peculiarity, because I must say the truth, The agenda of the League's colleagues keeps the shirts of any possible application open to insert those who have forgotten, she makes two steps that, in my opinion, have generated confusion. On the one hand, basically, he asks to intervene where - and, I repeat, I give reason to the commissioner Grosjacques - the Ministry, or in any case the government that you support at the Roman level, did not intervene and therefore I say to me: ""Why do not make an operation from your part of Moral Suasion to try to find not so much the theme of money but the ways to be able to intervene anyway?"", Because the choice is mainly depends on Aosta; On the other hand, I objectively expected only one agenda, since however this choice was made here, because - I connect to what colleague Manfrin said - in the previous location I remember very well that under the Defr, rightly, all the opposition forces, without the need to connect them with red, blue or green threads, had remained substantially a little through your agenda, for a reason: Of intent, and we know that the term communion is complex, because everyone has to agree, and we found ourselves a little displaced. Here therefore - it is my confusion, I repeat, you will surely have clear ideas - like a battleship you go to Dardanelli and I am happy for you, but the confusion was mine, because if I had to choose who to support, in the end I have to understand if they say the same thing, if they say two different things. Support is a support on the principle, on the will, even on the effort, but objectively, from what I felt by the councilor, the demanding is perhaps not entirely ... or in any case what happened, or rather, even some premises, perhaps it is not entirely consistent with the path, however, I repeat, we have certainly partial information, so it is you who must then give an explanation of what happened, and the ""you"" say it. I did not give confusion to others, I was the confused one, because finding these orders of the day, rightly one says: ""let me understand what the position is"", considering that à maintes reprises, as I said, is said that you are united for better or for worse, and nobody wants to divide you, for heaven's sake, already do enough alone in some things. Having said that, I repeat, in the beginning we vote for it even if, in the face of what we have heard, there are many doubts."

I also make some considerations in the light of the President's reply, because when it highlights that I agree or to have appreciated the report of the councilor aggravation ... I would like to highlight that in that report there are all the sharing points that have been expressed by all the other group leaders, therefore a lack of sharing the provision, the auditions denied in the Commission, the resources covered by national funds, the insertion of articles that had no relevance to the Secretaries, the same councilor also redone himself to the considerations that I brought during the general discussion to say that he shared what I said in full. Also this time I do not understand if it is linked to the way the various thoughts are displayed or if it is linked to the variable geometries that we feel so much about in these days. Honestly, from this point of view, as has been announced by the president, surely the document that we will vote in the next regional council will perhaps also define the picture, but I repeat that I will see what what has been said, but having also shared with his colleague his minority relationship, I can say that in some way I have shared his and he shared mine, because the things we said are the same. As I said, it is a shame, you could have a unanimous vote, most likely on those articles concerning the emergency. So we didn't want to do and therefore we will abstain."

From these interlocutions were born some observations that we had the opportunity to present to the III council commission, audited by President Charrian in III Commission on December 19, 2023 and after this hearing, we proceeded with notification no. 4 to the European Commission. This notification was then approved by the European Community with its own decision on September 30, 2024 and therefore today we find ourselves having to ratify the modification of this CSR based on the interlocutions that we have already had throughout the year. In addition, compared to the changes that we agreed and on which we compared in December with the council commission, we have a reduction of 1% of the Feasr share - established in accordance with the Ministry, to go to give a response of solidarity with respect to the alluvial events that have insisted insistently especially the agricultural sector in Emilia Romagna - and an increase in the prizes on the organic 10 euros on the meadows and 5 euros to also include certification. This was a request that the trade associations and the representatives had made: ""Including in costs also precisely the certification costs""; Through all the interlocutions, it was decided to raise the shares of these euros (precisely to give this type of response) and to go, in fact, to include certification costs."

It is the new reference of the common agricultural policy, a complex of rules in support of the agricultural and forestry sectors for rural areas, is the founding reference in Italy to the national strategic plan, shared with all regions, the resources are about 92 million for us for us, with state-region and fesr shares. It contains all forms of support, in particular those related to disadvantaged areas, to compensatory payment for the agricultural areas Natura 2000 and for animal welfare, very important and necessary for us compared to other realities of the Po Valley. With today's approval, real support for the agricultural world is implemented - certainly not of simple application, we are clearly convinced of it - but which requires a temporal application effort that needs to understand the system and changes to the management of companies, changes that are not always immediate and adaptable, but these new formulas indicate new roads for production and less impactful management, with choices aimed at organic, in particular with the productions forage. A great work was carried out by the trade association, by freelancers, the offices of the Department and the VDA area, to make companies adopt the binding changes thinking of the new agricultural production and management systems. We had a time on our side privileged environmental conditions and today, year by year, we must know how to grasp the changes and constantly model the entrepreneurial management of the climate and the trend of the market, not only local. The future hope for the sector is a conscious adhesion, already started with the knowledge of the detailed, but not impossible conditions; They are opportunities proposed as in the past, with constant and punctual payments, hoping that the Aosta Valley will always be among the first places and, if not to the first, as happened in the past, for the progress of the expenditure of regular and punctual payments, with the collection of measures, hope is for everyone by the end of the year. For companies, which have earned it, a Christmas gratification, not indifferent to the payments of rents, staff and mortgages with expiring installments. In addition, it is worth remembering once again the commitment carried out by the primary actors, Department of Department, with its structures and offices, the area and the Agea, the trade associations, the cooperative system and, finally, the individual owners of the company or entrepreneurs, ready and aware in grasping the complement opportunities today to be approved.

I hope that with this document we will meet all these requests that have been carried out by the territory. We, as a group of Rassemine Valdôtains, had, reluctantly, were abstained last March for the approval of this document, because in our opinion it did not give concrete responses especially for these small realities, for many small realities that today maintain the territory without taking into account the economic aspect, but only for pure maintenance and tradition of the territory, with the aim of having a panorama not only agricultural, but also for the tourist aspect, which gives an impression. Because, like all of us, we know, having a well -kept territory is also very important for the tourist aspect, and I don't need to underline it. What can I say? We really learn and hope with a good omen, that this document gives an answer to the territory, to small realities and so on. As we abstained with the other document, we will abstain, but we will work in a constructive way to be able to give major resources in all senses, to be able to have a document and give answers to the territory that truly go to see those small realities that today many times are forgotten, but that give a very important contribution for the maintenance of the territory, to combat fires, floods and anything else that unfortunately today are very important, they are very important, they are very important. They are basic- perhaps, with a territory like ours, when it comes to agriculture, they do not go to affect enough regarding the aspects of our territory. I hope that with Law 17 and with other measures we will intervene in favor of these to make it give more detailed and more targeted answers to all these particularities, so that they continue to maintain our territory as has always been maintained, as we have inherited it by our ancestors."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,16752,"This proposed bill deals with urgent measures to counter the depopulation of small mountain municipalities. The Aosta Valley is considered a mountain region in full; On the maps that we study at school the mountain percentage is 100%. This aspect, if we are objective, and above all grown up compared to when we went to school, we do not consider it truthful, or at least not in full. There are municipalities, or in any case parts of them, that calling them Montani is a real insult for those who really know what the mountain is and lives it all year round. We must be primarily, therefore, to stop calling ourselves entirely mountains if we want to give justice to those who really live there in the mountains. The depopulation touches almost all in the Aosta Valley, except the municipalities of the Plaine, in which instead there is a general increase in the population. But the difference, and this is the sense of the law, is that the depopulation that touches the small municipalities puts at risk the existence of the same. Losing 100 people in Châtillon is certainly serious, to miss 10 in Rhêmes-Notre-Dame is much more. It goes of social, economic life, it goes of volunteering - just think of the Pro loco, the volunteer firefighters, the Alpine troops - and they go about politics, now we always see the usual people who apply, provided that precisely these people are still located. And on this I precisely want to emphasize: Municipalities that to date no longer have a sufficient critical mass of the population to guarantee a life of the community are municipalities intended to have a future, are they intended for death, why is this that it is, and how can a young man also invest in a municipality that does not have a future? Often the mistake of looking at the increase and decrease of the population in the last ten years is made, of course, these data must be taken into account, but above all the trend must be analyzed in recent decades. Èmile Chanoux already in the 1920s said: ""Je suis originaire of a Pays de la Vallée d'Aoste Où le dépeuplection fait le plus de ravages. J'ai can see the épouvantable sadness de ce pays de vieux"". It is in fact starting from the unification of Italy that the depopulation of many of our small municipalities and many high hamlets of large municipalities has begun, the data of the various censuses demonstrate it and these are easily available on the Istat website. If we analyze this trend in recent decades, the numbers are merciless, we take some examples, in fact, starting from the unification of Italy. In 1861 Allein had 770 inhabitants, now 207; Chamis 322, now 107; Emarèse 495, now 217; Etroubles 1.032, now 478; La Magdeleine 386, now 100; Pontboset 708, now 174; Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 777, now 164; Valsavarenc 639, now 161. There are only some examples. A phenomenon, as I said, that has distant roots; Not simple solutions, but those proposed in the law could be some of these. In fact, this proposal faces one of the aspects that could reverse the phenomenon of depopulation: the fact that living in the mountains more costs and therefore contributions are needed, and above all the decision. A proposal that has never claimed to be decisive of the problem, but a proposal that must be, together with others, one of the pieces of the puzzle, a proposal that can allow those who live in the mountains to stay there and those who want to return. Someone could argue that more than facilitations for natural persons, families, it is necessary to guarantee services - and I totally agree - but guaranteeing the services must go hand in hand together with the economic aid aimed at families and to those who want to invest in these small territories. Without people, services cannot be guaranteed, without services the presence of people cannot be guaranteed. These two themes must go hand in hand. The current results of the depopulation demonstrate two aspects: either that the measures adopted to date are not sufficient or that these measures are wrong, because otherwise we would not be here to talk about a law against depopulation. At the center of this proposal there is also the cultural aspect, an urban and urbanized valley of Aosta is in fact a valley of Aosta in which autonomy no longer makes sense, because this land would become, like many other territories, without specificity; A valley of urban and urbanized Aosta is a ""Italian Aosta Valley in all"" and on this one must in any way resist, in the name of those who wanted the specificities we enjoy today. And here is the linguistic, cultural aspect, of symbiosis with the high lands to be sent back: in fact, for those who decide to return to live in the mountain municipalities, the need to attend a francoprovoral language and culture course, Titsch and Töitschu and Walser culture in the Walser municipalities, as well as a communication campaign of the measures of the law in the French states and in the German states for the communities, is expected to live to live in mountain municipalities. Walser, because the goal would be to attract new inhabitants from other states, with the aim of changing life. And, if you notice, in the financial coverage of article 4, for the contribution for the new residents, the Chéque Montagnard, the amount is absolutely prudential and in perspective, as it is really a life choice that requires time in the decision. A real, concrete, improveable proposal, as I said from the first day. A non -trivial articulated that I will now deepen. Article 1, paragraph 1, enunciates the purpose and object of this bill, recalls articles 31, 37, first paragraph, and 44, second paragraph, of the Constitution. In order to combat the demographic decline of small mountain municipalities, a measure for the birth rate and a contribution for the insertion of new residents in the small mountain municipalities is promoted, enhancing the linguistic and cultural particularism of local communities. Paragraph 2 guarantees an exemption of the regional Irpef regional area with the aim of giving support to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. Article 2, paragraph 1, defines which small mountain municipalities are, that is, those that at 31 December 2023 have a population of less than 800 inhabitants and where the seat of their town hall is above 650 meters above sea level. Paragraph 2 establishes that the regional council, within thirty days from the entry into force of the law, approves the list of municipalities that present the characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 and updates it three. Some clarifications are needed: it is quite evident that finding an objective classification is practically impossible, because there are really many aspects that define what a mountain is and what a small municipality is. The two indicators identified, however, seemed the best to include small, mountain and not purely tourist municipalities. In the initial reasoning to the law, the goal was also to understand the mountain villages of the great municipalities, which must not be absolutely of Serie B and which, in many cases, are in conditions equal to small municipalities identified by law. After a passage, however, from Dr. Ceccarelli, head of the economic and social observatory, it emerged that to date there are no disaggregated data on residents by hamlet in the hands of the Region, therefore to date it is impossible to quantify a possible burden deriving from the application of the measures of the law in parts of municipalities, but it is obvious that, in perspective, these data must be there and, if there was the law, there must be this implementation. Article 3, paragraph 1, establishes the birth allowance which Valdôtaine, as a measure aimed at promoting the increase in births and the enhancement of parenting in small mountain municipalities. Paragraph 2 highlights that the check is paid for twelve months, up to a maximum of 5 thousand euros per year in favor of the families at the time of the birth of a child and up to the completion of the third year of the child's life, or of the entry into a family of a minor, in adoption or in foster care, up to three years of age. The beneficiaries of the birth allowance are then expected to be the parents residing in a small mountain municipality of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, that is, that they transfer their residence to one of the common said and who receive a total income determined for the purposes of the income tax of natural persons up to 50 thousand euros. A sum that is certainly not trivial, but which is used to give help to the middle class, not only to the less well -off. Paragraph 4 underlines how the residence in the small mountain municipality should be maintained for at least ten years, under penalty of forfeiture of the birth allowance and the return of the sums perceived. Ten years is not a banal number at all, but it is precisely because it is necessary in the basic seriousness to undertake this type of life choices that this number has been chosen. Article 4, paragraph 1, establishes an incentive for new residents in small mountain municipalities, the Montagnard. There is an economic contribution for a three -year period of 5 thousand euros per year for the families who transfer their residence to a small mountain municipality in the region and maintain it for at least 10 years. In paragraph 2 the requirements that the members of the family unit must possess: to be Italian citizens or of a Member State of the European Union, i.e. stateless or foreigners with a regular residence permit; receive an overall income, determined for the purposes of the income tax of natural persons up to 50 thousand euros and at least two members of the family unit must be an age, at the date of demand of the contribution, less than 70 years, because in any case it would not have made sense of favoring the arrival of pensioners who certainly could give less value to the small municipalities. In paragraph 3 it is declared that, for those who already reside in the regional territory, in order to be able to transfer and have access to the contribution, the Municipality of origin must have a population of not less than 3 thousand inhabitants at 31 December 2023, because obviously one must not steal residents between small municipalities or in any case municipalities of not so large within the valley. Paragraph 4 establishes that in order to have access to the contribution, the applicant family unit must declare and demonstrate that the property located in the municipality of new residence (be it owned or deriving from a lease of loan or other equivalent title) is intended for a habitual residence for the entire period of enjoyment of the benefit. Paragraph 5 underlines that the amount of the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 has doubled if the families applicant is applied to the small mountain municipality of new residence, an entrepreneurial activity, also through the recovery of real estate of the historical artistic heritage, while Coma 6 underlines that the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 can be combined with the birth allowance referred to in Article 3. The cultural and linguistic aspect in the Local community, it is central in paragraph 7, in fact, for the purpose of achieving the contribution, all members of the family unit aged between 7 and 69 years of age, who are not affected by disabilities, pursuant to the current provisions, must attend, within the first two years of transfer of their residence to a small municipality of the mountains, a francoprovoral and francoprovoral culture course, Töitschu and Titsch of culture of culture Walser in the municipality of Issime/Eischeme and Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. In paragraph 8 it is specified that the regional council, within 60 days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, identifies the methods of organizing the course of that paragraph 7, including the entities and associations authorized to teach. On the one hand it is essential to integrate and on the other hand stimulating the population that already resides in a small municipality of the importance of one's languages ​​and cultures in a strong way. Article 5, paragraph 1, establishes that the regional council, within sixty days from the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, regulates the criteria and the method of assignment of the birth allowance with article 3 and the contribution referred to in Article 4, as well as in agreement with the CPEL, the competences regarding the relative checks. Paragraph 2 underlines how local authorities have the opportunity to integrate with their own resources the amount of the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article four, while in paragraph 3 it should be noted that the CPEL and the small mountain municipalities ensure the support activity to promote the dissemination of information regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article 4 It must promote a communication campaign regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article 4 in the States of the European Union of Francophone and Germanophones. The communicative campaign in the Germanophon states is aimed at encouraging the settlement of new Germanophon families only in the Walser Municipalities of ISSIME/EISCHEME, Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. All this is absolutely fundamental to always maintain a lively identity from a cultural point of view and above all a specificity, especially, towards the Walser municipalities. Article 6 deals with a measure designed to give help to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. A first step for a great goal, a greater possession of those who live in the mountains and which evidently have more costs that must be counterbalanced. In paragraph 1, in fact, for the tax period 2024/2025/2026, even if the measure would become structural, the subjects with overall income, determined for the purposes of the income tax of individuals, up to 50 thousand euros and which inhabit the small mountain municipalities, are exempt from the payment of the regional Irpef regional. For the first time, I believe, the theme of conventionization in some areas is systematically tackled, only in some areas, which have greater costs. A road, I think, be to follow. Article 7 inserts the evaluation clause, while article 8 defines the financial provisions. Here, I will focus on a moment on the financial provisions, because those who have deepened the law will have asked themselves for the reason for their length. Based on the data received by Dr. Nuvolari in late February 2024, relating to the money allocated but not yet engaged on the various missions and on the various programs, a thorough job was carried out to find the covers. A law concerning local authorities - someone suggested me - should have been based on the resources of current transfers to local authorities. Here, to this I totally opposed me, as local authorities do not sail in gold and because, if the law was approved, in perspective they should continue to be maintained a whole series of services or to be implemented services, therefore cutting funds from current transfers to local authorities would have been wrong. We then tried to find funds by going to touch in the least impactful way possible different missions, with the aim of preventing it from saying: ""With this law, however, the funds to health, education, public works"" and anything else are cut. I hope this effort has been appreciated, the effort not to make trivial, simplistic, resource finding reasoning, in a way to make ends meet, but an in -depth study that would allow an attempt to find the most fair funds and the least impactful possible. Then, in fact, there was the political will to go on ... the resources could very well be found in other missions and other programs. The opinion on the financial coverage of the law, given on 7 October, was negative but on the other hand, what could be expected after the law was discussed seven months after the appointment of the rapporteur that took place on 11 April? It is therefore obvious that the resources had already been spent. This was, in summary, the bill. I thank the colleagues of the League for the support, the offices that have really done an important job and also the majority councilors who, voting against this law in commission, have allowed his discussion in the classroom."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,4,4696,"I intervene on behalf of the Valdôtain Rassemblement Group. We waited with a certain curiosity the comparison in the Commission on the text of the law proposed by the colleagues of the League to understand what the positioning of the majority was and above all understand if there were evolutions regarding the proposed rule and the articulated. Why do I say this? Because we worked on the topic, so much so that we had also presented an inspection initiative and we expressed in commission of doubts that led to the abstention, the doubts about the possibility of applying this rule and above all to the opportunity to coordinate it with a state of the state law that was presented precisely by Rachampmblement Valdôtain and amended in the first commission, producing a commission text. We learned today of the absence of the amendments, perhaps in the light of how the majority was placed in the commission, which expressed a negative vote. From our point of view, this rule - which we appreciate, because we appreciate the effort and will of the colleagues of the League - could be more ambitious, much more ambitious, could foresee a connection, as we said, with the rule that provides for the establishment of the Montane Franche areas, could also in light of what the speaker said correctly and honestly ... he did not have the ambition to be decisive of the problem and faces one of the aspects, Others, produce an inversion or facilitate an inversion of depopulation. It is evident that, compared to the data that the colleague proposed to us, the depopulation in recent decades and even much more has been important, we limit ourselves to watching the trend of recent years, as he said, and this is already significant. The habits of the Aosta Valley have changed, the lifestyles, the ambitions, the way of undertaking the mountain have changed, but we have doubts compared to the definitions, the definition proposed and it is difficult to apply, ""above 650 meters, with a certain population under a certain population"", however, as has already been said, the whole Valle d'Aosta is considered mountain area. Are there any differences, but we can say that a municipality under 600 meters, which however lives an important hydrogeological instability phenomenon, a marked economic backwardness, is not worthy of taking advantage of this rule? Can we say that a municipality at 500 meters - with objective difficulties with regard to tourist flows, the promotion of the territory - is not worthy of taking advantage of this rule? It is very difficult. It is very difficult to say who can be inside, included in the norm or not, but above all what we believe is appropriate to verify and do is coordinate the new text, such as the one proposed by colleagues, with the already existing texts, with what is already being implemented on the mountain, and this is an important thing. We mainly enhance the productive aspect, how can we say that agriculture is not important in the mountains? This text does not speak of agriculture, perhaps because it is already included in other texts, but, in certain mountain areas, it is important to enhance agriculture, it is important to be ascribed as proposed by colleagues, but the standard on the Franca Montagna area that we have proposed also affects other types of taxes, affects Irap, it would be important to coordinate it with this rule. We see, in this proposal, an interesting proposal, but which must necessarily have an evolution. Our group is working on measures to be proposed, we also worked on a text to be proposed, we waited for today's discussion, we wait for the balance, we verify what can boil in the pot, we keep a high attention to this rule, on this topic, as I think the colleagues of all the political forces do, the government including. We consider a rule necessary, there are other regions that have already provided, I speak of at least six regions: Veneto, Trentino, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Piedmont and Lombardy. We believe that the Aosta Valley must produce an important text on the subject, should not leave anyone behind, but above all it should allow to highlight, to put all the particularities of our region to the attention of the regional council, which do not depend on the population density and the altitude, but must consider other problems, other peculiarities. The colleague will express himself as regards the group's vote, I leave these considerations to the Council, believing that he has given the opportunity to reason, especially in future perspective, on what you can perhaps do together."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Jordan,Corrado,1973.0,M,UV,6,4762,"In integration of what has been said, we believe that the Regional Council is needed to work on these measures, to encourage living in the mountains, to encourage our municipalities, the municipalities of the Region that can be considered, as has already been said, marginal. The demographic crisis, the depopulation and the closure of activities are all elements that involve, alas, many municipalities, therefore situations that must be addressed, as far as possible, with the tools we have available, in a strategic vision, with so -called structural policies of longer duration and not with spots or limited interventions. Fighting depopulation in small mountain municipalities necessarily requires an overall integrated approach, which therefore integrates regional policies with state policies and which considers the needs of local communities and the potential of the territory. I don't think there is a miraculous recipe to solve a trend that has multiple causes and which is objectively much more complex than it can be highlighted today in this debate. I find and find interesting the proposal presented by colleague Lavy, if only for having made available some operational proposals, proposals that, however, must return to a virtuous process of actions, including bonuses, as expected, can be useful, but cannot be considered as structural and systematic actions. Actions that, despite being complex, can certainly prove to be more effective. I believe it is necessary and appropriate that this confrontation is in -depth and integrated with the proposals that have been illustrated here in the Commission, on the occasion of the discussion on the application of the Franca zone, but still, and I add, all the initiatives that, in the institutional field, but also externally to the institutions, refer to the university, to the system of trade union organizations: all initiatives that in some way can help us to help the correct recipe must be placed in the institutional field. And I still add that it is necessary to inevitably refer to the mountain law, currently under discussion to Parliament, and to the interesting initiatives that this law could also introduce for our territory. Only in this way, only after, now it is premature, could we have a complete picture of the opportunities that could be put in place and that should, as I said before, integrate with the many actions already present in our region, we must not forget it, actions that favor small municipalities. I think of the education, the reality of subsidized schools, but still to the policies on the plants of the small ski stations, the great equalization in the federalist perspective of regional transfers that see important resources to the smaller municipalities and, again, to social policies, which beyond the difficulties that are evident, are important and if we look at the other regions we do not find so active. As a contribution to the discussion, I indicate some actions that could be the subject of an overall analysis which, in part, are already implemented and are effective, but in some cases they could be more developed. It is evident that it would be important to be able to insert tax relief for natural and legal persons, it was talked about in previous interventions - and the regional additional additional is not enough, it would be necessary to do more, but the matter is of state competence, as colleague Lavy said, and it is to be explored - or with actions related to the taxes and taxes on homes, but here there is an important financial coverage problem. We must encourage coworking spaces and the improvement of connections, Internet connectivity in marginal areas must be distributed, to encourage smart working, support the work remotely for residents or for the owners of the second houses. We must even favor the improvement of the quality of life in relation to essential services in health, with territorial structures and telemedicine, I could add. We must encourage the renovation policies of unused properties even more, as well as imagine policies for supporting the house also in these territories, or even territorial marketing campaigns, to attract new residents and new tourists, focusing on a quality of life quality of life linked to the mountain and nature. Finally, and I am aware of not having made an exhaustive analysis, indeed, collaborations between local authorities are necessary, in order to define inter -municipal services of services to share resources and develop common projects."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,8,4731,"We have already read the proposal of the colleagues of the League some time ago and we also listened to the report of colleague Lavy with interest, a report of which, also in the text accompanied by the law, we appreciated the study that was made of the situation that concerns many municipalities in our region. It is an in -depth, punctual analysis, it is noted that there is behind a job, even a serious job of deepening, and we recognize that there has been an effort from your part in presenting this proposal of the law, in which we recognize, however, some elements of weakness that arouse, also on our part, of the perplexity. The first also concerns the identification of the municipalities that are included in the list of those who would benefit from the proposed measures, and - the colleague Lavy also explained - a synthesis was found among the parameters relating to the number of inhabitants of less than 800 units and the town hall seat above 650 meters. This leads to having, in this list, municipalities that are extremely different and that can hardly be considered as regards critical issues, risks, economic situation. I make an example for everyone: the situation between Pontboset and Torgnon is certainly different, because we know very well - and also the data of the population who cited colleague Lavy say it - that it is not so much a question of inhabitants, but of development or non -development situation that brings these two realities only - I only make - to be very different. I live in one of the municipalities that would return to the list and I must say that there are some other perplexities: colleague Lavy also said that a system had to be found also as regards concrete aid, therefore the contributions, or the system of services. We believe that a bill, which really goes to intervene and help the realities of these municipalities should privilege, rather than a series of contributions, the introduction or implementation, because it is not that there are no services, but the implementation of services. Then there is also an aspect that it does not seem so easy to apply, it is that of the condition that we must respect to maintain what you have called which Valdôtain and the other relating to the birth rate, the Montagnard. The condition is said to be the residence in the municipality where this contribution was kept for ten years. Now we know that there is a dynamic of the movements of the population which is very strong; I speak of the municipality where I live, which I know well: we have very fast movements of the population, people who come, children who attend school for a period and who then move, and I do not think that the possibility of having these 5 thousand euros for the birth of the child or for the residence in the Municipality, can constitute a strong attractiveness and a motivation to remain over time on that territory. As for which Montagnard and Chèque Valdôratin, it is said that it would be necessary, for each new family unit that will decide to move to one of the small mountain municipalities, attend a francoprovoral language or culture course or Titsch or Töitschu language. I believe it is already very difficult - I think above all of the people who come from distant countries, but not only - to create the conditions for there is a possibility of daily communication, therefore of knowledge of the Italian or French language, and I think that learning our languages ​​and dialects also must be a thing linked to a will of integration that some people have. I refer to my reality, we have people who are of Romanian or Moroccan origin who speak very well the patois, but it was not an imposition, they learned it by being with the population, creating ties and also having a personal will of integration, of knowledge of the territory. A course imposed for each family unit that would be resided in these municipalities seems to us to be a little forcing. Same question for the birth allowance, which is like the other. While appreciating the effort that has been made and sharing some of the assessments that have been made, because it is certainly a problem, what we have of the depopulation of the mountain medium, we think that perhaps the reflection must be wider, more articulated and focus on a range of services that must be guaranteed to those who have voluntarily or not voluntarily decided to continue living in the mountains or coming to live in the average mountain, for which our vote will be a vote."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Chatrian,Albert,1975.0,M,UV,10,7725,"I join the thanks, colleague Lavy, for the work that has been done and allow me some reasoning on this bill, but above all on the architectural system proposed by the colleague. We must look honestly, around this classroom there is a completely different Aosta Valley compared to the numbers and passages that have also been made in relation, so we absolutely have to know our story, we absolutely have to know our potential, and there are many, but we must also have the ability to accompany the path on our legislative level: what has been done, what is being done but above all what can be done or must still be done. Certainly there is space, if today we face this theme in this way it is because regarding a whole series of measures, laws, supports, regarding identity and even culture, despite everything, we can tell us - it is not beautiful perhaps as a word - but we have kept. If we look at our neighbor Piedmont, if we look at our nearby Lombardy, their lateral valleys, I think we have been quite good, but we probably have to have that ability to find other solutions. To find other supports - however I put the economic question at the center, not the financial question - Metto the quality of life in the center. The bill is ""urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities"", whether they are small, medium or a middle ground it doesn't matter. I think that the most important challenge is to guarantee 365 days a year of the services, because then the risk - and I speak of where I live, where I know absolutely more - is that all the services are guaranteed to the high tourist lands for nine months, but that in those other three months they are practically ghost countries. The average tourist lands perhaps manage to guarantee for 12 months a whole series of public or private services, but with many difficulties, but then we have a medium mountain that perhaps - I remember the passage that the colleague made before - suffers more than the others, because it does not have those tourist potential and, therefore, has neither in season nor out of season, a whole series of services that instead the other two elements that I have highlighted have. In all this, undoubtedly, I think that the most delicate part is that linked to work-family conciliation. What is the goal to be able to create those conditions for families, new or not new, decide to live and not survive in high or medium mountains? It is being able to reconcile the work ... I open a parenthesis: in the high lands there is a lot in the two seasons, I close the parenthesis. In the intermediate lands, therefore in the media mountain, it is more delicate, but there we can work in a different way with transport and on this I open another parenthesis: it seems to me that the efforts as audience that are making themselves are truly important efforts, I highlight it knowing very well the efforts that the public is making but, despite everything, today, for a family that lives in a medium mountain, or in the high lands, and it does not have the private means, It is on site, family-work conciliation. I brought examples that we all know, but perhaps every now and then it is also important to reiterate them and highlight them. Returning to the question, I repeat, some ideas are interesting within this system, however, they must then be accompanied ... of one has already been said by other colleagues: by the law of the mountain, which we hope that you find at a mountain level, by those who at least know these territories and these needs ... and, on the other hand, by the implementation rule that can give us the opportunity to go, why not, to further regulate measures and with also innovative, even innovative instruments, I put as last, because perhaps the most important challenge on our most political level is to be able to pass that message linked to the fact that it becomes an important but different choice of life compared to the central axis of the main valley which is the one that from Pont-Saint-Martin reaches up to Courmayeur. In all this we cannot hide, I connect Lavy, she is perhaps loving as me numbers, but then, when the numbers are known, you have to find solutions to critical issues. We have a decreasing demography that is very strong, in 2012-2013-2014 the born in the Aosta Valley were about 1,300, today the born in the Aosta Valley in the last two years are about 700; It is a further element: despite all the efforts we are making as an autonomous region, these are undoubtedly raw data, but which not only have to make us reflect, but which must encourage us to find further solutions. I finish saying that on this basis, on the fact - we hope in the short term - that the law on the mountain can be approved at national level, which can be put together, however, all those measures that are now inserted in various regional laws. We will go in a few weeks to approve the 2025-2026 budget ... the dignity that this majority, and I hope that other political forces also approve those articles ... We give some certainties again to the system of local authorities; Local authorities, municipalities, which guarantee most of the services on the territories, local authorities that give those services above all, he mentioned the children, medium or a little larger medium and high mountain municipalities. Without these tools, I think that today our lateral valleys would be similar to the Piedmontese and, alas, similar to the Lombard ones. She reported very well within the relationship, making us return in 1860-1870, when Magdeleine and Chamis had inhabitants; I live in Torgnon and Magdeleine does not have 100 inhabitants, Chamis does not reach 100 inhabitants, and Torgnon and Antey together barely reach 1,000 inhabitants. To make examples. First, colleague Minelli, rightly, highlighted the difference between a Pontboset and a Torgnon, but I would not make the war of the poor and I would try to find solutions in order not to make people survive people on average or in the high mountains, but to be able, instead, to be able to guarantee that quality of life - which in the end is our role, that of creating the best laws, legislation to achieve those certain objectives - To make drastic choices, because, I assure you, putting together only the main -services, transport, school, health, sports, aggregations policies, local authorities, work and work conciliation (I have put eight) -if one stops only exclusively to the economic -financial question, if there were all the measures that as a region we put in the field, I think our valleys would be completely different. Despite this, you can probably make a further effort, a further blow of the kidneys, it would be nice to be able to do it together, this can also be an interesting starting point, intertwining proposals that are also innovative, but, if I can give advice, colleague Lavy, we put the exclusively tax, economic, financial issue a little aside, I assure you that the most important part is - according to my point of view, our quality of the point of view. Life of people who choose to remain anyway, because many, often, love the mountain, on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, but living 365 days is a choice of life."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,12,2822,"I will intervene briefly, also taking the last inspiration of his colleague Charrian. I will abstract from tax issues, the cheaper issues, because I think that this law, with the work that colleague Lavy has made, is a bit of an attempt - which I would also define original and fully in the wake of a true autonomistic spirit - to also create something new, that is, if we are here, in the end, the highest role that we can have as advisors is precisely that of legislators, therefore an attempt that I repeat, Also for this sense of novelty, of originality that is put on the table; Even pioneering as an attempt, certainly - all pioneering attempts, have their defects, that is, they will surely be able to have them, and here the colleagues who make notes on some peculiarities of the law, clearly have their reasons - but, I repeat, it is a pioneering attempt and in this way it must be evaluated. In my opinion, this bill demonstrates a considerable interest, also because, of the background, in addition to the economic and fiscal issues - on which colleagues are much more iron than me, which are a terrifying accountant from that point of view - there are other themes below: that for example of identity, which is a fundamental theme, and that in some way this law affects. If we ask ourselves today who are the Aosta Valleys, today, in 2024, how can we define the Aosta Valley in 2024, when already starting from the last century, starting from fascism, we had the first migratory waves? We think of the Venetians, then we think of the post -war period with Calabrian immigration, and today immigrations from various parts of the world. In this law, therefore, there is an attempt - in my opinion, strong and intelligent - to propose solutions that can encourage those who can and want to integrate on the Aosta Valley territory and be part of a community, a community that uses in this case the linguistic means as a system to make participation, but which is put on the table. I understand the colleague who says: ""Put it as mandatory becomes something ..."", but it is an attempt to create a cohesion, create a community, on the basis that are our identity characteristics, because the French, and perhaps even more francoproves, is something that we must not lose. In conclusion, practically everything has already been said from the colleague's report, I remitted that, with this attempt, our party shows in a certain sense a vitality and a pioneering spirit to present laws that are also new and that, albeit with some defects, certainly means, for our part, a will to look even beyond the horizons that have been used so far by those who have governed the Region in recent years."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,11486,"I thank the colleagues for the debate. I will go in order, to try to answer even the various issues that were put on the plate, because I knew very well that in the end the tones of the answers would have been, a sort of benaltrism, the need to make a global measure, the need to make reflections and is fine, we go on years, years and years to make reflections, but the phenomenon we see him, but, in fact, I go with order, starting from the words of the colleague, Some way, this text could not be related to the one on the Montane Franche areas, which we have absolutely supported, because it is something interesting, which however has a limit: temporariness, so if a franca mountaineer area is applied in a certain territory, lasts last years and then the condition remains, returns as the previous one, because the structural deficits of the territory remain. If one is half an hour of road from Aosta, it is not that with the Franca Montana area that time is reduced, it always remains half an hour on the road, it is so; It is certainly very interesting, but the Franca zone has a character of temporariness, so after all those measures end. If we wanted to have collaboration, it was possible to do it, because the text on the Montane Franche areas was promoted it seems to me in July, if I remember correctly, and this law is filed by the month of April, so there had been the will to talk to each other, this was there. I noticed, it is already under discussion of that law, which however you have taken inspiration from this law, from article 6, that on the exemption of the regional Irpef regional: you have put it a little more generally, but this does not seem to me so much collaboration but, more than anything else, and here, and here for the state proposal - it is certainly an interesting proposal - at least one article was a bit copied. On the criteria, it is obvious and I said it in the first place: the criteria are absolutely questionable, that is, who is who can define what mountains and what is a mountain? We made an attempt, but where is yours? Why is it easy to say: ""Eh, these criteria, 800 inhabitants, 650 meters, are not good, you have to find others"", and what are these others? What are they? It's easy to say, isn't it? Try to put some of them and then let's reason. The first day I arrived in the commission I said: ""If you have proposals, do them""; Zero proposals, not even one, so you don't come to say that the criteria are wrong, they are not completely convincing, they are the first to say it, but if you had a better proposal you had to do it. I have not seen proposals. Colleague Jordan said that this would be a law that has spots and limited interventions: I don't know if the text is clear, it seems to me yes, these measures are structural, therefore, if this law was approved, the measures would last over time until one wants, all the two contributions and also the additional IRPEF exemption. I inserted the three -year period because I was obliged to insert it, because it must be based on the tax period on the three -year period, but that measure would also be structural. Then I agree that the Irpef regional exemption is not enough, I agree, but in the meantime we start doing this if possible and if there is the will, since we speak so much of the mountain. For the question of the choice of life, the 10 years, the fact of the francoprovale course Titsch and Töitschu: such a measure, to bring people to live in a context like the mountain one, which is not absolutely simple, indeed, it is a serious choice of life, very serious ... so one knows that, if he decides to come and live in that territory there and access the contributions, he must remain there for ten years. If one has doubts of not staying there, it does not come out, it does not come, it does not make that choice there, it goes elsewhere, goes to the city and does not make that choice or knows where it is, if it is happy. Same thing for the language course, one knows that he has to do it, if he doesn't want to do it, enough, he doesn't come, it's not a problem. This is used to integrate those who come, but also to give us a nice wake up to us, because we are the first not to speak our patois to our children, it is a dramatic thing, and then it is obvious that everything is lost. If instead at the Valle d'Aosta it is said: ""Look, there is the one who arrived yesterday, who is doing the course of Patois, you talk it?"", ""No"", perhaps a minimum of pride motorcycles can be born and say: ""No, our languages ​​we must also be to talk to her, it is not that it must speak to her what came yesterday. Speech of the services: the speech of the services is absolutely central, but the two must go hand in hand. Compared to today in the mountain territories? We have bank branches - I will do an interpellation regarding bank desertification and so on - but how many schools did we have more? Many. If 40 years ago we had more services and today there are less, it means that the services are not the condition for which people remain at all costs in the mountains - it is a very important condition but it is not the only one - so one must act on an aspect that is often not considered here: living in the mountains costs more, we already think only at the cost of heating, so if we do not go to those who live in certain territories and have more costs, it is obvious that someone can decide. Then, always his colleague Chatrian, she said: ""If we face this theme today, it is because we kept this bad term, she said it) compared to other regions"", and they are very accorded, if we go to see in Piedmont, certain valleys are dramatically empty, there is no longer anyone or almost. Perhaps we are 20-30 years back compared to those valleys, if, in some way, to date we do not make measures that can reverse the situation, that is the goal to which you get there, because - she always said it, colleague Chatrian - demography is an exact science. Today we were born, in perspective we could have all inhabitants, without considering those who then leave, and there is another matter. Surely the theme of services is to be carried out and surely this is a text that cannot be overall, but if we want to wait an overall text, Campa Cavallo, we put two centuries to put everything inside. Let's start with a text ... Then the interesting thing, and the President of the President Testalin also said it, when he came, he said: ""Do you have doubts? On some issues, I am primarily in having doubts""; And it is there, but let's try experimentally to carry on such a law. We choose two to three municipalities, which may also have different characteristics, and we try in some way to experiment with these measures. After five years we see the results, if they are not there, I am the first to say: ""No, this is a wrong road"", but if we don't even try, we don't come to say that this is something that perhaps does not need. Let's try experimentally, then let's see, but here there is never the courage to do anything, so we sit on what we are already doing and in the meantime everything comes down. Because here, to talk about the mountains, to talk about high lands, to talk about villages, there are not many, or rather, there are some who are mostly those who still live in these territories and, if we count ourselves, those who come from more mountain municipalities, we are no longer many, indeed, we are very, but very few. Here, also in the perspective of future representation, it is obvious that in perspective who comes from the city, those who come from Plaine, have more and more a weight also electoral and representative, therefore those who come from the mountains in the classroom will be less and less, because, I see it, of my generation, of people who live there and who then deal with politics there are very few, so in perspective we risk delivering the Aosta Valley - that someone says. Mountain knows nothing. This is an important aspect, therefore, or we do something now, even with strong, experimental measures, otherwise we raise the white flag, we consider Mountain Piazza Chanoux, because someone will come to say this, now in certain parameters Aosta is considered in full mountain. For heaven's sake, some fractions yes, I am, but Aosta is not a mountain, I'm sorry. I will still reserve in the declaration of vote maybe some considerations, because we have many paradoxes. For example, we have a Deputy of the Union Valdôtaine which offers in Parliament a motion for internal areas and mountain areas. Okay, we are all capable of proposing motions, but then I would like to understand what he thinks about this bill, understand if it can be interesting or not. The fact that I noticed, because obviously it is not that once I presented the bill I was there to sleep, I shot and went to 23 municipalities, from 23 mayors, who were the protagonists of this bill. Some of these, who then amazed myself, were amazed that there was a regional councilor for the first time, a regional councilor who would go to find them - which he sincerely left me amazed - and all these mayors have still expressed great attention to this law, but really great attention, some more, who less, for heaven's sake, knowing very well that it was not decisive, but we know that the policy acts in certain systems and the CPEL. He acts, we see him: many mayors are the first to complain about depopulation, but then they do not vote for this law. Many mayors are there that complain that they have desert centers and then vote against the moratorium who would block the birth of new businesses, therefore zero consistency by many mayors. Honor, however, to those who instead with pride - because I was told that someone has not flattened, as many do - to an opinion of the cpel proposed by some mayors, in a strong way, they expressed themselves against that abstention opinion of the cpel, saying that this law could be a tool to combat the phenomenon of depopulation. Honor to these mayors who truly have courage, because we know very well that not to align in certain environments, when there are certain proposals, it is not at all simple. This was a complex bill, which touches one of the aspects of the depopulation of the mountain, which I called a puzzle; This is a piece of the puzzle, and everyone said that it is made by also interesting measures. So I tell myself: but why not try it? Because either you say a lie, saying that they are interesting measures and you do not consider them such, or fill your mouth of words and then, in the practical, when there is something different, parallel to the speech of the services and anything else, you do nothing. The doubt is that if this proposal had been made by a majority councilor, probably all these doubts, all these dietrologies, all these ""eh, but a general evaluation"", these reasoning would not have been made. This is a doubt, for heaven's sake, I know very well that it doesn't work like this. I finished, I will keep myself for the declaration of vote."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,16,5844,"The president will also intervene, I will limit myself to some observation, starting naturally from what has already been said, that is, the difficulties, what happens we all know, but fortunately we are not at the year zero, because, thanks to autonomy, our territory, even with all the limits, remains inhabited, remains alive, above all - as it has already been done - if we appear only with the nearby Piedmontese valleys: even from a political and administrative point of view, They even depend on the metropolitan area of ​​Turin and, if we had not had autonomy, it is very likely that today we would find ourselves in the same and identical situation. The theme that has been raised is interesting and the proposal is also interesting, which however has a whole series of fragility, then the reasoning of the councilor Lavy is: ""Better a little bit than nothing"". Instead, I believe that, when you have to decide a line, you have to do it completely, and I will try in this regard, in a few minutes, to make some reasoning. I am back from a meeting on the Alpine macroration in Slovenia: it is an assembly that must surely be strengthened, has weaknesses, was officially born in the early 1910s and I have allowed myself to report to the attention of colleagues in asking for greater political commitment and less technocratic vision within the alpine macro -crown, because I believe that the themes that we must face today are four more: the first is the climate change, which will change in a climate change. depth our territory; The second topic is the energy transition, also given the ambitious prospects that the same advice has given itself; The digital revolution, someone has mentioned the fact that the repopulation also passes through techniques such as coworking, and, again, the demographic crisis that, in the Aosta Valley, is actually added to the depopulation, that is, the choice that many Aosta Valley, since the post -war period, have made to go down, who in the largest municipalities of the valley floor, who instead in the city of Aosta who in the meantime has spread in what we call the Plaine. Another topic is added that is central to believing that the Aosta Valley is all mountains, which of course does not mean that then there can be there inside the classifications by area; I do not convince me the altimetry, because someone recalled that today - as Bernard Janin said, the famous geographer - those who are most in crisis are those of the medium mountain, if we use the altimetry, we will somehow also facilitate tourist resorts where well -being is quite evident. The overloads affect, what the University of Valle d'Aosta is doing is important, taking up a theme of a few years ago: to understand what the impact of school, transport, health is meaning; All expenses that weigh a lot on our regional budget and that demonstrate the peculiarity of the areas in the mountains that will have to be remarked, especially when they arrive next to it, or perhaps no longer next to the differentiated autonomy, the famous Lep. Another scenario: there is a European scenario that we must follow, because we have the same problems: the same president Kompatscher, in a dialogue also together with President Textinin, reminded us how they have a high demography but which has fallen below that percentage of the fertility rate that guarantees a replacement to the population. We are tombs from this point of view. Professor Rosina's study of the Catholic University of Milan has shown that in 2034 we will have 10 thousand Valley less in the intermediate age, that is, the most productive one. I would add, because it is very important, that the possible regional law, that in some way regulates the particularity of higher territories than the average, must take into account the law on the mountain which, with its 28 articles, has been approved by the Senate, not because we must copy - I am always for original legislation - but because this law allows a part of having a whole series of particularities that can be demonstrated in the legislation of the regions and proofs, They are interventions on the subject that are not our competence. I think it would be interesting to imagine reopening a discussion when we find ourselves in front of a complete text that, among other things, affects one of the main knots for the Italian mountain which is that of the perimeter of the mountain areas, because, if there is too much mountain (as today happens in ancient perimeters, even of the 1950s) it is very difficult to imagine specific interventions, which also apply - I remember it in conclusion - for the European Union. With the new president of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, right in Slovenia, we imagined a pact of the European mountain, starting with the Alpine mountain, because it is very clear that today in article 174 of the treaties we speak of the mountain areas, but that necessary directive that should say that the mountain is, which is different in the Massif Central rather than on the Pyrenees, rather than on the Apennines, has remained suspended, Regulation taking into account that many of the subjects that we have in article 2 of our statute of autonomy - I think of agriculture - are basically linked to decisions that are taken by European politics. It is therefore right to give the recognition of the intellectual effort, of the legal effort, to reach something, however, with all frankness, I believe that the picture is more complex and it can be said that if this was the beginning of a discussion it is good, but it cannot be considered a final phase."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,18,6328,"I believe that downstream of the latest intervention by colleague Caveri little remains to be added. I make some considerations of order more closely linked to the tissue on which this regulatory initiative wanted to enter; An already wide quite large regulatory fabric, which we have had the opportunity to share even during an inspection activity (remembered by the colleague Restano) which underlined how within the evolutionary path and attention to the mountain territory and the difficulties of living it ... because it is one thing to seek assumptions and indications to support - even continuously, assuming that it is the best way - the population that lives in the mountains that can be done at lower costs, one thing is to make it use also in step with the times ... even for so to speak ""infrastructured"" and also prodigious of opportunities, especially working and maintenance of their family in the mountains with adequate services; These are two slightly different concepts and the main aspect is to go and observe how a whole series of initiatives that we had already shared at that location have tried over time to enhance the characteristics of our mountain, with safety on roads and with the infrastructure, which has now started in the 90s, of the dorsal that should have brought the optical fiber - and brought it, up to our highest villages. Still yesterday, in an interesting meeting developed in the context of the colleague Caveri department, with Infratel, opportunities that can actually create new potential for those who want to move to the mountains have actually been drawn. This is a job that daily is accompanied by specific laws to try to enhance the job offers of our territory. His colleague Jordan mentioned it, also taking up a track that we had already presented a few weeks ago: from supporting the ski stations to mountain schools, the concessions on transport, a particular attention also to the sizing and practicability of the same, the initiatives on neighborhood exercises - to talk about situations that are developed within the regional council - but, still, in the broader area, among the opportunities that can be made available to the mountain, the resources are available. Europeans who, primarily, through the rural development plan and the activities related to the agricultural world, have tried to enhance a whole series of historical and traditional activities that maintained on our territory of the settlement opportunities even in the small municipalities and especially in the small municipalities where a company rightly, one, two, five people, a family make the difference, in spite of what may perhaps happen in the valley floor. A situation that is also very articulated at national level, I remember that in the years 2015-2016, when there were the first support activities of the marginal areas, paradoxically the case occurred where, for example, Cogne, which is a tourist station of primary importance for our region, was included in the marginal areas when - now I would not like to make mistakes - Avise or Saint -Nicolas, which had slightly different altimetric characteristics. Not such an important drop in population percentage as Cogne was not included. Two paradoxes that, if we go to see the two locations, give you a mountain feeling that is not exactly the same. This is to reach the fact that there is a network, a series of initiatives and activities that continue to be developed, such as the investments that are perorate on our territory also at the level of ski lifts, but also all those activities that try to bring security even for those who live in the mountains: we have already mentioned it a couple of times, but I will never tire of saying it: the helicopter rescue rather than the enhancements of those ski-high activities linked to the world of the world of the world of the world Randonnée, who can and must also bring young people - just like you said - on our territory. This must be accompanied by - rightly said who preceded me - of the most structured, more structural indications, which certainly pass by the law of the mountain, which has been questioned, which gives a guideline on which a regional mechanism of in -depth and adaptation can also be grafted to the characteristics and peculiarities of our territory; On the other hand, a law on the Franca area that has as its objective not so much stabilizing in time and years, over the decades, support and a contribution, but creating the conditions to relaunch above all an activity in our marginal areas, which is conclaimed and that it is guaranteed, to which it will probably have to contribute, in an important way, the region with its resources, because we say that the feeling is rather what must be cleared the principle of being able to identify independently, On which we want to go and intervene, because evidently - she teaches me - Courmayeur rather than Valtournenche, perhaps they need Rhêmes -Saint -Georges less than Lillianes, Gaby or Champorcher, of initiatives that can be developed on their territory with an important help, limited perhaps over time but that can allow you to activate in these territories of the initiatives that can then give legs to a circle. virtuoso that can report interest in our territory. This is what we had already said in the Commission, net of other technicalities relating to what is the coverage, not the coverage. However, not, not for respectability, the fact of recognizing the initiative of its transversal sharing, which has also been shown by the colleagues who intervened; I also appreciated the fact that he underlined the negative vote that allowed to bring to the classroom and discuss this proposal of the law and I believe that the interest is transversal, as has been underlined, and that there will still be time and way of working carefully especially on those two elements that can really make the difference in this context."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,20,3096,"I thank the present and the proposals of this bill, the 138 of the League. The bill 138 represents an attempt to face one of the most pressing challenges of the mountain communities, which is that of depopulation. The Aosta Valley, like many other mountain regions, is experiencing a progressive exodus of the population of the smallest centers towards the cities; This phenomenon has significant repercussions on the local economy, on the culture and enhancement of our territories. The proposal aims to reverse this trend through a series of concrete measures, focused mainly on economic incentives, therefore the birth allowance or which is a economic contribution to families who choose to have children in the small mountain municipalities, incentives for new residents, the Montagnard, tax breaks and contributions for those who ask or decide to settle in these territories and the enhancement of the territory through the promotion of local culture, therefore supporting local culture. To traditions and minority languages, the development of sustainable tourism, investments and tourist activities that respect the environment and the guarantee of basic services such as health, school and transport, we talked about it before. From a first analysis, the League's proposal presents several strengths, a concrete approach, therefore the proposed measures are specific and targeted to solve problems, attention to families, therefore: incentives for birthday, families with children and a valorisation of the territory. In our opinion, although the proposal represents a step forward in the direction of a regional policy more attentive to the needs of the mountain municipalities, some problems emerge; One of these is economic sustainability: putting these measures into practice requires significant economic resources and long -term effectiveness. Economic incentives can be a first step, but a more structural approach is needed to guarantee long -term sustainability of the mountain municipalities; The collaboration with local authorities: the success of these measures also depends on the collaboration with the Municipalities, colleague Charrian well recalled. To reach a conclusion, the proposal of law 138 of the League represents an important contribution to the debate on the enhancement of mountain areas, raising a theme of great importance and future for our region, however it is important to underline that the problem linked to the phenomenon of depopulation cannot be solved only with economic incentives, we have said several times and reiterated that a series of long -term territorial development actions are necessary, which take into account all the actors involved at the end of the end. to achieve concrete and lasting results. Starting from the assumption that this bill could also be amended in order to improve it and make it more suitable for the needs of our community, we as a group appreciate its work and for this reason we will vote for it."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,22,4170,"Thanks, president, for the latest considerations that emerged after the government's reply. I don't know if the commissioner Caveri really read ""Tradition et Renouveau"" by Janin because otherwise I don't know, some reasoning perhaps would not have made them ... (interruption outside the microphone by the commissioner Caveri.) ... It is not absolutely offensive, we would miss more. The speech of the altimetry, for heaven's sake, is questionable, but maybe I would invite you one day, indeed, to live some time, to go to Perloz Marine: I would like to see if that is not a mountain. It is not high mountains, for heaven's sake, but it is a mountain. Then the question of climate change is fine, it is obvious that we are faced with epochal challenges, as there have always been throughout history, for heaven's sake, today we have new ones and therefore we must rightly adapt. The theme of the overloads, which she pulled out - if she first offended, now gives her act that she has brought out a theme that is essential - the theme of the overloads is central, I said it: living in the mountains costs more, and this is why I believe that there is a need for economic help, on the one hand with contributions, on the other with a possession, things that are proposed by this law, therefore, for charity, do not understand the way? Okay, but, as I said before, where is your proposal? The speech of the demography, which was also touched by colleague Chatrian: ""Eh, but this law speaks of a birth check"", more demography than that ... so you can say everything, but not that this law does not touch the discourse of demography. Then the President of Testalin as usual a little flies ... but the thing I reflect on - and on the notes I had the answer that she had given to the colleague remain, when I had mentioned law 17 and various laws - is that it does not seem to me that in these laws there is an ad hoc part for the mountain territory. There are laws that apply to all the territories, therefore, if we take 17, those who have a farm from the valley floor who has a farm at 1,500 meters are benefit from it. It is obvious that it is a law that also helps those who live in the mountains, it is not a law that is only made for those who live in the mountains and that compensate for the overloads of those who live in the mountains; This is the speech. Our laws are not diversified, they are the same for everyone, on the one hand it is fine, on the other side you have to, I think, also make reflections, but then it is not that with those laws only those who live in the mountains are helping. I really, to conclude, because I understood that there is not so much, I really would like you to go for a ride in many villages of our municipalities, around the valley, all the municipalities have villages that are now abandoned, or almost, and there you will understand the roots of the depopulation, truly. Go to the valleys to talk to those who stay and that he will explain that his son has decided to leave, perhaps not even abroad, has fallen. You will understand from these people the reason why people go away: the overloads - she said, councilor Caveri - and those villages there, if it's okay, will become second houses, if it goes badly, they will be diluted. It is this policy of saying ""we are already doing"" that killing those villages, who kills programming. Let's face it for once, it is not possible to say ""we are already doing, everything is fine"", look at the Piedmont valleys, we see them all the valleys of Piedmont, but if we continue like this, we also get to the Piedmont Valleys. Let's question ourselves, we carry on measures that can also be experimental, the free zone speech is absolutely positive but that's not enough, it is not enough! Do you know when we will no longer talk about depopulation? When the last elderly of the last village is missing, then there will no longer be the problem of depopulation, because there will be no more anyone who lives in the Aosta Valley. The fact that there has not been the will to think concretely on a law and that this law has favorable, interesting principles, but that are not enough, is a truly stabbing to those who live in the mountains."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,24,2155,"Obviously I will vote positively for this law. If before I highlighted the side of the autonomistic spirit that distinguishes this proposal of the law, on the other I simply want to emphasize, as I said before, beyond the economic factor, an element that strongly characterizes our political force, that is, the League, because this is, from another point of view, the attempt to attract on our territory, in particular on that of the mountains, an immigration that can be chosen, an immigration that can be of the sustainable type of those They demand or think that anyone can arrive in our territory, even when they have attitudes or cultures or mentality that hardly integrate with our millennial culture. I repeat, a law perfectly in the wake of our party that sees and thinks that those who can come to our territory and feel and become fully Valley in full must be people who have the tools to integrate; In this case it would be the regional body that provided tools from a linguistic point of view, which is fundamental. From this point of view, therefore, I believe that it is a bill that is a real shame that it remains there, but I think it will remain, in any case, in the archives and one day, when perhaps the historians will look back and listen to the debates of this advice, they will be able to see who had at least the courage to propose something, even on an experimental title, because the colleague said it very well: even on an experimental title, rather than we can adapt to the dynamics Without making the effort, perhaps even wrong, perhaps that does not work, but an effort that represents a novelty towards phenomena of great importance and that unfortunately we cannot govern. I believe that this is a real shame, but, I repeat, those who proposed something new and had the courage to do it will remain in the annals, while, instead, on the other hand, those who perhaps did criticism, had good intentions, then on the table, however, he never put something innovative."

As standard B, and also thinking that some immigrants, for example, could be advantaged: all those who come from the French -speaking countries, probably and rightly, would have a benefit, so I think this is an element to be evaluated. However, it is difficult to answer the question I ask: ""If economic aid can affect the life choices of the family and in particular of our children"". I believe that other values ​​are, for example the love of the mountain, of culture, of traditions, which are not monetizable, even at the cost of sacrifices, then tomorrow everything changes everything.

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8009,"The next introduction of fifth generation mobile telephony technology, below, obviously we will call 5G, will give rise to new population exposure scenarios to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, which will be put in frequency calls, 694-790 MHz, 3.6-3.8 Ghz and 26.5-27.5 GHz, different from those used currently for mobile telephony, from 800 mHz to 2.6 ghz. Particular novelty of the 5G consists in the fact that it will not be aimed only at communication between people, but also to the so-called internet of things, in which the various wireless devices communicate directly to each other, using in particular electromagnetic waves belonging to the band 26.5-27.5 GHz, often indicated as millimeter waves, even if the latter correspond more precisely to the frequencies between 30 and 300 ghz, a wavelength between 1 and 10 mm .. electromagnetic waves of such high frequency, during their propagation, are unable to penetrate through the buildings or in any case to overcome obstacles and are also easily absorbed by the rain and leaves. For this reason, it will be necessary to use, to the extent of the current mobile telephony technologies, the so -called Small Cells, areas of territory covered by the radio frequency signal whose dimensions, which can go from about ten indoor meters to a few hundred outdoor meters, are much lower than those of the macro cells, which can also be extended to several kilometers. This will involve the installation of numerous antennas and this proliferation of antennas is one of the main causes of concern about the population about possible health risks connected to the electromagnetic emissions of 5G. Following the evaluation of the 2013 IARC, which had defined electromagnetic fields with radio frequencies as possible carcinogenic for the effects on head tumors related to the prolonged use of the mobile phone, numerous studies were conducted that investigated the associations between long -term exposure to electromagnetic fields and various health problems, oncological and non -oncological. The exhibitions deriving not from the use of the mobile phone but from other sources, such as the SRB radio base stations, are different in nature, above all because the possible effects are not limited to the head and, as it appears by monitoring studies, are of less intensity. To date, studies on the health effects of exhibitions at radio basic sections provide contrasting results. Moreover, due to the issuing limits, 62% of the existing sites in urban areas would be not updated to 5G and extra costs, to create the covers, would amount to approximately 1.3 billion euros per operator. To keep the 6 volts per meter, an expense of around 4 billion euros per year is estimated, a decidedly high cost for telephony companies. It should also be emphasized that 5G emissions combine with other forms of electromagnetic emissions, all with the consequences that these emissions may have both on health and on the environment. A group of Swedish researchers published the first study in the world that documents the immediate effects on human health of 5G radiation, these are groups of people who, between 2023 and 2024, began to feel bad immediately after the installation of the new 5G antennas near their homes, precisely at a distance between 3 and 538 meters. In some cases the symptoms would have been so serious as to force people to move elsewhere. The research was conducted by the Onnnart Hardell oncologist of the Swedish Foundation for the Environment and Cancer Research, known for epidemiological studies on tumors between mobile users, in collaboration with Mona Nilsson of the Swedish Foundation for the protection of radiation. The researchers measured the electromagnetic field in the homes of those who complained of health problems related to 5G and documented that 5G involves a significant increase in radiofrequency radiation pulsed compared to previous generations of mobile telephony. The people under the studio lived for years close to mobile telephony repeaters, but had never complained disorders with the reactions of 2G, 3G and 4G, but began to feel bad within 24 hours following the activation of 5G. The Swedish study is particularly innovative, because it documents the effects on the health of the radiation of 5G in the real conditions of use, while to date there were only studies on the biological effects of the different frequencies of 5G. The biological effects of radiation are not only linked to the power density, which gives information on its intensity and is responsible for heating, but are also determined by the quality of the radiation, or by its pulsation, polarization and remodeling. The most common symptoms that were found precisely in the people in question were sleep disorders, tiredness, headache, irritability, concentration problems, compromise of short -term memory and skin problems. These are the same symptoms described more than 50 years ago as microwave syndrome or radio frequency disease. In all the observed cases, the radiation levels were lower than the levels considered safe by international standards; In fact, these protect only from the effects of immediate heating of radiation, or from thermal effects, and not from the other biological effects that are due to the interference of the external electromagnetic field with that of living systems, and therefore non -thermal effects. In confirmation of the role of the radiation of 5G there is also the observation that the irradiated subjects, once transferred to another house with lower radiation levels, were better; The symptoms mitigated and in most cases they disappeared completely after a short period. In Italy the exhibition limits are measured on an average of 24 hours and not 6 minutes, as happens all over the world. The 6 -minute interval is the biological time necessary for cells to dissipate the heat produced by the radiation of radio frequency through blood circulation. It is therefore a time necessary to protect cells from the effects of heating produced by the electromagnetic field. This choice was made in 2012 by the Monti government which brought the average of measurement of the radiation from radio frequency from 6 minutes to 24 hours, with the aim of diluting the measured values ​​and in fact increase the limits of radiation radiation. It is therefore clear that, with the growing use of these technologies, studies conducted by third parties are necessary with respect to the regional administration, in the name of transparency and full accessibility of information to the community, in order to guarantee the population clear information, especially in the event of the installation of new antennas near schools, hospitals and residential areas. Moreover, the European Council itself, by recommendation of 12 July 1999, in act 519 EC, provided for in point 6 that the Member States should promote research programs in order to improve the knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendations and efforts of community and international research. With this motion, we therefore ask the regional government to activate, through a funding to be explicitly predicted for this purpose, a study system and overall impact system on human and environmental health system of the entire infrastructure system, networks and their emissions that will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G networks infrastructures, in order to guarantee and protect the health of the Avalthians."

The diffusion of ultralarga band throughout the national territory, both with fiber and with 5G, where an alternative is not possible, can serve to fill a gap, that of the digital divide which is undoubtedly a gap in our territory. But this must happen, in our opinion - or rather, had to take place - without changes to the limits of exposure and precautionary attention to risks or potential health risks which, with the increase, can obviously manifest themselves. Currently the limit was set at 15 volts per meter, by the competition decree in 2023, and previously it was 6 volts per meter, so we are talking about a more than doubled, and it is a limit that generated not a few controversies, because there is no valid reason to raise the attention value for the electromagnetic fields generated by the high frequencies, if not the economic one, of course of the telecommunications managers, who intend to save on costs of their infrastructure. It is a threshold that has been taken without a real scientific foundation and there are strong concerns that have been manifested by many parts, really many; I quote only one, because it is the one that, among the many I have read, seemed even more convincing to me and which is that of Dr. Belpoggi who has long been a scientific director of the Ramazzini Institute of Bologna who, as we know, is an institution that deals with cancer prevention. He is currently scientific manager of ISDE, the Association of Doctors for the Environment. Dr. Belpoggi, in a recent publication, said: ""The power density will change, that is, the energy absorbed by our body, which will increase by six times so much. Today Italy has wanted to align with other European countries, raising its limit, but then because it has not also aligned itself in measurement times? It is true that the limit considered safe is 61 volts per meter, so we are at 15, We should theoretically rest assured, but the fact is that in other European states, which also have limits higher than the Italian one, these values ​​have been measured on the maximum peaks. So what happens? That the data, in some way, are false. From this thing it is clear that our body, or of those who expose themselves to these peaks, has a higher frequency, on this I believe it does not rain. That of electromagnetic waves, at the moment, remains a topic that is still, in our opinion, too little investigated. In -depth analyzes have been made, but we believe they are not - on a general level, I mean - enough, because being exposed 24 hours a day, especially for some categories of people, I think of children, the elderly, the pregnant women, can be dangerous; I use the ""can"" because we do not have very certain data, but it is something that a whole series of scientists tells us, and then why not replace, for example, the large antennas - which have a concentration - with a series of smaller antennas also to dilute this exposure? You could keep the 6 volts that we had until before changing the situation, but to keep them what was needed? A very high expense was needed, which was estimated between 3 and 4 billion per year, a cost that operators do not want to support. So the commitment of this motion is welcome, which basically what does it ask? He asks for an in -depth analysis and monitoring of the impact on health. We believe that it is correct that an activity of this type is activated, also in our region, precisely because this impact of 5G technology is considered controversially by one and by the other, but having an in -depth analysis can still help clarify. We will therefore vote for the motion."

Even in the municipality of Gignod, we had evaluated two different situations, one that crossed the municipalities from Charvensod to Aymavilles and the other which concerned the antenna that will have to be positioned in the municipality of Gignod; In that motion we really asked for an in -depth analysis, identifying the subject who could give us important information in harp compared to a study that must, in our opinion, be done. The commitment therefore that the motion sets to the attention of the Council, or to make an in -depth analysis of the health of the entire infrastructure system and networks and their emissions, which will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G networks infrastructures, is certainly in line with what is our thoughts. It is certainly a matter of deepening and it is above all of giving a minimum of security also to the populations that somehow are close to these plants and which are sometimes urged by information that can also be misleading. That science gives us concrete answers compared to these paths. We will vote with conviction this motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,8,11501,"I appreciated the interventions of the councilors Manfrin and Minelli, a sign that they have carefully prepared on this complicated theme, and it would be the case that many councilors here in this classroom took care of it at least a little. I also thank Baccega for the intervention. I supported this motion - it could not be otherwise - and doing it I particularly turn to the majority of the Council, which is so sensitive to the themes of health and the ecosystem, so resilient to fight their battle in the name of a clearer and healthier environment; In particular, the family fathers who are responsible for the tomorrow of future generations for tomorrow. I wanted to tell you that electromagnetic fields represent one of the most popular environmental pollutants, rapidly increasing in the environment, and that they are capable of biological modifications on cells and living organisms, including men. The magnetic fields are natural, as we know, control all the vital processes of living beings, therefore molecular movements, cellular oscillations, ionic interactions. The electromagnetic fields are produced by nature, and I speak of cosmic rays, light energy, geomagnetism of the earth and living beings themselves. The fact is that until 1940 the natural cleaning fund was 0,0002 volt/meter, but in the last century there was a huge entry of low and high frequency artificial fields, therefore radio antennas, phones, electric cables, lamps, appliances, electrodes, etc., etc. high frequency, at low frequency, with low frequency but high intensity, the subject is very complex, the topic is very complex. The level of radio frequency radiation since 1940, indeed, let it shorter, from 1985 to 2005, in 20 years, the level of radio frequency radiation in industrialized countries has increased by 5 thousand times, therefore 5 thousand times in several radiation than the human being, like all living beings, receives. Will he do well? The 5G system was born in the last century in the US from a search by the military industry for the guidance of tanks, drones, missiles, 3D images views, it works with broad -frequency waves issuing elements, in the 700 MHz and 27 Ghz bands, but you will soon reach 86 GHz, impressive things, with Phased Array antennas, which are the phase terraced vectors, I am not doing it more difficult, but there is no more difficult one, That we would have to deepen the fixed geometry of the currently existing 3G networks, while the 5G network requires a different geometry. All this to say that we are installing a 5G on the fixed geometry of the 3G, this is naturally underutilized, but these are topics that we hope to deal with the technicians. In all this, the 5G will operate with much higher frequencies than those used so far and will add up to the fields of the current 2G, 3G and 4G, making it difficult to measure the electromagnetic field by the harp. The installation of numerous micro repeaters in urban areas will be necessary: ​​250 squares for square mile is calculated, which corresponds to an antenna every 100 m², remember, there will be an antenna for every 100 m². Today's news: in Milan a thousand lampposts will see the installation of Small Cell, of which colleague Manfrin spoke, installed on the poles of public lighting, will take care of the A2A. What happens? That the small cells on the lampposts will be at the beginning of a process that will lead to the network, naturally more powerful, more widespread to improve the connection, but the residents are already collecting signatures, because this is the first step towards a Smart City model, of course this to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. But what happens elsewhere? In Arezzo on October 8, 2024, so I speak of just over a month ago, the Municipality has made up the The Municipality of Arezzo proceeded to the drafting of an office cancellation measure in self -protection regarding the installation of the new radio base station for cell phone. The act was consequently entrusted to the technical opinion which highlighted the prevalence of the protection of public health on the provision of mobile telephony services, however the area was already covered. ""The antenna must be dismantled"", these are the words of the Municipality, the lack of indifference and urgency have been highlighted, as conditions for the release of the authorization and the unavailability of the company to identify a different solution has forced them precisely to this decision. It is therefore determined to proceed with the office cancellation of the previously granted authorization act and, consequently, to arrange the restoration of the state of the places. The antenna was taken and taken away. Later the example of the mayor of Cassano Ionio, it is good to remember it: he issued an ordinance with which he asked the stop to the works, waiting for all the checks to ensure the protection of the health of the population were carried out. In Tuscany, you will know it well, on September 22, therefore not even two months ago, the regional council resolution, signed by the Councilor for the environment and the councilor for health, I repeat: the councilor for the environment and the councilor for regional health, certainly more attentive to the health of their fellow citizens of other mountain realities that we know well, have allocated a figure of 222 thousand euros to conduct what is perhaps the first scientific research at a public level, at least in Italy. Tuscany has decided on a 5G study, six capital cities of about 100 thousand inhabitants, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Florence and Arezzo, indeed, some more than 100 thousand, will try to understand which link is among the tumors accused by the population, especially childish, and the electromagnetic fields generated by the radio base stations that are rising a little everywhere in Tuscany. So far the scientific community, as the colleagues who preceded me claimed, has only investigated the aspect of electromagnetic fields, that is, the thermal aspect. The aspect on biological tissues is very different. There will be the two regional agencies that are involved. ARPA Toscana is in charge of measuring exposure to supervelceal broadband pollution; Among its duties: analyze the limits and the development scenarios of the 5G network; elaborate a mathematical model that allows the forecast on an urban scale of the exposure levels present in the capitals; measure the exposure with the control units already supplied and buy others; carry out checks on existing 5G systems, possibly of different managers, and on those under construction that are installing; Apply to special broadbands for broadband dosimeters to measure exposure and evaluate the exposure levels where this is higher and where the population density is greater, in particular in the areas where there are schools, with the presence of children. At the Ars, on the other hand, the regional health agency will be up to: the monitoring of health and epidemiological surveillance on the cities where there are a little higher electromagnetic field levels, the estimates can also be perfected within homes and schools; Make an estimate of the possible associations between exposure to electromagnetic fields and diseases. ""On the basis of the scarce scientific literature available"", says Ars, ""it is expected to focus attention on the childish population, as more susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic pollution"". What happens to children? It happens that the CEMs, that is, electromagnetic fields, have no problems crossing the human body, the images obtained from the radiological equipment with magnetic resonance imaging, which show the entrance of the field in the human cranial box to contact, for example, of a mobile phone, demonstrate this. This dynamic is the basis of the pathogenesis of the acoustic nerve tumors and the areas of the brain tissue exposed to the side of contact with the mobile phone. The impressive thing is that in adults, the penetration is a few centimeters, while in a child it almost completely crosses the brain, of course having a more fragile, lighter base. Dr. Gandus, who was in connection a short time ago with Aosta, on the occasion of an evening dedicated to the topic, argued that the increase in childbilled brain tumors is being found in the 2000s and probably one of the causes could be the electromagnetic waves. The studies - have been mentioned by his colleague - are infinite, there are more than 10 thousand studies, and we mention the International Agency for Cancer Research, the study of Prof.hardell, the National Toxicology Program, the Ramazzini Institute has also been mentioned, etc. etc., but we also have the judicial in court: the Tar of Lazio in 2019 and the Monza in March 2019 electromagnetics and cancer beyond any reasonable doubt. What happens here in Valle d'Aosta, on the other hand? Twice, the Councilor for the Environment replied that the data correspond to how much literature and recent studies have documented, but the problem is that there is this institute that carried out these detections, the ICNIRP, International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection, and has established the not worrying level 61 volt/metro, and is the measure adopted at European level. The problem is that this institute is considered an authority only by the European Commission, which has conferred the assignment to this small private association of Bavaria to draw up the guidelines for the limitation on exposure. The assignment was assigned in 1997 and in 1998 these measures have already been issued, that is 61 volt/metro, but the studies - I have spoken of more than 10 thousand studies worldwide - support a very different thing, namely that already at 0.2 volts/metro there is an interaction with the human fabric, so there is certainly a lot to do, there is a lot to be deepened. The drift is that, in addition to this disaster on the mainland, the 5G project will also come from space. There is a launch in an orbit of at least 20 thousand satellites that will cover the earth with adjustable bands from the stratosphere, each will emit 5 million watts on the ground that will connect to the billions of objects of the internet of things, we are talking about cars, televisions, computers and tablets, it is estimated that already in 2020 there were over 20 billion these connected objects, making the environment where we live a real microwave oven 24 hours a day 24 hours a day, Without escape, without the possibility of turning it off or hiding somewhere else. Welcome therefore, we hope in a little, a little - does not demand so much - of common sense by this government, welcome an in -depth analysis: I must admit that the president of the III Commission, which I asked for the possibility of obtaining auditions from the scientific world in this classroom, has been activated and shortly we should agree with these meetings. The request is that the scientific world is listened to and not only the highly respectable Arpa technicians, for whom we have all the necessary respect, but here we have scientists who have dedicated the whole life to these research. We have scientists, we have doctors, who daily compare with this problem. I would really like to understand what the impediment can be to seriously deepen this issue."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,10,4011,"This time it's up to me because we talk about pylons, as well as talking about 5G technology. I have heard the well -known theories of those who are against 5G exposed, it is an interesting, anti -modernist movement, which connects to other anti -modernist theories. I remember what he said that those who made the vaccine would have died, now, making the horns, I would not want to die at the end of my intervention, but it is completely evident that there are contradictions that I would like to say immediately. I understand the position of the director Lucianaz, who has always fought, and must also be acknowledged with the technical competence that would envy the degree in the physics of his colleague Lavevaz, but I find that there is a contradiction in the colleagues of the League and in the colleagues of Forza Italia, because it was your governments, and in particular the Meloni government, to increase the electromagnetism rate - he recalled it with the date of 2023 - Collega Minelli. How is your government that has been reminded of a legislative decree that would have given some chances to the municipalities at least to move those pylons that will also be put in the Aosta Valley. I must only correct the councilor Minelli: 5G are small plants, technology is very different. There will be smaller pylons than the large pylons we have today. Then it is difficult today, Director Manfrin, to feel that the Aosta Valley League - I imagine in a logic of federalism, that I appreciate - say of things contrary to what the government says. The government has, in fact, liberalized the positioning of the pylons, today no one can do anything, neither the Region nor the municipal regulatory plans, and we will see how the question of Arezzo will end, because it is in the hands of administrative justice with the latest regulations that on the one hand have increased the limits of the electromagnetic fields in Italy, which remain - I also say this to the councilor Minelli - lower than those of the European average, but above all with the conversion Law Decree, there is this provision: in order to allow the timely achievement of digital transformation objectives for the interventions of the Italia 5G Plan of the realization of new network infrastructures suitable practically nothing can be done. We do not have the municipalities that today say: ""In place to put the trellis there, we put it there"", have no faculty. This was a political clarity. I repeat, who is against 5G, do so legitimately, amazes me that those who today with the law of the state has favored a massive movement of these pylons, today in this classroom the opposite. Then, for heaven's sake, I repeat, I imagine that there is a locality respect and I would not like it to be just a crush the eye to those who are against 5G. Because there is no need to do a specific study, this I do not say this, I obviously deepened with the technicians of the department, but above all with the harp, which is the one that measures must make, which must correspond to those limits that, as I said before, have increased. According to the harp is useless, because she is part of an Italian harp system that continues to have a constant exchange of information with respect to the scientific research that is done and as you know there is also a central body called Ispra, also in connection with all the institutes that are doing the research and that largely deny some things you have said today, because they are still the official results that regulate the national legislation and As autonomy, a possibility of changing technical standards that even have a European value. According to the harp, it is more than enough to be part of this system, they would today be specific studies in the Aosta Valley and money thrown away, because all the institutes of which it is part, with very large collaborations, our harp, are doing it with great effectiveness, so we will abstain."

She tells me that nothing can be done anymore, we take note of it, but in our opinion an in -depth analysis of the populations that have the superpénix that passes on the roof ... something will have to be seen and do because, in my opinion, there will be some problems. We will do some insights too.

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,6464,"Thanks, Councilor Caveri, for his answer that, for once, honestly, I expected different, precisely because I know that she is a person who prepares himself and who deepens the themes; Instead it has fallen objectively into an answer that is more obvious than Mickey's jokes, and I regret this for two reasons for reasons. The first is that you attempted to try to paint the people who raise a request, who is not to return to the stone age, to live like the Mormons, but it is a request - as has been said correctly by the colleagues of Forza Italia, as well as by the other colleagues who preceded me during the illustration of this initiative, during the general discussion - to have protections and to make insights from the point of view of health. I am not known to be one of those who want to plant the daisies on the highway, so you cannot accuse me of being one who hates modernity, certainly hate impositions, she knows that she and I think differently on vaccination obligations for example, I am for freedom, she is to force people by force, under penalty of social and working death, they were very happy with the obligations of choice. The people who made or did not make a certain health treatment and this marks the difference between us who is absolutely legitimate, as she highlighted. However, if she had had a less ideological approach and more on the merits - because she is capable of making this type of analysis, absolutely, certainly much more than the undersigned who has made less politics than her - and she had limited himself to reading the text, he would have seen that there is no conspiracy theory here, no terrapiattism, no hypothesis of canceling any technological network of our region, but a very simple request, that is to make studies and deepen the theme of the potential risks of the network. She raised the political question and I am happy that she did it, I will obviously answer them in two parts. The first is that if she goes to see, despite the increase of which she has spoken, which is absolutely correct, Italy remains one of the European countries with the lower emissions, with the lowest limits, therefore evidently this increase has been made, but keeping in mind that it was necessary to remain in certain standards, obviously remedying criticism, which rightly recalled - and I think that she does not have to explain to her, above all that she had a cohabitation in the junta with political movements, with political movements. He did not share - But sometimes, when you governing, you must also find a square and sometimes you share things that maybe you don't share, I'm not saying that it happened but I'm talking in general. However, I must also tell you another thing, Councilor Caveri, who on the political question, however, forgets a small step, that is, that this same commitment and this same deepening was approved by the Tuscany Region and not with a motion, but with a resolution of the council. The last time I checked, and control every morning, the Tuscany Region also had its regional control agency. At the moment when you tell us that the Arpa checks are sufficient, it tells us that the Tuscany region is a region of crazy crazy - who have a regional agency that does not work, terrapiattisti, probably also go around with tinfoil on the head so as not to be psychologically manipulated ... - or we can accept the fact that perhaps, having a further study and further study, you can only do good, because maybe she does not say what she says, There is no problem, that everything is fine, or maybe not. This brings me back to my memory what happened this morning and what happened last week during the commission: we asked to make an audition with the entrepreneurial categories to have their opinion, but no, it was said not, because we prefer to avoid that there is perhaps the risk that someone can deny what you say or question it, and here I seem to be exactly in the same alveo. You are afraid to deepen because maybe the results are not expected. Now you see, councilor, we have addressed the debate with the maximum opening, I think you can act, I did not make political issues, I did not make issues, Crusades Terrapiattisti, I simply asked a question that is what she sees, there is somewhere raised an evident possibility that this can harm health, because either we imagine that everything always goes well, or, if we want to put, as you have rightly made the first time, Having placed, we can imagine that science often wonders and has doubts - it is the essence of a demonstration - therefore having this technology recently, even the long -term effects of this technology are not known. If actually what she says is true, then the recommendation of the European Council of 12 July 1999 would have meaning, where you ask to promote research programs in order to improve the knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendation of international community research efforts, it will probably have been an Terrapiattista Europe who does not believe in progress and who wants to reduce everyone to bring the age of the stone or perhaps there are the right concerns. Perhaps, at this point, the Region, which is also governed by the Democratic Party, will actually be a reckless region, and then I advise you to communicate it to colleagues, saying that your colleagues from Tuscany are all crazy and do not understand anything or perhaps maybe ask yourself doubts. Make doubts, having doubts probably also leads to having results that can confirm or deny what we assume, on the one hand and the other. I believe this is a doubt that can come to everyone. She believes she has science infused and saying: ""No, it's not like that"", we are sorry for her, but it is not so for us. We obviously do not collect this motion, clearly we are anxious to see how the vote will be distributed, we have expressed our position and I think it is clear."

You are, in my opinion of course, and I subscribe to what I say, the disappointment of a people, because asking to deepen a theme such as that of electromagnetic waves, on which all the communities ... I mentioned the communities of the Levant Ligurian last time, in which the Ligurian ANCI was activated to ask for insights, and, among other things, the President of the Liguria Region had difficulties on these aspects. We ask you at least to discuss it in the Commission, which, among other things, are secreted, so you cannot even spread the data, not even that ... I mentioned article 191 of the European Treaty, so dear to Councilor Caveri, who pretext the protection of health to economic interests; We all know this, there are large, huge, well -enormous economic interests, we try to protect them, someone is more convinced than others, perhaps no one is against progress. Then if I participate in the manifestations with the no vax I do it willingly, I don't go to see who you attend you, and in any case I don't give a damn. The meaning is that I support the freedom of every Valley citizen to express himself and I also go to listen to him, look a little. The fact that we continue to mention recent studies, assessed, etc. ... I continue to reiterate that the Institute of ICNIRP, the International Commission for Protection from non -ionizing radiation I have told you before, is a private agency, with reduced activity, consisting of an unstorational commission of twelve members, Bavarian, in which there was no doctor - and I have turned to the councilor colleague BARMASSE, That there is no doctor in this hearing. Not even here in this commission there is a doctor, look a little, yet the harp, like all other political governments, relies on this study. Perhaps you do not know, I say this too: in 2020 the Turin Court of Appeal denounced the conflict of interest of the Bavarian icnirp of which I told you before, calling it ""private organization, whose guidelines have a great economic and strategic importance for the telecommunications industry"", with which several icnirp members have links through consultancy relationships. The Turin Court of Appeal always says, sentence of 2020: ""It is clear that these subjects should refrain from evaluating the effect on health, which Icnirp itself has declared safe and not harmful to health"". These are judgments of Italian courts. You smile, as usual continue with this spirit. You are a real disappointment."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,18,3819,"By declaration of vote and to confirm what I had said previously, that is, that we will support this motion, but also to make a consideration more than anything else on the response given by the commissioner Caveri, that is, the heart of the motion, i.e. the need or not to do a specific study. The commissioner says: ""There is no need for a specific study to be done, I don't say it, Arpa says it, it is completely useless because Arpa is within a national system which is also part of Ispra and therefore there are already studies that speak, which document a series of things"". I believe that we all know that Arpa is inside the Snpa system, that is, of the federative system that includes twenty -one agencies for the environment, because there are the two autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano, and which also rightly includes Ispra, but what does this system do? It is a system that collects the studies that the individual agencies make, and then obviously also elaborates lines, gives indications to the other agencies, but I do not understand why our harp could not, in our territory, to do a study with the characteristics that we have highlighted and then obviously sharing it, within the system, reasoning with others, because normally this is what they do, with the supervision of ISPRA, with the relationships that are among the various agencies. To me the motivation leaves a little perplexed, which we cannot change things is fine, it can be absolutely accepted, but contribute to a scientific deepening on a territory that is limited (which perhaps could also be lent to make assessments to share and perhaps to be validated or not validate through the other agencies that on their own territory can do the same action) to me it would seem a fairly sensible thing. Honestly, it is something that left me a little perplexed as a motivation. I would also like to make a clarification, but I believe that the commissioner, when he spoke, did not refer so much to us, then it seems to me that he also explicitly explicit it about the question that there are people who are contrary to 5G. I specified, intervening, that from our point of view this is a technology that must not be demonized, that both the fiber and the 5G can be useful to fill the gap that is there, that is, the fact that our country is poorly still digitized, but this must not be done at the expense of what could be the protection of citizens' health. I do not pretend to say that it is absolutely negative, I have reported opinions that are opinions of scientists, and I think they also have a respectable curriculum, but then, precisely to get to a definition and closure of the circle, all studies that can be done, in my opinion, are useful and can also be used for a wider debate that obviously does not only involve our region. It is obvious that we are within a country system that is very complex, certainly instead I share what the councilor on the fact that, at the level of government decisions, that of moving the limits from 6 volt/metro to 15 is a decision that has been taken at the central level, so it is obvious that this were made on this. Then everyone can have concerns, which are absolutely legitimate, and wanting to deepen, it seems to me that it has been explained, this does not mean that our country was in a situation, compared to other European countries - certainly from my point of view - better, because those 6 volts per meter were, from the point of view of health protection, better than 15, so it was not, it was decided differently and on this there are obviously responsibilities."

We asked for the data of the sponsorships of the contributions between 2021 and 2023, the conspicuous amount touches the million euros, but above all some surprising things emerge, such as the payments to Confindustria Valle d'Aosta for a conference (it is a bit strange that Confindustria was not able to do alone ...), there are a total of 180 thousand euros in favor of the Municipality of Courmayeur and the Foundation and the Foundation and the Foundation Courmayeur, while for many other municipalities the figure is zero. There are contributions to subjects totally external to the Aosta Valley, in Pro Loco in the province of Avellino and Viterbo and then we know that there are refined denials and requests. We therefore want to better understand how we are operating and we want to understand what the recent invitation to dinner has for three journalists of each head operating in the valley. An opportunity to get to know each other and to explain, it is basically said in the invitation, but, if CVA wants to explain its position, convene a press conference and not a dinner. It is an initiative, in our opinion, a little clumsy, which, among other things, embarrasses many people. Cva is at the center of an important discussion on his role and operated and the demonstration comes from the surprising speed with which the IV Commission was convened for next Thursday, with the hearing of the top of CVA, it is not known why, given the vagueness of the agenda and above all the many backgrounds of the Commission. The CVA theme is a delicate question, it is a society on which the media must be able to say in total freedom and without conditioning and that invitation to such a structured dinner seems to us to be an inappropriate form of pressure.

We remember, if I have updated data, but table A should not have changed, therefore which identifies the objectives of additional power, on 2030 you should even arrive in the Aosta Valley at 328 Megawatt, in particular within the decree there was precisely a timing for the application by regional law by the Regions. As for the regions with special statute and the autonomous provinces, there was the safeguard clause. We ask the competent councilor what to date the state of application and the achievement of the objectives set by the areas suitable in the Aosta Valley decree."

The decree in question, the one that gave six months to adopt the appropriate and unsuitable areas by regional law, saw the institution on our part through resolution 1193 of the technical table and the control room that must lead to a bill to be approved in the council by the end of the year, also with the approval of the Council, times that obviously all the regions have found excessively short, but we were in any case Ready to accommodate a first draft law, which, compared to the calendar given by the resolution, had to arrive at the proposal of the junta by 22 November. The sentence of the Council of State changes the conditions to develop the legislation and above all creates an impediment that is currently suspended until February 5, where there will be the expression of merit and obviously creates a situation that does not put us in a position to complete the work as regions. There are two aspects that the Regions have submitted to the attention of the government: a 90 -day extension request for the deadline provided for by the expiry of the decree which is December 30, 2024. An amendment was presented that is hoped to be accepted, precisely to give time to complete this verification and in these days, both the Technical Commission, and the Conference of the Regions, have requested the Ministry to be able to have a technical evaluation compared to the prevented Councils that the Council of State has given compared to Article 20, paragraph 8, of the legislative decree 199/2021. This is for the most bureaucratic and also legal bureaucratic part. I commit myself - there will be a meeting at the beginning of the week of the technical tables - to give it, also for information, what will emerge from this work at the technical table. Compared to the objectives, about 20 megawatts have currently been installed, on the year about 3.4 other megawatts, but it is missing from the GSE - and I finish conclude, I apologize for being long - the enhancement of the hydroelectric production that we know can be differentiated compared to that of photovoltaics."

What is certain is that the more you look at this decree, at least personally, the more the doubts are there, especially on the methods of defining the power objectives, but we also already had it, among other things, spoken during the discussion of the energy plan. Having said that, we thank you for the availability to keep the Council informed and we will try to understand also what the national level evolutions will be, because, among other things, also seeing the objectives of the PNIEC (National Plan Energy and Climate) and those that have instead been the requests and also the times of the authorization of the systems, the mountain to be scaled is very high."

Obviously all this has placed the person in a deep state of humiliation and prostration and rightly the family, who is a careful and present family, has reported and highlighted a profound discomfort for this action.

After washing the boss, in fact scales and crusts were present that prevented the effective application of moisturizing oil. A nurse therefore believed to proceed with the haircut to encourage the application of moisturizing oil on the skin. The day following the request for clarifications by the family members followed the convocation of the same to which the explanations of the case were provided. The family said she understood and accepted the clarifications. The episode is therefore configured as a legitimate agitation in the context of an assessment of the state of health not spoiled by environmental conditioning or by recreational presuppositions, as feared by the request. Instead, we find the use of the board tools again to get to a similar level of inspection detail, because this inspection level could almost make you think that this management level is up to you and/or you, but nobody can be so naive.

It seems that there have been several meetings, always within the structure, to try to understand what happened. The fact that she limits himself to providing, as always, the explanation that justifies a certain type of actions that are absolutely obscene I consider this is instead a serious way of exhilarating the responsibilities that are placed in the head, so I am seriously dissatisfied, we are seriously dissatisfied with her response and obviously we will not stop there."

Categories of the sector. Compared to this interpellation, it is one of those cases in which the intentions, in the specific case those declined in the aforementioned motion of July 2021, then find in reality obstacles other than those imagined. Already in November 2022, following a similar question, the difficulties that emerged in following the commitment of the motion had been taken into account, first of all because, even if it is an entities of the single sector, an agreement is still necessary to proceed with what is in any case a transfer of individual contract, as provided for in article 43, paragraph 4bis, of regional law 22/2010. A series of critical issues have emerged and not yet resolved which, at the moment, also considering that the personnel department has been absorbed by the programming and realization of the competitions of the renewal of the regional collective agreement 2022-2024 for the non-executive staff of the single sector, prevented from activating the work table with the trade union organizations despite having the same department started to work on a proposal in this sense. The nodes to be resolved are: first of all, with reference to the economic treatment, the professional profile of OSS is framed in the B2S position, while the other professional b Category profiles employed by the regional administration of the other entities in the sector are framed in economic position B2. For this staff OSS would therefore determine a reinforcement in a lower economic position, in the face of which it is necessary to define whether the employee maintains the economic treatment of origin and in what way, that is, the new economic treatment of the position new framework must implement. Economic re-catering must be provided by law since the contract is not sufficient. Secondly, mobility with a change of professional profile from a social-health operator to coadjutor cannot be ordered ex officio in the face of a total or partial or partial unsuitability for OSS's duties. In fact, these are very different professional profiles, for whose conversion it would take an aptitude test for the role of job. Again: it must be taken into account that with the acceleration of the digitization of the Public Administration, the professional and administrative profiles of the B2 position category, specialized operator, have necessarily evolved and today ask for much higher technical skills than ten years ago, so much so that the reform of the professional system of public administrations, already intervened at the state level and in the next introduction also at the regional level, provides, as a requirement of access to category B, the diploma and no more medium license. This is why it was postponed to 2026 the performance of the competition for the recruitment of category positions B-B2 positions, with a professional coadjutor profile, to avoid making a competition today by requiring current legislation a qualification that is no longer adequate for the tasks and professional content that category B employees will be called to carry out. In the light of the above, it is therefore not easy to define today the rules for the mobility of the staff with a professional profile of OSS to administrative profiles of the roles of the entities of the unique regional sector before having proceeded to define a new professional system and a new person -class classification system, also because hypothesizing mobility towards other professional profiles of the same category is not proposed the limitations of the working skills of the workers in question."

What we highlight, however, is that there have been people of the OSS category in the time that have been moved, for example, from structures, such as the J.B. Festoz, we talked about it just last advice, in the hospital, perhaps also carrying out a less heavy job, because we cannot say that each department has the same workload, because it is quite evident that those in orthopedics will raise weights, those in an outpatient clinic will most likely carry out another type of work. What is required is if they cannot be placed in concierge, in the switchboards, as it always happened and how it has happened over time on many occasions; If this is no longer possible, perhaps to give the opportunity to move in structures from a certain point of view less heavy even than their workloads. What leaves me even more perplexed is the fact that it is enough to see the many resignations that have occurred and are taking place over time to understand that this professional figure, indispensable for the holding of any healthcare facility, in some way is always little considered: so here are battles to define the usurant work of these figures, that's why it is not given the opportunity to be relocated in perhaps less heavy jobs, when we then pressed the staff as if on other opportunities. Then we get a strike on our heads or we will resign one after the other. I would therefore ask, from this point of view, if the movement within the administrative structures is not practicable, as the president told us, for all the obstacles that are there, to give these people the opportunity to be able to access perhaps less heavy sectors and departments than those they must serve."

With regard to the letter in question, in this question it should be noted that the same was directed by the President of CVA, as well as to the undersigned, to the President of the Regional Council, the President of Finaosta and the Councilor Minelli, as correctly remembered by the interpellation itself. With this letter to the President of Cva, he intended to reiterate, with reference to the question of the PCP council group discussed in this classroom on 22 May, the positions of the company with respect to the procedures for the appointment of the administrative and control bodies of the group company and the discipline of the relative fees. On these points the president of CVA has punctually illustrated the legal motivations of the determinations taken, the strategic and operational conditions that underlie these determinations, the parameters used. Finally, the President of CVA highlighted the fact that the terminology employed by the Councilor risks constituting a reputational damage for CVA and damage to the operation of CVA EOS, as well as damage to the honorability and professionalism of the government and control bodies of the company in question, representing the availability, in compliance with the autonomy and mutual roles, to provide all the required clarifications.

I asked her for just consideration for her role as a final actual owner of the regional investee system. The second point, on the other hand, is a clarification from the undersigned, always on the motivation of the question, because, sees, I do not interest the emoluments, which for me should always take into account the intercurrent relationships of risk and management complexity of the activities to which it is held or the procedures for selecting the administrators or the juniper of internal rules and regulations, on which I still reserve the way to study, rather than the fact that Certain requests or responses, a certain nervousness sometimes in responding, I am not only talking about the political counterpart, often end up understanding anything else and this worries me much more because often the mystery or unbelievation or the secreted can generate much more important reputational consequences of a question or an interpellation.

""None,"" I would have answered like this, but I'm me. I am obviously happy that there is still no information and I hope this is just a ""voice from Senfzzita"". Allow me to do some context so at least we know what we are talking about, yesterday we talked about science, but, if there is a theory that opposes the frontly to science, it is the theory or, better, the gender ideology, or gender, that you want to say. Years ago the thing was quite evident to the point that some of its advocates tried with denial to conceal their existence, but then, by virtue of talking about gender -based violence, of gender discrimination, with fig leaves to mask the propaganda gender rainbow, the absurd theory returned from the window even before being fully left the door. Now under what has been defined during the interview, the court name of Gender Studies has been defined during the interview ... This obviously peeps unfortunately also in what should be the temple of knowing, that is, the university, and all the ambiguity of the courses that are established under this umbrella is in the absolutely not univocal sense that the magical term gender, that is, gender, which can mean different things, even opposite, but in any case it is not attributable to the obvious and anatomic sense biological sex and this is a bit the ambivalence on which you play. This rather ideological and oriented perspective would be aimed at promoting a story and a representation of inclusive and non -discriminatory gender at cultural level, beautiful, even if in reality this does not mean anything. In the United States, from which unfortunately we take inspiration - now we hope that with the advent of Trump a certain quality of a type of studies no longer see the light - there are multiple courses that refer to these theories, the Gender Sensitive Journalism, the social analysis of Gender Equality, language and gender language, genre perspective literatures, literatures and migrations and inequalities, gender statistics, culture, culture, culture, culture, culture, Politics and gender Empowerment, the world, in short, reread in the light of the most famous and constructive gender theory on sexuality. Should this represent a cultural formation or, more easily, and this is objectively a danger, a flattening, a formatting on the thought of the mainstream? We believe it is this second option. The doubt comes, because of gender, instead of the archaic scientific sex, we speak almost everywhere, and in the name of the genre we want to join the male and female baths, you want to authorize the student to change the name based on intimate sensations or allow the male sportsman, who declares to feel like a woman, to compete with biological ladies and young ladies. Any reference to events that occurred during the Olympics is purely desired. If the sexes are only two, according to these theories, unfortunately we know it well, the genres would be dozens, perhaps hundreds and this on the basis of purely subjective, arbitrary and indefinite criteria, but then how to make science without the stops that delimit the field of science? How to establish in fact if Mario Rossi is queer, gender free, asexual or simply not binary? For some time, the spread of the theory Gender has been supplanting the biology and similar sciences, as, among others, they have also recognized the mathematician atheist Piergiorgio Odifreddi or the feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero. Let's hope that the University will soon return to its ancient splendors, or more Galilean science, less subculture gender."

With reference to the application, I report the following data: Roisan Children's Children's Childhood Polo, 0-1 none, 1-2 six children, 2-3 a child; Doues Childhood Polo number four children, 0-1 two children, 1-2 a child, 2-3 a child. Second question: ""What is the activity carried out to date and what are its first assessments"". At the Gignod Grand-Bin school on 3 September 2024, on the occasion of the first college of teachers of the kindergarten for the school year 2024-2025, a working group was established whose teachers of the kindergartens of the institution called ""Allargato 0-6"" group includes. At the college it was established that the working hours of this group will be ten throughout the school year 2024-2025 and that this commitment will be included in the hours provided for by letter a) and letter b) of paragraph 3 article 44 of the national work contract 2019-2021. A restricted group called ""Restricious Group 0-6"" was also formed, which includes only the teachers of the complexes of Doues and Roisan involved directly in the pole to deal with specific needs. Two teachers were appointed as representatives for the enlarged group 0-6, with the task of updating on the regional and national legislation and on the integrated 0-6 system, verbalize the meetings of the Allargato 0-6 group, collect the observations and requests of colleagues, update the part of the PTOF relating to continuity with the nests and the integrated system 0-6, in collaboration with the school manager, inform the school manager compared to the school manager criticality in the application of the integrated system 0-6. Also during the College of September 3, the teachers of the kindergarten of the Grand-Bin institution asked the School Manager to have a meeting with the President of the La Libellula Cooperative for more information on the project ""Polo for the Grand-Brain childhood"". The manager accepted the proposal and promptly contacted the president for the organization of the meeting scheduled for October 16, 2024. The Allarogato 0-6 group has already met in presence at the Variney secondary school on October 2, 2024, from 16:00 to 18:00, on October 16, 2024 from 14:30 to 16:30, on October 30, 2024 from 14:30 to 16:30 and 6 November 2024. The schools. Of the childhood of Etroubles, Gignod, Signayes, Oyace, Valpelline will organize, starting from January 2025, two meetings in which the children of the kindergarten will go to Variney's nursery school for the day on the snow and for animated reading. Subsequently, the children of two and a half years of the nursery will visit the kindergarten for the day of creative or musical activity. In addition to these days that unite all the nursery schools of the entire institution, in this period of experimentation in the municipalities of Doues and Roisan, the children of the kindergarten and kindergarten, considering the proximity, will be able to share some of these activities: to experience moments of meeting to get to know each other and socialize, take part in some common activities to share the routine, share moments relating to the various holidays and events, participate in the exits in the area to go to the library of the territory of the country or walking. The activities listed above will be carried out taking into account the educational-didactic planning, which has already been established by the teachers of the kindergarten at the beginning of the school year considering the interventions of the experts, the didactic outputs and the projects of childhood-prosecutor who have already been approved in the teaching staff. The teachers underline the importance of maintaining the identity of the kindergarten in compliance with mutual specificities, (nursery/childhood) recalling that for many years a nursery-childhood continuity has already been present among the children of the last year of the nest, two and a half years, and the children of the three-year kindergarten. This bridge project has always been functional. The programming hours and the number of meetings are not quantified in order to allow a free didactic choice for the schools of Doues and Roisan. Since it is an experimental project, the verification in itinere will also be foreseen in order to collect observations and to monitor the meetings from time to time in order to be able to conclude the project with a qualitative analysis. The next meetings of the Allargato 0-6 group are scheduled for March 12 from 2:30 pm: 30: 30 and for March 26 from 2:30 pm 30-30: 30. The latter will be held in the presence of Dr. Christina Arfuso, a technical manager at the superintendence for studies who, with circular sent to schools, made himself available to carry out information meetings at the request of educational institutions. The agenda of the two meetings will be defined together with the teachers. On Friday 18 October the inauguration of the Nido of Doues was held, attended by the children of the primary kindergarten of the plexus together with their teachers; We are waiting for the inauguration date of the Roisan Nido in which the children of the kindergarten and primary school of the complex will be invited to participate together with their teachers. The first assessments highlight a collaboration started in a systematic and shared way. As can be detected from a pedagogical-didactic point of view, it is necessary to wait a few more months."
48002,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Asili nido",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,4,185,Thanks Councilor for the Reply. Also in this case I kindly ask you for the photocopy to be able to compare the data. We reserve a further evaluation for further initiatives.
48003,XVI,21/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,2,6782,"I respond to the requests of the Councilor Lucianaz on the 5G antennas, of which we have already partially spoken yesterday afternoon. I must say that the law 16/2024, which we have recently reviewed in the regional law 25/2005, has as its purpose the unitary management of public workstations in the territory of the Region. You will remember that the great part of the infrastructures were owned by the Unités des Communes or the municipalities and passed through or, better, are passing through the Region. From this point of view, there are, in line with national regulations, a rationalization and optimization of the planning and the realization of the sites equipped for radio and telecommunications of public ownership stations. The changes made, which have been approved by this Council, aim to adapt the rule to the organizational management context, allowing, as I said, to formalize the transfer of ownership of the infrastructures of radio and telecommunications of local authorities. On the one hand there is a question of rationalization, as I said, and, on the other, there is also the fact that in the interlocution that must have on these types of infrastructure certainly an administrative structure such as that of the region has greater strength and also greater authority. The problem of the information that has been asked remains, we have included in the revision of Law 25 the paragraph 5bis, which says: ""In order to optimize the planning and construction of public ownership stations on the regional territory, the regional structure responsible for telecommunications can request telecommunication operators or to the infrastructure operators of telecommunications information regarding the programming for the construction of new stations of radio stations on the region"". This is a novelty, because in fact the great players, in the case of the Aosta Valley, are substantially two, which make those infrastructures, that is, those pylons on which several operators are then positioned; Today as today, they did not have by law any type of interlocution with the Region, which therefore had difficulty understanding the future programming above all. Now, based on the law I said, it has just been modified, we have sent letters to the different interlocutors to have greater clarity on the expanding situation. Meanwhile, we said of the cartography that reports the different types of antennas installed in the area. These technical data are the responsibility of the individual operators who must compulsorily communicate to the authority for the guarantees in communications (AGCOM), which is an independent authority that was established in 1997. Among the different skills of AGCOM there is the construction and maintenance of the data bank of the existing Internet access networks on the national territory, this is on the basis of article 22 of the communications code that dates back to 2024. State of development of the internet access offer to the single address and to make comparative assessments on the different technologies and speed. The information and contents required is the exclusive competence of the telecommunication operators themselves, who manage the policies and technical specifications that concern their radio control networks independently and independently. Below is the connection, I will give it to the councilor, to the AGCOM portal of the publication of the database of the access networks, therefore, by way of example, you will find all the data requested by you, but by way of example I will give you an extraction of a cover of the coverage of the territory of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta with the 5G technology in band 3.4 GHz-3.8 GHz and she will see from this colored map where the different positions are And, entering the AGCOM website, he will see the specific area by the area. The competent regional structure - in part I have already said the following - has long started contacts with the infrastructure operators of radio and telecommunications to know these development plans in execution of this article 5bis of the new rewriting of law 25 and formally asked to be able to know the information relating to the programming and the realization of the new radio electric stations on the regional territory, such information is not yet received. I must say that the attitude of these companies that manage these stations is a very distant attitude from respect for local autonomies, I have already said yesterday, this derives from the fact that current legislation is a legislation very favorable to the 5G integration not only in the terms that we discussed yesterday more than the doubling of the quantity of radio frequency allowed today of the law, but also from that reform of the recent law by the Italian Parliament, municipal, which were those that could propose some type of exception compared to the technical choice of installation in a certain area; Unfortunately, this is a sad obvious obviously compliance with a fire power of these telecommunications companies in the name of course in this case in particular that the plan concerning the extension of 5G is closely linked to the need for spending on the PNRR funds and therefore the government choice was to accelerate as much as possible to avoid any type of interference, also positively positive, by local authorities. Local authorities, I respond to the last application, are directly involved in the authorization process provided for by the current regulation, it passes through the procedures referred to in the single door. The regional structures will however take charge of communicating to local authorities the programming information that will perish from the findings of the radio and telecommunication operators or operators involved in the realization of the new stations. I have to say frankly that, when we inserted in the reform of law 25 this provision of information by the transfers of the pylons, we had doubts that the government could in some way exist a legitimacy of this rule, brandishing, as sometimes has happened in the past, the principle of a distribution of powers, therefore of an hypothetical unconstitutionality of a request from our part to affect structures of this kind. Fortunately, the rule has not been challenged and therefore we will do everything possible in order to have a great clarity the future planning for the realization of 5G networks."
48003,XVI,21/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,2892,"Councilor, today I have to thank you for the tone and for the completeness of the answer and perhaps, by virtue to clash, I have to sincerely thank you, also because the answer is complete and satisfactory. There are critical issues, they do not hide: one our poor autonomy ... because here it is already a success, from what she said, that with article 5bis the region can request information from these communication monsters, therefore, if we are reduced to this, clearly we do not go to the side of sovereignty on our territory certainly. As for Agcom, she rightly told me that she is an independent body, but it must relate to Parliament, that is, there is still a parliament that must verify what is combining on the territory. I remind you that only recently - yesterday we talked about the Tuscany Region who about two months ago adopted this decision to deepen the research - Commissioner Agcom Giacomelli wrote at a certain point to the president of Tuscany: ""What is certain is that at the idea that Tuscany becomes the promised land of terraciattisti, no vax conspiracy theorists of various kinds I will never resign myself"". This is the air that pulls in AGCOM, however, apart from this, I had asked for these insights because the whole 5G story was born badly and is not working better. I remind you that on May 5, 2019 AGCOM approved the use of frequencies for 5G without authorization of any ethical committee, without informed consent, without preventive risk assessment, nor environmental and health monitoring. Three days later, 8 May 2019, AGCOM deliberated for the beginning of the experimentation of the three 5G bands for two years in 120 municipalities in Italy to the knowledge of the citizens but unbeknownst to the mayors themselves and continue like this. The last measure is worrying in my opinion, then I have no other information, the provision of the law cited by her, that of 31 December 2023, from what I know, was not subjected to any evaluation by the unified conference of local authorities and there were not few mayors who were worried about this extension. The whole affair of 5G, beyond the fact that one can be favorable or not of a driven technology, worries about the ways in which it is made. As for the appearance of the installation of the 5G antennas, it is a concern of many people, yesterday I told you in the classroom that only yesterday in Milan have decided to place a thousand antennas out of a thousand lampposts of the city precisely because there is this need to have an antenna at least every 100-150 meters, I do not know in the Aosta Valley that choices will be made, but yesterday's request, not to return to the same topic, was to ask for more information and more confrontation. We hope that the register will be changed soon. Thanks anyway."
48004,XVI,21/11/2024,AGRICOLTURA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992.0,M,PA,2,3773,"In responding to his initiative I want to briefly remember the process that regulates the provision of payments of the advances provided for by the CAP. With regard to the 2024 campaign, I remember that we are referring to two distinct programming: that of the PSR 2014-2022 and that of the CSR 2023-2027 and that for both, starting from October 16 of this year, the Member States can pay advances up to 75% for direct payments and up to 85% for rural development interventions based on the surface and animals. It should also be noted that the Ministry of Agriculture of Food Sovereignty and Forests has entrusted to Agea the activation of the necessary procedures useful to allow the payment of advances by paying bodies. With regard to direct payments, Agea Coordination, with its own circular, defined the prizes affected by this advance, as well as the maximum percentage of advance disburseable and the unitary amount of the same. The interventions that most affect Valley farmers are basic payment, redistributive support, payment of young farmers and ecoschema 1. On the other hand, instead of rural development interventions, on 4 October 2024 a plenary meeting Agea regions aimed at planning the activities necessary for the payment of the questions of the campaign 2024 was held. Direct, Agea made 1,178 liquidations, for a total of 2,222,430.25 euros, while, in relation to rural development interventions, no company has now obtained the payment of advances. Remaining in the field of rural development 2023-2027, the Valle d'Aosta region required Agea the provision of the advances of the SRA 30, animal welfare, and SRB 01, compensatory allowances, rapid annual payments, which play a priority role. At the request of the Region, AGEA therefore prepared the creation of the automated payment list of the advance relating to the SRA 30 intervention, which affects 598 beneficiaries and an amount disbursed equal to € 1,166,171.37. With regard to the second and third question, I point out that the advances are normally paid by Agea by 30 November of each year. As an example, the advances of the 2023 campaign of the SRA 30 intervention were issued on November 28, 2023 November 30th. I can therefore say that, considering the usual timing of providing advances, we cannot speak to a real delay in the liquidations of these measures to date. As regards SRA 08 interventions, the agro-drovitory, the SRA 29, organic agriculture, of the CSR 2023-2027, activated for the first time in Valle d'Aosta this year in the 2024 countryside, were the subject of the last technical meeting between Agea and the Regions, which took place on Friday 15 November, during which it emerged that the implementation of the new algorithms could request a longer timing compared to an ordinary year. The definitive regional supply by the VDA area of ​​the data necessary for the provision of these advances took place on the following Monday, that of November 18, 2024. Agea reassured the regions on the fact that on the SRA 29 intervention, therefore organic agriculture, of particular interest in our region will be given priority for development."
48004,XVI,21/11/2024,AGRICOLTURA,en,Planaz,Dino,1972.0,M,RV,4,1652,"Thanks Councilor for the Reply. I want to clarify that the title of initiative is not of my spontaneous will, it has come out of the offices, but it is understandable. We know very well that the deposit of the advances from European directives cannot be paid before October 16, goes until November 30 and then we must see the practices of the companies if they coincide with the commitments requested, but following all its list of aid - and thank you for the clarity of the answer - a doubt arises, but we will then evaluate with other acts, but she said that the Valdostan breeders have the right To ecoschema 1 and did not tell me about ecoschema 2. Ecoschema 2, just to clarify it, is the ecoschema that is most representative in our region, is the ecoschema linked to the grazing of animals, an ecoschema of significant importance both from an economic point of view but also from the point of view of animal welfare that I do not see mentioned in its response, if you may have it in different ways or then. type of initiative. We are pleased that the aid continues, taking into account the new programming that began for a quantity of measures last year, but to go to the operation we go to its time. We hope that the advances will be disbursed in scheduled times and that they can give some support to companies in a period like this at the end of the season where the (incomprehensible) ended where there is a whole series of economic commitments by the same and to be able to face also for the organization of everything related to the winter and subsequent season."
48005,XVI,21/11/2024,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992.0,M,PA,2,2764,"On 29 October 2024, the Legambiente Valle d'Aosta Association sent natural resources to the Councilor for Agriculture and, for information, to the information bodies, a note in which he reported a hunting excess relating to the fallen fallen on the regional territory during the 2024-2025 hunting season. The question emerged during the meeting of the regional fauna council of 31 May 2024, where the news regarding the hunting calendar for the 2024-2025 season were illustrated. At that time, the representative of the local authorities expressed concern about the increase in the number of foxes that approach more and more frequently to inhabited centers, creating numerous inconvenience and risking to spread diseases. In this regard, I emphasize that between 2023 and 2024 the competent structures confirm 56 cases of cimurro on Volpi and Mustelidi in our region. Although not dangerous for man, cimurro is a pathology that directly affects wild and domestic carnivores, in particular dogs at a young age. It manifests itself with problems for the nervous system, which risk causing possible paresis, or with respiratory complications. It spreads by direct contact, through urinary and fecal excretions or through contaminated food. Volpi are also a target species also with regard to the health surveillance of anger. I want to reiterate that in our region there is no reduction roof for this species and that the hunting calendar does not provide for any note of merit in this regard. However, the Regional Committee for Hunting Management has the right to assign internal regulations of the notes of merit for the reduction of this animal. The proposal to encourage the reduction measures of the Volpi population was therefore implemented at the meeting of the Committee with resolution no. 22/2024 of 8 August 2024, which, in its autonomy, has decided to assign a merit score equal to 0.5 points for each fourth fallen and conferred on one of the control centers on the regional territory. In this document it is also specified that the fox must be regularly recorded and incarnate. The interest on me and the competent offices regarding this issue is concrete and constant, as already reiterated in my response on November 4th in Legambiente. In the face of the critical issues related to the disposal of the carcasses that have been reported to me, as well as were reported to the offices of the Natural Resources Department, I personally reported to the Committee, which issued an information note on the correct management of the chief game chiefs on 18 October."

I took inspiration in presenting this question from the fact that Legambiente has sent a letter to the councilor highlighting a hunting excess for the fox species. Therefore, starting from the assumption that the hunt for the fox is foreseen, as the commissioner well recalled, in the 2024-2025 hunting calendar in a wandering or harnessed mode, what surprises me is the report of Legambiente. Personally, the hunting activity for eight years has been practicing and I have never come across the carcasses of faded and abandoned Volpi in our woods. Among other things, I would like to remember, as the commissioner also highlighted, that the foxes are wild animals and as such they must remain also not near the urban centers and let alone animals that can be dangerous and harmful. For this reason, an increase in demolished garments can be linked to a possible diffusion of some disease, such as anger or cimurro, or simply to proper hunting. At this point we take note of his response we share."

""If it corresponds to the truth that at least one owner has not given the availability to his land for the purposes of the snowpark"": yes, he corresponds to the truth that an owner has not given the availability of the Monterosa area pursuant to Law 9/1992, but authorizing, only for the 2024-2025 season, the management of the area in the configuration prior to the start of the new authorization process. ""If the aforementioned treadmill is actually brought to Staffal"", mention was mentioned in the premises: ""Taken known that the long treadmill would be brought to Staffal ..."", yes, also because for the second season otherwise it would have been not used, this does not create problems for the future because there will be a regular application for financing on law 8/2004 for the purchase of a further carpet that will be destined for the Snowpark of Gressoney-Saint-Jean once clearly completed the authorization process and the procedure for the realization of investments, therefore also to avoid maintaining an unused infrastructure this choice was made, but this does not affect the future investment work. Point 4: ""If the Weissmatten Snowpark will open regularly for the winter season and in case if completely with all the treadmills or only partially"". The Snowpark will open in its previous configuration and prior to the start of the new authorization process, therefore with the service proposal that has been used so far, so there are no stop at the service and at the moment the investment proposed pursuant to the problem that has emerged, but which is obviously is being evaluated by the owners is not achieved. We have received in recent days, the questioner, the councilor Minelli, a note from the owner, whom I do not know, I first learned informally also by the colleague who does not even know her, who wanted to have his version of the facts with respect to the existing situation. I felt it personally, I asked her if I could also send this note to the company to have their own version also in response to the things that have been anticipated. In the next few hours I will send both communications to the group leaders in order to have full knowledge of the things that are exposed and the situation that is in place at the moment compared to the use of the area. However, what I think is important is to clarify that the snowpark will open in the previous configuration, all infrastructures will be used as so far proposed and the process will be completed during the year and then realizes the investment for the 2025-2026 season."
48006,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,4531,"Thanks for the reply. The councilor said that, responding to colleague Lavy last February and then to me in March, he had entered the merits of the Snowpark issue, that our initiatives were more generally on the Weissmatten area, but we had also dealt with that question and had been explained to us that the treadmill was not at that moment in operation, both because - this had said the councilor - rightly there was no enough Being brought like snow and I had been told that many trucks had to pass, in reality with a cat you could move the snow ...), and then because - it had been rightly said - there were not all the authorizations and among these authorizations the procedure for obtaining the availability of the areas had been mentioned. We then know that the carpet had been dismantled to start the artificial snow -snowing works, which however are not at the moment and are not concluded. Then we learned of a further criticality from the territory, which was precisely the lack of availability from all the owners who granted Monterosa to install that carpet, so we presented the question to know the state of the art. I then also verified the situation, before depositing, because the work of the laying of the carpet, the usual traditional one, then had not even started, then instead in the days just preceding the Council I verified that instead something had started. Now on the question of authorizations, the commissioner says that the process went on, but it is not concluded, because it confirms that there is a problem related to this owner. He also said a little while ago that we both received this letter; I do not know the lady too, I did not telephouse them, but I read what she wrote to us and I am happy that the councilor in some way welcomes the will of the lady who asked to read the letter in the advice, it will not be read but will reach the group leaders, but essentially - and this seems correct to say - what do you say? It has been said that there has always been the willingness to give the land, both those of the Snowpark, and others who have this lady in Trinité, to the Monterosa company to carry out its activities, but in compliance with the contracts, contracts that have been declared valid, also recently by a sentence of the Court of Appeal of Turin, which has sentenced the company to pay a previous until 2018 or 2020, I will not remember, then the situations of the following years will remain. However, there is an availability, and this is highlighted in the letter, even to discuss these contracts, there is no unilateral position: either it is held up, that is, it is so or we do it, either we do not give any authorization. And what makes me species is that there is not, from the counterparty, an equally willingness to discuss and deal, because, from what we learn - and then you will see it - in response to a still recent letter or a communication, I don't know, I do not remember the formula well, that the owner has given for the availability of the land, in compliance with the contracts, the answer was a letter in which it is said that the contracts are terminated! Now I am not an expert, I don't know if it is possible to make a unilateral termination of a contract, I don't know, but it seems to me that, from the point of view of the attitude, there is something that is not going well. Then there was also the announcement that will be resorted to the Court of Cassation, but this had already anticipated him to my answer some time ago the commissioner, just when I had talked about that sentence in a response in the classroom. This means what? It means waste of money for everyone, it means time, it means a dispute that can go on again for a long time. It would seem much more useful for everyone, for the community then, at the end of the accounts, that you put around a table and discuss in a serene way. This does not happen. The lady asks, among other things, to be treated also with education and I have no doubt that this request has foundations, because we know well, we have seen several times how things work ... so you will be able to read and make your evaluations. My invitation, however - and I do it through the commissioner of course, because it is the commissioner of reference - is that with the company there is the possibility of reaching different attitudes, because this does not bring us anywhere."

As for the first question, the Consulta is being established, we sent the letters to the Departments, to the Bodies, we are also looking for - we talked about it the other day together with a component of an association that represents the chassis mobility - the methods for assigning the composition of the Consulta to the reference associations, so this is a job that is in progress, because, as we know, there are components to be appointed that represented the councilors. Cpel, but also the reference associations, so we also asked CONI in this regard, so there is an ongoing job. We are constituting the Consulta and we are also completing the establishment of the office that will deal with sustainable mobility. An official has also been taken through competition and the further assignment of an accounting assistant who will finally allow us to have - if he will probably also probably also probably also probably at the time of his department period - a structure that can govern future planning, is also carried out, both of everything he will have to represent, also for the regional transport plan, the cycling mobility, that the coordination actions with the various councilors. I remember that the tourism Department proposes cycling mobility to grow it as an attraction and as the possibility, on which to give opportunities for fun to free time both of the Aosta Valleys and of those who will be our guests and the councilor of Councilor Sapinet deals with the realization of the investments. The task of the structure that has been built and which will become more and more operational in the coming months is an important task, also of connection with all the subjects who can help us grow cycling mobility, especially sweet mobility in the Aosta Valley. As for point 2: ""If it can be convened in time to provide useful indication for the purposes of participating in the notice relating to the aforementioned project"", it will depend a little on the time now for response; Certainly the Consulta will begin its activity between the end of the year and the first days of the new year, because I imagine that this can be the goal by everyone. Compared to the notice, we have had the opportunity to speak with the commissioner Sartore in the municipality of Aosta to also connect to the objectives that the municipality intends to achieve with this proposal and also to make sure to activate a useful working table with all the subjects, taking into consideration that there will be this important notice, but above all that these activities will continue and the role of the consultation will be important precisely to have the opinion of all the subjects to develop projects in line with the objectives in line with the objectives in line with the objectives in line with the objectives We will intend to reach. The guidelines for cycling mobility are contained in the general plan of urban and suburban cycling mobility of the Ministry of Infrastructure and have been drawn up in Valle d'Aosta in 2019 in the first draft of the regional plan, even if then it has been afraid for the question relating to Covid and we are now resuming the activity that will lead us to have, within the proposal of the regional transport plan, also a renewed edition of the plan for the Cycling Mobility regional. There are therefore numerous activities in progress, also an important connection both with the Municipality of Aosta and with local authorities and full operation will take place in the coming months. I must say that, hearing a little bit all the subjects interested in the objective, there is a pleasure and interest to start this work, which will be an important job to be developed together, also to relate the many designs and investments that are on the territory and the promotions that local authorities have also started to make on the projects carried out."
48007,XVI,21/11/2024,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,3,4330,"As the commissioner also recalled, we established, with the law that changed the 16/2019, the Consulta for Cycling Mobility with the aim of obviously to support the policies of the interventions in the field of sustainable mobility with a lower environmental impact. This question was descended from the fact that we wanted to have awareness of what had been sent up to here, in particular to know if the Consulta had been officially established, we had also asked for it in relation to this notice that he mentioned the commissioner, who is not a call from the Municipality of Aosta, but is of the Ministry for Sport, a notice that is called ""Bike in common"" and provides for the implementation of cycling mobility in the various municipalities. Cycle tourism, but also projects for schools, redevelopment projects and so on and the applications must be presented between November 7 and January 13, 2025. One of the needs to present the projects is also to have a little common guidelines for what concerns signs and other aspects, with a view to having a platform for cycling in the future. The councilor tells us that the Consulta is being constitution, therefore it is not yet formally constituted, and also feeling what he told us, that is, that he will enter full operation between the end of this year and the beginning of 2025, for the purpose for which I had a little asked for clarifications, that is, to give indications also for this call, there will be no contribution. Beyond this, the will was also a bit to solicit the continuation of the works, therefore the settlement of this consultation really. She said, councilor, that you have heard the reference associations because they must appoint their representative in the Consulta and also the Coni, I imagine that among the reference associations there is Fiab à vélo, because it is then the most representative one, if not perhaps at this moment the only one we have in the area. This is certainly very important, but what I would like to underline is that, when we talk about cycling mobility, we are talking about something more complex than a sport, a sporting, recreational, free time activity, that is, we speak of a different way of moving, moving people, objects, goods in some cases, therefore it goes in the perspective of a connection to the transport network through the use of the bicycle, therefore a consultation that occupies a chassis mobility, even for the purposes of chassis. Consultative, because then this is what this body will do, must take this into account and therefore not focus only or mainly on the sports aspect. Well the thing he told us, that is to say the implementation of the staff in the office for sustainable mobility, which is important, because we know that without resources it is difficult to follow the various issues. Allow me to say one thing, however: within this consultation, where we know they must also be appointed by the three reference councilors of people, therefore its department, the councilor of Councilor Sapinet and the Department of Grosjacques, there would also be the interest in having people such as - I do not say this - the mobility manager, that is, people who have an idea of ​​what sustainable must be sustainable Beyond the aspects linked mainly to tourism, because, in our opinion, even everything related to the ""bike to school"" or ""bike to work"" part, which is what in many realities is going on, in our region would find its raison d'etre. The Consulta will therefore take place, I believe that it will also have to have an attention in its composition to these aspects, so we obviously solicit attention. One last joke, two seconds, I am so sorry that that project, that part of sustainable mobility, which was already in the 2019 transport plan, then was put aside because of the Covid. I say this as a joke: I received a cartoon from a friend who said this morning: ""And then you realize that 2025 is in a month and a half and Covid was 5 years ago and 2050 is as close as 2000!"", So you have to be careful because time passes very quickly."

First of all, I thank the colleague for the attention he poses and has placed on this question, also for the constructive comparisons on the margin then of the work of the classroom. As part of the interventions that the Regional Administration has promoted for extraordinary maintenance and the safety of the regional road network, these works to improve the safety and redevelopment of the regional road n. 8, from kilometer 2,100 to kilometer 2,600, according to lot in the municipality of Antey-Saint-André, with a total amount of € 585,000. The intervention consists in remaking a degraded stroke of masonry of the regional road n. 8, including precisely between the progressive above, for an extension therefore of 500 meters, as well as the positioning of a new road barrier and the maintenance of the road surface. The works allow you to complete the improvement of the safety of the aforementioned section, already started with the previous functional lot, which has provided for the enlargement of the roadway through the construction of a reinforced concrete structure for a total amount at the time of € 1,125,000. As part of the works envisaged of the second functional lot, the construction of the support masonry envisaged in the project and the related curbs has been completed. Specific New Jersey were also positioned for the protection of the lateral edge of the road. Currently on the stretch of regional road in question, the alternating one -way has been removed, therefore a restoration of a double sense road network, without limitation. Finally, we inform you that the laying of road barriers and the asphalting of the stretch of road will also be expected to consider the climatic conditions of the period that are not compatible with such processes. I also add that in the coming weeks we will meet with the municipal administration of La Magdeleine, a consolidation intervention of the bridge that leads to the capital and the town of La Magdeleine to the monitoring carried out in the years 2021-2022, the realization of an alternative roads, is in anticipation, so that it could then be able to intervene on the bridge, an intervention that was reprogrammed following the flood event."

As you have already expressed in the answer of my question, beyond that that stretch of road frequently transit, many reports had come to me that more than anything else there was this alternate one -way that creates difficulties for traffic. We certainly understand all the difficulties of the companies that have to complete the works and perhaps on the scheduled times or perhaps of the inconveniences that are there, also due to the flood of last June 30, which created further changes of destination, of contracts of the companies that had to concentrate its energies to go and give urgent answers, where perhaps there was more need. The circulation has been reopened, even if we understand very well that, although the asphalt of the roadway, it will go in the period that is more congruous, because we know very well that at the moment it is not possible. We thank for the collaboration that there was because we have given an answer to the locations that really needed it."

The colleague questions the regional government to find out what the state of the art of interventions relating to the safety of the area affected by the calamitous event of this summer is, as well as about the laying of the bridges of the catwalks functional to the connection of the two banks, as well as the access of the slopes and numerous tourist structures in the locality. Following the alluvial event of 29 and 30 June 2024, the Hydraulic Works structure carried out the disalveo activities of the 500 meters of Cervino stream that cross the inhabited center of the Breuil, staff of the hydraulic works structures, which I thank because, when a part of them was operational in that of Cogne, the other part of the structure presided over the situation in the Breuil-Cervinia with some employees who have also returned to times. Truly restricted by holidays, therefore what also worthy of reporting. Subsequently then they were positioned to replace the parapets along the bank of the watercourse and the new jersey in concrete to increase the safety frank compared to the previously existing conditions. It was then possible to reconstruct a reinforced concrete wall on the orographic left to protect the watercourse in the beaten upstream of via Carrel. These interventions are currently concluded. Parallel to these works, a punctual monitoring system has been installed on the watercourse which is able to identify the passage of a flow of debris in the basin upstream of the inhabited center. The monitoring system, once installed, was delivered to the municipal administration for its operational management in terms of civil protection, a system similar to that positioned the previous year following the events of Bionaz and Oyace. An assignment of study and design of works in two distinct extracts of the Cervino torrent were then entrusted, which concern in particular two containment basins of the debrite flows that immediately succeed one away downstream of the track n. 5 and upstream of the inhabited center and then the renovation of the arguments of the Cervino stream along via Bich until the confluence with the Marmore stream, going to modify the slopes of the riverbed and transform the bridge of via Carrel, which is currently a carbile bridge, into a pedestrian bridge to allow to dispose of the flow values ​​comparable to those that occurred on the occasion of the late month of June 2024. They will obviously be the subject of comparison and concertation with the municipal administration. The designers in charge are completing the technical-economic feasibility project of the intervention as a whole with the aim of acquiring the opinion of the Authority of the District of the River Po. This opinion is binding for the financing of the works through state funds of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Safety, which are around € 8,100,000. We will therefore proceed with the drafting of the executive projects of the works, works that are intended to start carrying out at the beginning of next spring. As regards the catwalks, the Municipality of Valtournenche has made it exclusively - this must be specified - for the winter season, three crossings to connect the center with the area of ​​the ski slopes and with the tourist facilities."

We hope that the three catwalks can return to 5, or in any case that there may be the same possibility of passage that there was previously. I do not know what the situation is today, however, unfortunately, placed the catwalks, the snow has arrived, the catwalks cannot be crossed because the shoulder of the catwalks has not been completed, so the catwalks substantially, from the information I have, are not accessible because the snow has arrived, so we hope that as soon as possible the shoulders of the bridges and the catwalks can be completed in such a way as to make the passage that would otherwise be unnecessary. There is also a question linked not only to reaching the track bottom, the track start or the start of the Matterhorn, but also a security theme, because the premises are however beyond the bridge and, if there is the need to pass an ambulance or anything else, there is the need not of a catwalk but of a bridge as it was previously there. Having said that, we, as we had already announced during the discussion of the economy and finance document with the agenda, we will keep the surveillance of the situation and we reserve the right to make further initiatives precisely because, I repeat, there is a will to keep attention on an area on which we intervened, on which you will have to intervene, because, as she himself said, it is not that it is all finished, there are steps to carry on. We hope that it can be redeveloped and secured, as you have invested and how they will invest upstream to avoid repeating the situation. It is an area, among other things, that in the season it is heavily urbanized and therefore needs greater safety. Soon what we hope is that the catwalks can be made available to citizenship and tour operators as soon as possible."
48010,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Alcolismo e tossicodipendenze, Politiche giovanili",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,7516,"Coming to the first question, that is ""to know what are the actions put in place to counteract youth discomfort"", more specifically the intake of substances that alter the perception of reality, the so -called ""youth discomfort"" is a concept that, in reality, simplifies a series of emotional, psychological and social difficulties that young people can live, including individual, family, school, social and cultural factors. The complexity of the phenomenon can translate into different situations ranging from the abuse of substances to the conclated psychiatric disorder, to marginality, up to school leaving and lack of perspectives; Therefore it is clear that the adequate response cannot consequently be unique, nor of exclusive health competence. However, coming to the health world, the service for pathological addictions, therefore the Serd of the USL company, currently provides for a multidisciplinary team dedicated to minors, that is, young and adults until 26 years old, who is made up of a psychiatrist, a nurse, three psychotherapist psychologists, a social worker and a professional educator. The taking charge of patients who turn to the Serd sees a first phase of reception and multidisciplinary diagnosis that provides for different talks with specialists. Then follows the return of the individualized therapeutic plan in which a diagnosis are defined, the objectives to be pursued, the expected results, the methods of implementing the various interventions to be prepared, the realization times, the verification and evaluation times of the processes and results. These are also identified, compared to the operators representatives of the case on the basis of the therapeutic program outlined. It is therefore good to specify that abuse or dependence on drugs, rather than drugs, alcohol or screen in minors and/or young adults, almost always represents a secondary and associated phenomenon that originates from a problematic psychic functioning in evolutionary development. From a more strictly psychopathological point of view, in addition to dependence, there can be several disorders, personality, learning from attention deficiency and hyperactivity, conduct rather than psychotic spectrum. According to the prevailing pathology or the relevance of the problems, the Serd, therefore the employee service, directs the competent service according to the memorandum of understanding or the agreements between services, therefore either to childhood neuropsychiatry or psychiatry, in cases over 18 years of age, and/or at the psychosocial services of the minor area. The types of services performed by the Serd are medical visits, psychological interviews and psychotherapy, educational and social interviews, taking nursing, the alcohological program intensive detoxifying intensive, psycho-educational groups for both minor patients and young people and for their family members, the clinic on tabagism, the clinic for innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation. The latter, which we have approved, among other things, in September 2024, is for our region - first in Italy - free of charge in favor of resident assisted people with pathological addictions and psychiatric and neurological disorders, therefore included in the context of regional additional Lea. Other regions are studying and copying it, however, applying costs that are dramatic, naturally outside any coverage of the additional Lea. As far as prevention concerns, we remember that the same represents Serd through a specific work team and deals with starting a series of initiatives in an organic and stable manner whose purposes are: intercepting young people before they begin to manifest a discomfort through the use of substances, therefore primary prevention, or with compulsive behaviors and/or before they become employee, therefore secondary prevention; reduce the socio-health costs related to the use/consumption of old and new generation substances; constantly monitor the phenomenon of substance consumption in our region. The ongoing health promotion projects are as follows: the program of Serd prevention initiatives for the school year 2024-2025, which provides for interventions in schools on addictions to compulsive substances and behaviors; listening counters; The Week of Legality in collaboration with the Permanent Technical Table Legality and intergenerationality. The Youngle Vda project, financed with Gap State Funds, on the pathological gambling, recently started recently through an application to be installed on the mobile phone that proposes a virtual space where teenagers can chat by chatting their problems in an anonymous way, therefore without hierarchies and therefore between peers, is also of strategic importance. This is the most innovative and functional aspect: young people dialogue with other young people specially trained and constantly supported by a specialized psychologist and educator who therefore provide support and guarantee timely and professional responses to the needs of the children involved. There are also numerous collaborations with the school world of the Department of Collega Guichardaz through the Permanent Technical Table Legality Intergenerationality, of the schools that adhere to the prevention initiatives promoted by the Serd and for each school year and in schools where the Serd counter is active, of the class councils, offering advice and comparison for students who are in charge of the Serd itself. The network work is therefore guaranteed also thanks to the various technical tables and working groups that have been set up over time, therefore the permanent technical table legality intergenerationality already mentioned, the working group on bullying, the interinstitutional table for the prevention of suicide, the working group of psychic discomfort in adolescents. Compared to the contrast to bullying, with resolution 681 last June 2024, together with the offices of the councilors of colleagues Guichardaz and Grosjacques, we have started the analysis and planning path of a project aimed at experimentation in our region of the antibullying certification model. The projects that are being carried out go precisely with a view to rationalizing the current dense network of collaboration between different bodies and sectors, health, school, training, work, justice, to guarantee as much as possible an early and effective taking charge. We are therefore convinced that it is increasingly important to speak openly about the forms of discomfort, as we are doing, for example, together with the association Il Mandorlo Fiorito in the context of the prevention of suicide, both to break down stigma, fears and prejudices, and to bring people closer by increasing the sense of community. We must field every tool useful to support our young people who need to develop greater resistance to the negative influence of some social models of our times. The goal is therefore to help them increase self -awareness, promoting self -protection and psychophysical well -being. Last but not least this Monday in the resolution on needs and in the allocation of resources regarding all services towards minors, of course we have increased both the needs and the allocations."

The complaint that had been made by the director of the Serd who had denounced alarming numbers had raised a series of questions and concerns in those who had read this data. I remind them only for the benefit of the classroom, numbers that tell us that the young patients were 166 in the first half of 2024, then 166 boys in six months, 49 in the age group up to 19 years, 117 between 19 and 25 years old. Unfortunately, the director of the Serd called it this: ""The most drugged era of human history"", is certainly a danger, a serious danger that unfortunately the younger generations run and, as has been said - and, in my opinion, it is absolutely important - it is not just necessary to take care of and deal with intercepting this type of criticality, therefore of dependence and bringing people rightly on a condition of dependence on a condition of freedom, therefore of independence, but we must go upstream, Factors that lead to this type of dependence and understand and imagine that there are 166 young boys who unfortunately fall into the spiral, this only as regards dependencies, must make us reflect on the dangers of modern society, which in many parts define itself as open, is defined as more inclusive, more tolerant, freer and anything else, but then in reality we look at the data and we realize that there is often an underground malaise, which certainly should not be ignored. I thank you for your reply and obviously we will analyze in more detail what she replied."
48011,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,5302,"Let's start by answering the questions: 1) what is the current state of the works concerning the realization of the G3 body of expansion of the technological plants; 2) To what complications the accumulated delay is due to reach almost a year from the announced start of the works of the realization of the G3 body. It is first of all important to highlight that, while the work in this classroom in the previous sessions was partially concentrated in providing correct responses to concerns compared to hospital parking for bicycles or momentary inconveniences caused in via Guido Rey for the construction of the community house, an inspection took place in the construction site area between the Usl and SIV company to close the overall delivery process of the construction site areas which is then concretized by the USL to SIV on 13 November last. The theme of the hospital, and therefore also of the financing of the G3 body of the technological plants, was at the center, as among other things referred to last council, of an important and profitable meeting in which I participated with the managers of the Department at the Ministry of Health on November 12th. On this occasion, we learned favorably, by the Ministry, that our region is among the best in Italy for the expense capacity of the state funding provided in the investment account, therefore for the object of the funding of this initiative. More precisely, the Aosta Valley has completed over 80% of the financing lines for about 68 million and for the remaining part 20 million, for about 17 million, is under construction. The works for the construction of the G3 body were started last spring and in particular concerned the construction of the new gas line, the location of a new reduction cabin close to via Chaligne at the service of the hospital, the construction of some plant works inside the existing rooms used for technological plants, aimed at being able to re -establish the new gas reduction group, the construction of a embankment, therefore accumulation of soil and artificially made soil and artificial functional to the maintenance of exodus and safety paths of the hospital, coordination with the activities of other companies operating simultaneously for work in progress in the hospital garrison. As we have already reported in response to questions on the same topic, the construction of the technological plants have first of all required to proceed with some interventions on the technological networks insistent on the area of ​​interest. Some technical changes were therefore made from the design point of view with the aim of maximizing the productivity of the works and recovering the time dedicated to the transfer of users. In light of what is illustrated, we therefore confirm that the construction of the G3 body construction since their start last spring have never undergone administrative interruptions. Coming to the question n. 3 ""As consequences on the financiality of part of the interventions, to apply to the PNRR resources, can be determined in the face of the accumulated delay"", in recalling what is illustrated, there are currently no delay forecasts in carrying out the works with respect to the overall chronoprogram. As for the sources of financing - and I believe that you will be particularly happy because it avoids any type of comment on the reply - it is important to inform that during the months spent on the intervention in question, a remodeling has intervened. As is known, the intervention of the total expenditure, quantified in Euro 6 and a half million, provided for the co -financing by the European Union for Euro 2,763,013 as part of the PNRR entitled ""towards a new safe and sustainable hospital. PNC 6 health mission"". Subsequently, the decree -law 19/2024 ordered that the investments intended for the realization of the program called ""towards a safe and sustainable hospital"" -already financed by the PNC, therefore complementary to the PNRR -, with the exception of those of the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano and the Campania Region, are all responsible for the financing referred to in article 20 of law 67/1988. In fact, this rule therefore provided for a different financing path than what had been initially defined and no longer connected to the PNRR funds, but placed directly against the State. This theme has also been the subject of wide comparison and confirmed on the occasion of the meeting that we carried out with the representatives of the Ministry of Health on November 12th. The competent structure of the Department has therefore already started, in the face of numerous interlocations with the ministerial representatives, the remodeling of the loan and the preparation of the documents for signing with the state of the program agreement which will replace the documents that originally connected the funding to the PNRR and PNC funds. For the third time I repeat that this, among other things, was one of the topics covered during the meeting of 12 November last and one of the main reasons why the undersigned was present."

I was not aware of it and therefore I don't know well, maybe I will ask him next time, if this will certainly also involve an extension of the times for the realization. I remember that 330 days have almost passed, therefore over 60% of the time scheduled for the realization of the work, but so far, that I know, a hit of the pickaxe has not yet been carried out in that area, if not precisely the movement of the gas as we had seen this spring last. There will be many works in that area, I remember that the external walls will be demolished, the protections, the sidewalks will be occupied, a excavation will be made for the medium voltage line, if I understand correctly, that it will reach the concierge I imagine, but here we have not yet had any prospectus, no elaborate. The works are long, we did not understand absolutely what the causes of this delay of over a year are, she was fast, I will kindly ask her a copy of her intervention, because I was unable to follow her with particular attention, but what was the cause of this delay due, as she says, to a generic intervention on technological networks, it would be good to understand it. In any case, thank you for the reply, I kindly ask you a copy of the text of her reply and we will be with our eyes well open on this construction site."

Second question: ""If it has been foreseen to extend the time of the maximum daily parking limit for employees of the USL company in possession of a monthly subscription at the Parini car park"". The 12 -hour working hours of the staff, initially provided by the USL company at the level of experimentation, is spreading more and more by virtue of the satisfaction shown by the operators and the good result of the monitoring indicators. Therefore, considering the excellent success of the experimentation put in place, the company has communicated that it is available to deepen the contents of the agreement with the Aosta Services company, the APS, in order to provide for an extension of the current maximum daily parking limit."

As we briefly summarized in the question and as she rightly recognized, the 12 -hour turn that was initially little used now is increasingly used, it is increasingly resorted to the 12 -hour shift and what happens? It happens that obviously the stop is 12 hours, but exactly 12 hours, therefore, since the stop is 12 hours, if I do a 12 -hour turn, evidently I will arrive in the parking lot first, then I will have to dress, then I will arrive a little earlier, inside the parking lot I will have to make the dress, after which I will fear my 12 hours and then I will have to go to the parking lot, so surely in this half hour or an hour is unfortunately an extra hour. It is therefore clear that giving the possibility to those who have a subscription to expand the 12 hours, therefore making a reasoning that inserts a wider parking within the subscription is certainly something that goes in the direction of promoting the health personnel of our hospital structure. I therefore thank you for your reply and I hope that results in this sense can be had shortly."
48013,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,2,9731,"Before answering the interrogation questions, we believe it is necessary to briefly summarize the path we followed, which, according to the results obtained, reassures us and allows us to argue that we are following the best possible way as regards the object of this question. In fact, we believe above all important to remember that in the regional territory, in addition to the Umberto Parini hospital, there is only one other hospital structure: the ISAV, more commonly known as the Saint-Pierre clinic. This structure, as an accredited private hospital, entertains collaborations with the USL company focused for several years exclusively in the orthopedic sphere, also due to its mono professional nature. The agreement between the USL and ISAV company was therefore concentrated exclusively in the field of orthopedic surgery, both in an outpatient regime and in ordinary hospitalization, and in orthopedic and neurological rehabilitation services. More recently we have encouraged collaborations also in the field of long -term care, not only orthopedic and in day surgery, that is, simple surgical interventions that resolve during the day or with a maximum of overnight stay. It is important to note that the result that derives from the collaboration in the context of long-term care, a type of service, typical activity of the Saint-Pierre clinic, is of fundamental importance for all regional health. Thanks to the agreement on this service, in fact the USL company has twenty beds it uses in order to resign from the Parini hospital and the Beauregard in more quick times, thus contributing to the disposal of the famous patients' flows that are waiting for a hospitalization from the emergency room. The long -term care service at ISAV therefore helps to provide the best possible answers to taking charge of chronicity together with the other intermediate residence structures already present in the area, such as Variney and Perloz. In order to enhance the disposal of the waiting lists, at the end of the year 2023 we adopted a specific regional rule, introduced with the regional law 27/2023, which, among other things, gave ISAV the possibility of instead carrying out general surgery also under the ordinary hospitalization regime, as never happened before, thanks to the demanding work done together with the offices. The general surgery interventions in ordinary hospitalization were therefore started from September 2024 following the conclusion of the administrative proceedings for the issue of authorization and accreditation. Coming to the question n. 1 ""The number of interventions carried out in the year 2024 by the private hospital healthcare facilities in the agreement, divided by type of intervention"", as we have already explained, the only accredited private hospital with which the USL company entertains conventional relationships is precisely the Saint-Pierre clinic. The number of interventions performed during 2024 at the Saint-Pierre structure is as follows: orthopedic surgery interventions, both under hospitalization, and outpatient surgery, 358, given to the period from January to July 2024; General surgery 177 interventions, of which 149 in Day Surgery, therefore simpler, with the maximum of a night of overnight stay in the period from January-October 2024 and 28 in ordinary regime, therefore of general surgery, which can naturally be taken into consideration in the September-October 2024 period given that the general surgery applied to ISAV has started in September 2024. Coming to the application n. 2 ""The costs in agreement referring to the various interventions"", the conventions between the USL and ISAV company as regards the costs refer to the regional provisions referred to in the resolution of the junta 427 of 2013 with which the general tariff was approved for the services of hospitalization. The regional resolution detailed the cost of each homogeneous grouping of diagnosis which therefore represents the unit of measurement of the overall cost of each type of intervention. The resolution also classifies the hospital structures in two classes: A and B. Isav, for its own characteristics, is part of class B, therefore to the one to which the lowest rates are applied for the fact that some services are not present in the structure, such as emergency room, resuscitation and intensive care, rather than instrumental diagnostics and 24 -hour active workshops. The conventions also provide for the measures of the reimbursement of expenses for ISAV, which ISAV itself owes to the USL company for the services carried out and guaranteed directly by the same. Examples are the management of the transfusion service rather than laboratory diagnostics. As regards orthopedic surgery, interventions were carried out from January to July 2024 for a total cost paid by the USL company equal to around 1,813,000 euros. For general surgery, from January to October in Day Surgery, therefore the simplest ones with Massimo a night of overnight stay, the expense was a total of 176,000 euros. Coming to the question n. 3 ""How many patients are currently on the waiting list compared to surgical interventions and on the list for general surgery"", according to the data communicated by the USL company, patients on the waiting list for scheduled hospitalization, in all priorities classes, on November 14, 2024 are a total of 5,388, of which 1,466 on the list for general surgery. Comparing these numbers with those of patients waiting for intervention at the end of the year 2023 - who were 6,383 patients waiting for ordinary surgery, of whom 1,975 for general surgery -, we can argue that the current activities are producing their effectiveness, in fact in 12 months there are 1,000 patients waiting for less, of whom 400 less and therefore managed as regards general surgery. The current data start from the situation described at the end of 2023 and represent a scenario today which, in the meantime, from 1 January 2024, has naturally absorbed all the new flow generated during the year. Not only therefore we make comparisons between static numbers, but also by numbers that in the meantime have naturally seen the waiting lists increase during the current year. Coming to the question n. 4 ""What are the agreements provided for in agreement with respect to the eligible patients, in particular what the procedure for taking charge and the costs required of patients is"", as regards the active agreements between the USL and ISAV company, it is necessary to distinguish two different cases that involve two different procedures for taking charge of patients in the same way. The first concerns the historical conventions in the orthopedic sphere, therefore those that have always seen the relations between Parini and Isav, which provide for interventions carried out under institutional regime, that is, against the regional health service, on patients who are included in the waiting lists directly by ISAV: in this case users contact the clinic directly and access is allowed on demanding presentations. There are therefore no costs required for patients for the performance of surgical interventions, with the exception of any ticket for complex outpatient services. The second case, on the other hand, concerns the most recent conventions, activated between the USL and ISAV company, with the aim of strengthening the disposal of the waiting lists of the Parini hospital. This is the case of general surgery, both the Day Surgery regime, therefore the simplest ones, and the ordinary hospitalization regime, as well as orthopedic surgery interventions arranged directly by the Orthopedics Department of the Parini Hospital. All this, of course, is the result of the last year agreements. In this case, the contractual agreements provide that the complex structures of competence of the USL company, therefore general surgery, orthopedics and traumatology, identify the patients who will be operated in ISAV among those who are present within the waiting lists for planned surgery and who have a homogeneous grouping of diagnosis consistent with surgical activities that can be carried out at the Saint-Pierre structure. The pre-range of the USL company then contact the patients following the priority code assigned by the surgeon during the visit and with whom they were included on the waiting list: priority index A, a hospitalization within 30 days, B within 60, C within 180, D within 12 months. The patient is therefore proposed to be operated at the Saint-Pierre clinic and, in case of consent, the office requires the compilation and signing of the consent form to migration from the waiting list of the Parini hospital to the list of interventions that can be performed at ISAV. The Pre-Recourse Office therefore sends the list of patients to be paid to ISAV, through encrypted files, contacting them and carrying out all the activities necessary for surgical revaluation, the pre-range and the subsequent hospitalization. There are no costs required of patients and therefore, in this sense, the activity carried out at the Saint-Pierre clinic is equated with the activity in the election carried out in the hospital. In the event that the patient prefers to be operated at the Parini Hospital he will remain on the waiting list and will always be called according to his priority class as soon as there is an available place."

What I wonder is: who decides the priorities? Because, seeing the transmission and seeing the documentation carried, there was an absolute priority because this gentleman had already been waiting for over a year, after which I wonder how it is possible that all the things you have highlighted today in the interpellation do not be said when the patient calls the department or calls who duty. It can be clearly told that he is waiting and not scare him by saying: ""You will have a year in front of you before an intervention"" If with a high priority there are 30 days, but therefore we say: ""You will have 30 days and you will not have to pay anything"". This must be told to the user, because then what happens in the next piece is very interesting, because, as you said, we do not live in Lombardy or in other regions where there may be a sort of doubt about what the clinic is to which this gentleman has turned, because there is a one, therefore, from this point of view, it was rather evident that it was turning to the clinical one. Then I wonder how it is possible that, if a private individual calls, there is a sort of bargaining, when, as I tell you, the resolution you have made with the agreement is very clear and she today has also explicit all the money that are given precisely for that agreement and, from this point of view, the patient was very well in the eligible patients. So I wonder who defines the priorities and at this point I ask you then even if it can make me have the answer given the complexity of what he told me and above all because the people of the possible path that they have to follow are not informed, because I imagine that if a person is said to her: ""But you are in high priority, so you have 30 days"", he already waited for 12 months, wait 30 days did not change his life. Evidently this information - and there is also the piece of the phone call in surgery - has not been represented in any way, therefore evidently there is a lack of communication, which must be in some way explicit to citizens to avoid things of this type. I hope it does not see this interpellation as one of the pleasant passages of the regional council, where almost all interpellations are aimed at her; Most likely because there is a big problem and there are many people who continue to call us, as you imagine, to try to report what is happening in the Aosta Valley, which has never happened and on which I always want to clarify education and healthcare have been the flagship of our region, above all because it is the pensioner without great resources, and the person with many resources could still access services in the same way, today it is no longer so and it must be done. Most likely there is a real lack of communication and above all I also expected a stance compared to an interview that ended up on a national head, because of that thing we certainly did not make a good impression, because the report also came from outside Valle d'Aosta to me, so I point out that we are certainly not making a good impression even outside."

D'Aosta of prostate cancer screening to intercept any neoplasms in the population of the most risk of the initial stage. The USL company, on November 4, 2024, found the request of the Department made following the approval of the aforementioned agenda. In his report, the company specified the following. In the first place, he reported that at the moment only a region, Lombardy, has provided for the start of a prostate screening programming regarding that age group, an experience, however, not yet started, seems to start in November 2024, having as the only target the subjects born in 1974 and thus providing for a progressive extension to the rest of the male population aged between 50 and 69 years. Obviously those who were born in 1974 in 2024 turned or will turn fifty years. Lombardy was subsequently received by a preliminary phase, in which a retrospective study of the Health Protection Agency, ATS of Milan, from 2018 to 2023, a pilot project, a questionnaire for access to the screening of the prostate, working groups - were organized - we remember the one concerning the minimum technological requirements, that is, the acquisition and referration of the magnetic resonance tests - Operating protocol. The company explains that experiments in this area of ​​oncological prevention are extremely rare for various reasons. First of all, clinicians show that screening based on specific prostate antigen, the so -called ""psa"", remains controversial due to the high oversteen rate and therefore subsequent overduction that make the relationship between desired and unwanted effects of early diagnosis unfavorable not being the specific psa of cancer cells. For example, it is possible to detect high prostate antigen values ​​in cases of hypertrophy or infection without the presence of neoplasms. In fact, the problem is correctly evaluating a possible positive result as a high PSA does not mean demonstrating the presence of a tumor, nor that it is more or less aggressive or that it is necessary to operate: it only means that the positive person to the test deserves further investigations to be able to reach a correct diagnostic-therapeutic decision. Recently it has been introduced, as a complement of investigation - and is mentioned in the screening protocol for the Lombard prostate cancer in case at risk for high psa -, a periodic urological visit and a specific instrumental examination, i.e. parametric magnetic resonance imaging that should be repeated annually. The USL company, following an evaluation of its clinicians, namely the screening representatives, urologists and radiologists, therefore confirms all doubts related to such a methodology that uses a specific antigen. Clinicians claim that it would be desirable to wait for a targeted examination that has the characteristics of contributing to early diagnosis with a smaller number of false positives and/or negative, thus allowing you to treat patients first and better. I also report what recently declared by Professor Francesco Montorsi, full professor of Urology at the Vita Salute University of San Raffaele in Milan, who said: ""The theme is delicate, it has to keep in mind that, in the face of a positive result of PSA, it is not obvious that there is a tumor and that care are not always necessary and it must always be evaluated what is better for each patient, for each health service, remaining firm in the perspective of avoiding interventions. necessary "". At the moment we therefore believe that, in light of the assessments carried out by our clinicians, it is appropriate to remain informed carefully about the results of the experimentation of Lombardy and above all on a project under the national center for the prevention and control of diseases, the CCM 2023, financed by the Ministry of Health, which is entitled ""Evalibility of the feasibility of programs organized on the screening of the prostate and their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriate the use of the PSA test in the PSA test in the PSA test in the PSA test in Italian context ""and which lasts two years, with partner: the Institute for study, prevention and the oncological network, therefore the ispro, the USL Toscana Centro TC company, the reference center for epidemiology and oncological prevention in Piedmont (the CPO), the ATS Pavia, the Lombardy Region, the Institute of Pharmacological Research Mario Negri in Milan, the USL IRCCS company of Reggio Emilia, The USL of Modena and the Puglia Region. The CCM project will carry out an assessment of feasibility and opportunities for the implementation of programs organized on the screening of the prostate and an evaluation of their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriateness of the use of the PSA test in the Italian context. The CCM 2023 project will also give the possibility of developing a new generation of pilot studies on the screening of the prostate and active surveillance studies of low degree tumors that will be implemented after the project. This project was presented at the meeting of the board of the National Screening Observatory of 8 November 2024"

In this regard, first of all I would ask you if it is possible to have a copy of what has read us, because, being a strongly technical topic, it also becomes difficult to grasp the details on the fly during the illustration of the theme. From a political point of view, we appreciate the initiative that Lombardy has put in place because first of all it is an action of prevention and awareness on the subject, a topic that touches many people of the male gender and, as has been recommended by the European Union, we believe it is important to enhance these screenings. It is a very widespread question throughout the country, in 2023 there were 41,100 diagnosis, in 2022 8,200 deaths, is the first cause of death from cancer in the male population. Therefore, from what we have heard, it emerges that it would not be appropriate to go in this direction in this direction because this screening activity would lead to highlighting a series of false positives that would then increase difficulties and would give load to the local health company for the insights that instead are probably linked to inflammation or other pathologies. We believe that saving a life is important and therefore also on the screening, the risk of having situations in evidence of false positivity should also be taken, which can then be faced with further insights, because many lives could be saved through an early taking of the problem from a health point of view. We will look carefully at this topic because it is a topic that is close to our heart and we would not want us to get the last in Italy, even if at this moment this activity has only been activated by the Lombardy Region, which I believe that it has done all the appropriate assessments, even from a scientific point of view, because above all in a reality of that dimension, which is much larger than ours, would have much higher reverberations than you have described at our reality, It is a smaller reality that could also be, under certain profiles, to behave differently because there are situations that can be better managed on small numbers."

The USL company has in fact informed that, following a specific inspection, the reference spaces for the service have been identified and made available and that some adjustments of the premises are currently being defined, as required by the company's prevention and protection service. More precisely, two separate rooms were made available: one for the rescuer driver, one for the doctor, men and women. One of the two premises is currently used by the service of the company veterinarians and the head of the territorial emergency, the Dr. Cavoretto that we thank, informed that they had found maximum collaboration by the contact person of the veterinary services, the Dr. accountants, whom we thank in turn, who immediately made themselves available to reorganize the spaces for their services. They also informed that the Verrès rescue volunteers, in the sign of collaboration, gave maximum availability by making available spaces dedicated to the car available. As we have already reported, we remind you that in recent months the territorial emergency/urgency services have been the subject of an overall reorganization precisely starting from the success of the strengthening of helicopter rescue activities also in night outputs. In this sense, we remind you that our secondary helicopter and transport services in helicopter also intervene on the border areas on the Piedmontese territory with destination towards hospitals in the same region. We also remind you that this topic was, among other things, the subject of a large and profitable comparison with the Councilor for Health of the Piedmont Region on the occasion of the meeting that took place on 10 September in institutional form. By reason of the overall reorganization of services in the area and the new scenarios that have been created, it was therefore evaluated that the reference seat for the medical car was appropriately identified at the Verrès polyculatory. To Donnas the service is guaranteed in daytime hours by a medicalized ambulance and at night by an ambulance with emergency/urgency nurses. The location of the medical car, equipped with a rescuer and a dedicated doctor at the Verrès polycutor, who arises in equidistance between the châtillon and Donnas offices, therefore presents itself as a strategic solution aimed at guaranteeing the timeliness of the interventions over the whole area of ​​the valley floor, including the surrounding lateral valleys. The medical car, in fact, in its turn from 19:00 to 07:00, can effectively support the nursing figures present on the ambulances that are headed by Châtillon and Donnas, who, as we have said, are qualified in the skills of the emergency/urgency."

We, as a group, presented this question simply because she, councilor, had foreseen, as she remembered well, a medical car with the rescuer to Verrès, but to date there is no reference, I refer to the interpellation of 19 June no. 3744, where you, in response to my initiative, replied: ""From next July, at the Verrès polyculatory, a medical car will currently be permanently active with the driver, rescuer and a dedicated doctor"". Obviously, as I could see, this medical car is not there. Therefore taking into account the will of its Department of guaranteeing effective assistance and urgency in the low valley, it seems necessary to remember it. She talked about the efficiency of the helicopter, which we share. To remain on the topic, I would like to highlight the need for users of the low valley to create, in addition to the community hospital, also a first aid point, indispensable for a first intervention. We have repeatedly highlighted it in this advice and the colleague also highlighted it perhaps two weeks ago, so I would like to highlight it too. Finally, I remember that voluntary associations, important figures in managing the emergency/urgency, work in close collaboration with the Healthcare Company, guaranteeing a first aid service throughout the regional territory, but this important service needs an efficient health network. At this point we just have to wait for the car to Verrès."

48017,XVI,21/11/2024,CREDITO,en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,3499,"Here is another piece of the puzzle that was evoked yesterday regarding depopulation, bank desertification. It is now news of more than a month ago the closure of the Etroubles banking desk, which remained the only one in the Freida Coumba and also of the closure of the Antey-Saint-André bank branch ... (intervention by a councilor outside the microphone) ... and of Brusson also says the commissioner. Then there will be the next closure of the Morgex counter; These news that are absolutely negative, especially for non -digital natives, whose number is not so small. We start from an assumption: that these banking institutions are not public bodies, therefore on the one hand they rightly make their choices, their autonomy, however, often clashes with the needs of citizens, at least in different municipalities, which perhaps do not have such a large population, which, once the door closed, must do dozens and even tens of kilometers to take advantage of a service. The data precisely on the so -called ""bank desertification"" are alarming. According to Uilca, Uil Credito, tax collectors and insurances, in Italy from 2018 to 2023, bank branches decreased by 20.7%, 5,248 less in five years, the municipalities served by the banks decreased by 13.4%and also the employees of the counters suffered a drop of 6%. Also according to Uilca, who carried out some interesting surveys, nine out of ten people are dissatisfied with the closure of the bank branches in their municipality and five out of ten declare that they go to a banking office at least once a month. Seven out of ten people also declare that they have warned enough or a lot of lack of a bank branch in their municipality. But why do banking institutions decide to close their doors? Essentially for three reasons: the first is the reduction of costs, so we tend to close where there is less users at the population level. Then there is the second reason that are the banking aggregations that have been made and a third reason: that of digitization, because in any case the Internet Banking is increasingly used. However, these reasoning on citizens' skin cannot be made. By focusing in a slightly more direct way on the Aosta Valley, we have 40 thousand Aosta Valleys that reside in municipalities that do not record the presence of any bank on their territory; Over a third of the Aosta Valley, which has been deprived of access to bank branches from 2015 to today, therefore less than ten years, 18,500 Aosta Valley residing in municipalities that have only one bank counter and 68% of the Valle d'Aosta municipalities that do not have bank branches on their territory. These are data from the CISL bank desertification observatory. Precisely because banking institutions are not public bodies, the maneuvering space is limited, but I believe that an attempt at least to understand the reasons why these bank branches are closed is absolutely necessary. He therefore wonders with this initiative, as well as a series of even more recent data, if there is the desire to start a comparison table together with the mayors, the consumer associations, with the managers of the credit institutions to somehow understand their motivations of the closure of these banking institutions in the area and also understand what the tools with which to maintain open ones can be and, if necessary, encourage the birth of new ones."
48017,XVI,21/11/2024,CREDITO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,7389,"The requests of colleague Lavy concern what is the current number of banking branches and ATMs on the regional territory and how many banking branches and ATMs have been closed in the last three years and in which municipalities. As regards the statistical data of the annual report 2024 on the regional economy of the Bank of Italy, it is obtained that in 2013 fifteen banks were present in the valley, in 2022 fourteen and thirteen banks in 2023. As for the counters, instead the numbers are as follows: in 2013 the bank branches on the regional territory were ninety -nine, in 2022 they had descended to sixty -eight and in 2023 at sixty -seven. The bank branches currently present in Valle d'Aosta, as per information provided by the Bank of Italy branch, are sixty -five, the ATMs are one hundred and thirty -seven, the last available figure of 2023. As regards the closures, in 2021 the doors were sixty -eight, so there were three closures: one in Aosta, one a issogne and one in Etroubles, while the number of ATMs in 2023, One hundred and thirty -seven, it is the same as that of 2021. This decrease in the number of branches is also slightly better, but in line with the overall Italian data, which sees the bank branches decrease from 31,761 of 2013 to 20.161 of 2023. The Bank of Italy report then photographs another figure, that is, that the municipalities served by banks were in the Aosta Valley Trentaquattro in 2013 and twenty -four in 2023, inflicted by the small numbers of our reality, but in line with the trend of Italy that sees the municipalities served by banks passed by 5,846 in 2013 at 4,651 in 2023. The report of the Bank of Italy then also provides data of the opposite sign, as you can imagine. The home banking services, as also partially reported in the assessment of the councilor, to families out of 100 inhabitants in Valle d'Aosta go from 45.2% in 2013 to 78.3% in 2023 and online transfers reached 88.8% of the total and were less than 54% in 2013. Of the opposite sign, the data on the Bancoposta branches, which passed from fifty -seven in 2013 to sixty -six in 2023, are also the figure. to what happened throughout Italy. Meanwhile, I thank the branch of the Bank of Italy of Aosta, in particular the deputy chief Dr. Paolo Emilio Mistrali, who allowed us to analyze these data and made us available to updates to respond in the most punctual way possible. As for the third question, however: ""If there is the intention, together with the mayors and associations of consumers, to start a comparison table with the managers of the credit institutions to avoid the closure of banking branches and ATMs"", in the annual report since 2023 Banca di Italy has dedicated a specific study to this topic, highlighting how between 2015 and 2022 the number of bank counters, in relation to the residents, is reduced by the residents, 27%, in line with what happened throughout the Eurozone and not only in Italy, referring to this in -depth analysis, available on the Bank of Italy website for other data, such as, for example, the presence of the postal counters, which make sure that the number of Valley Municipalities, without any banking service, descends to nine. However, it seems important to me, in relation to the third question, to indicate that the decrease in bank branches is traced back to the search for efficiency of the operators, to which the effects of technological innovations and new payment habits have been added. In summary, not only in the Aosta Valley but throughout Europe the territorial network of the banks has been reduced and it could also be said that the banking sector is the latest arrival if you think about the progressive decrease or closure that began over twenty years ago of the territorial offices and other services of general interest such as telephony, gas or other state and public order services. This said, also from direct experience, the interlocutions on the presence of counters in the area and a comparison that discounts wide -ranging corporate policies with multinationals that have no roots in the area and with which the opportunities for comparison are very limited, if not non -existent administrations. We also add a strong implementation of the equipment for electronic payments, which now affect almost all of the economic, tourist and commercial realities of ours, like other territories, which over time have reduced the intermediation function of banks, as well as the increasingly specialist functions of the same, which dedicate specialized personnel to the various categories of customers; Customers who in most cases are reached at their activities or residences or followed by appointment flexiblely, also reducing in this case the need for a widespread territorial office. Then there are actions of the institutes that seek efficiency, this often means simply reduction in costs in the face of an implementation of standardized services. In this sense, the activity of the Region and institutions towards credit institutions also aims to create payment methods and procedures that facilitate distance services, with the use of special applications and operating methods that can be implemented by mobile banking, which can neutralize the drop in classic territorial services. What we can do and that we have always done in the Aosta Valley is instead implemented a series of actions necessary to keep alive, inhabited the whole territory and, consequently, interesting for operators and service providers such as banking ones. In good synthesis, I believe that the opportunities that are already implemented and the requests that are advanced periodically by the Municipalities, together with the Region, but mainly by the Municipalities, which, once they had a little sharper weapons in order to encourage credit institutions to position a counter or an ATM on their territory, mainly linked to treasury services, which gave banks to enter the fabric, even socio-economic, Thus grabbing a part of customers ... Today these mechanisms are overcome by other technologies and other innovations and also these opportunities, which were available to the municipalities, with their resources and with their possibility of making a service to the community through a banking desk, come to fade. The contact is always there, there is however and is evidently à la Ue, especially by the local authorities, but actually the change of habits must also lead us to work more on those that can be concessions, including preparation for those who have to re -read their system to the evolution of the services offered by the banking system. This goes a little with a view to what the regional administration is also doing to try to insert a whole series of opportunities in the banking circuits, also of direct relationship with the administration, as regards, for example, payments or other situations that can directly touch the context of the regional administration in particular."

Having bank branches means having a service in the area. Now she has started saying that the world rightly goes on, there is an innovation, there is also a change of habits and that therefore in the end we are in trend with the national level, we are in trend even at European level, then those who care if they close a little bank branches, so it goes on, it doesn't matter. The Internet Banking is increasing and it would be interesting to understand if the percentage of increasing people who use the Internet Banking is a will or an obligation, because it is obvious that if they close bank branches in the freidal couma, it is normal that then users should somehow learn to use other systems if they do not want to remain dry. She said: we went from ninety -nine branches to sixty -five in about 10 years. So, if I am a service, it is an account, if I am not a service, she said, even in the perspective of cost savings, we do this ... (intervention of a councilor outside the microphone) ... not the region, because obviously the region in this case has nothing to do with it, but we invite the banking institutions, in the name of savings, to close all the branches of the valley, we only make the banks in Aosta and we are all happy if the speech is the speech. Then he said another interesting thing: that today the comparison with the banking institutions is non -existent, but with this initiative he wonders if there is the desire to establish a table, precisely to ensure that this comparison can be born. No, it is not good, it makes no sense to carry on this speech, when instead, for example, the Liguria Region, and also other regions, have established real observers on the issue of bank desertification. Now that then they can have more or less positive effects of impact on avoiding closing is another matter, but a minimum of more attention is there. Here you pretend nothing, that everything goes well, but yes, in the meantime you go on, the technology goes on, the innovation goes on, those who care if the inhabitants of Brusson in the Freida Coumba of Antey have one counter less, so much so you have to go on in the face of those who maybe have to remain in those municipalities there and do not have the possibility, because of the age or because of many situations, to have access to the Internet Banking. Honestly, I would say to me make peace with the brain, yesterday you say one thing on the maintenance of the services, today that a system is proposed for some way I do not say to block, but having a concertation with the institutes that give the services this is not good, it is useless. Really and honestly I have no words."

We found that from the published news it seems that there are only five public toilets for an area of ​​about 35 kilometers. We remain that the numerous excellence and historical-cultural beauties present in Aosta have always been important strengths relating to the tourist offer of the Aosta Valley and, in particular, precisely within the regional capital for years, various important events have also been organized, also in collaboration with the involvement and support of the regional administration. Taking into account that, despite the territorial jurisdiction, therefore also the planning and realization of the various services is borne by the Municipality of Aosta, however, we believe that it is appropriate, for the reasons indicated in the premises, that the competent regional departments can commit to verifying the presence or absence of this critical issues in the area and, if necessary, may request greater attention and collaboration to the Municipality of Aosta, with the aim of being able to offer a better quality of the general services offered by our well -known regional residence. The competent councilors are therefore asked to know if they are aware of such news and if the statements reported correspond to reality. If in the case of affirmative answer to the first question, there is the intention of interning in a proactive way with the municipal administration of Aosta to try to improve the overall offer of the services present in the territory of the capital."

Beat separately, I confess that I was not aware of the printing news to which the interpellating refers, so I am not able to say if the information corresponds to reality. However, the interpellation correctly anticipates it: the question is not exactly the responsibility of the regional administration. I do not want to resize the importance from the point of view of the tourist usability of the regional capital, but it should be noted, for example, that, on the occasion of the event or events supported or sponsored by the regional administration, the placement of chemical bathrooms is one of the organizational and economic aspects, also in the proper sense of support of expenditure, significant, attention and planned with attention. For the rest, the Municipalities are not subject to protection or address by the Region, but I am sure that those who have to have taken note of the same press considerations that you have seen and take on the determinations of competence. As regards the interlocution of the Departments, which time in time collaborate with the administration of the capital, I can guarantee that the taking charge of the overall logistics is taken by the organization of the various events, which evidently goes to size, in many cases also for issues, even before anything else, of safety, the various services useful for the best use of the event. The interlocution between the municipal and regional structures, each for the aspects of their own competence, is however a practice obviously always followed and practiced, as well as indispensable to be able to guarantee good results and on this they are certain will be continued to work with attention and professionalism, enthusiasm and maximum collaboration between all the bodies to improve even situations that are not at the top, such as those reported by the councilor."
48018,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,4084,"I thank the president especially for the tones and the mode in response in the final part that has shown greater collaboration to however try to resolve or report these critical issues compared to the initial joke, because in any case, even if it is true - and we said it first - that the competence is municipal in the realization of the services, however, being a regional capital, a capital of interest just as the regional word says and we all know that it is the maximum point of reference and the Also historical-cultural level of our region, we have considered more than appropriate to present and above all report this criticality, as we said in a proactive way, because in any case I believe that you too have had the opportunity to access this information. It is enough to simply go to Google, therefore on the most technological tools that is also reiterated, even by the competent councilor, also how much more important the speech of the innovation to digitization is more important, therefore how important it is to have these increasingly performing tools. We have to believe it with words, but then also in the reality of the facts they must work. If you go to Google, you see that there are five icons of the services that there is open written in two, where there are three, they are three of the same bathroom and even one, for example, go to that of the station and see that it is written: ""Closed, opens on Friday morning at 06:00"", as if one needs that service from 06:00 in the morning onwards and not during the other times. This as a joke. The speech was that we referred to the competent departments because we believed that Councilor Sapinet could be, in collaboration, for example, also with the Councilor for Tourism, given the contents of the premises, but the answer on his part is very well that made a summary on the subject. The initiative was presented in early November and just a few days ago, on November 18th, as you also know, the news was released: ""Italy today: Aosta, 22th for the quality of life, the regional capital loses 13 positions and, to determine these positions, reference is made to services and infrastructures, so we are not completely out of place with the initiative, but unfortunately the criticality is there, even if it is not a complete regional competence. They concern the initiative ... if we go to see, the same topic was treated within the Aosta City Council at the end of December where with a motion the theme of the criticality and scarcity of these services that are within the regional capital and the competent councilor of a municipal majority that mostly reflects the same majority at the composition level of what we have here at the regional level, admits and says there will be a decisive intervention, was presented. A year later, we wonder if they really and concretely operated in this direction, because of course, if there are critical issues, you must also all try to solve them and this is a speech. Above all, we reiterate the discourse of the quality of services, we also mean that attention in monitoring the most modern technologies that are available to us: Google and all the apps that are available to us still today. We therefore favorably grab the last part of his response, but the invitation is precisely to do synergy so that even these critical issues, which many times are considered trivial or undertone at the end we cannot even rent chemical bathrooms every time, because in any case they are also costs. If on the one hand we manage to resolve, making services stable and well put with due financial investments, we certainly manage to improve these services for the benefit of the region, to the benefit of its image, at national and international level."
48020,XVI,21/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Autostrade e trafori alpini",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,2,6377,"It is under discussion these days - in reality the path has started in September - the annual law for the market and competition 2023; If I am not mistaken, among other things, the discussion in the commission should be finished and should land in the classroom. The first leader (because the law is still complex) should contain (obviously the law is in any case evolving) the provisions on the reorganization of motorway concessions. This law is a law that explains - and I say it clearly - what is actually the national recovery and resilience plan, because this garment contains the objectives placed by the national recovery and resilience plan to be achieved by 31 December 2024. As regards the motorway sector, a series of principles are inserted (I will try to represent those a little more central on the interpellation) which I have also already recalled in the premises. Basically, the provision that wants to bring this first garment is to define a regulatory framework for motorway concessions in which to make the course of the races mandatory. In reality, we must start again from a while, because in the report it is precisely referred to 2019, when, among the recommendations aimed at Italy, there were those of dealing with the restrictions on the competition, there was also talk of the part of the motorways and therefore define an annual competition of the competition (in reality this law is repeated every year, but it is not that it was born for a few years ago, it has been there for some time that has been talked about). Within the forecasts there are some: the first is to have a regulatory framework in which the guarantees aimed at preventing the continuation of the expired concession relationship from continuing beyond the time necessary for the performance of the tender procedure are more stringent. The discipline of the in -house assignment is then disciplined, which is actually a theme that I remember I had already partially treated with the commissioner Caveri some time ago by talking about the Autobrennero, in which, however, a theme that is that of the similar control in which the MIT would remain to act as Dominus. Then there is the theme on the works that can be entrusted and that must indeed be entrusted to third parties at least around 50-60%. Then there is one of the first particular, and perhaps more sensitive issues, which is to go to identify optimal management areas which, for the motorway sector, should have a mileage tendentially between 180 and 315 km. This derives from a model defined by the transport adjustment authority that substantially says: having to reach economies of scale of a certain type, the optimal area is what is between 180 and 315 km. If you go to see in the report of the law, we find that among all the concession reports, Edin particular for kilometer managed by the motorway network, at 19 or place we find the SAV with 67.4 km, at 23 or place the RAV, 32.4, and then respectively at 25 or and 27 or place we find the San Bernardo tunnel and the Mont Blanc tunnel. What is the peculiarity? If we add all four concessions, you reach a mileage of 119 kilometers, which obviously is clearly below the mileage identified by the concession model of the transport authority, which still makes you think. There is another principle that is defined within the law, or what concession relations, in particular contracts, should not exceed 15 years and possibly could exceed when there is a realization of the works that justifies its extension. On the theme of the duration of concessions there would be a great job, especially towards what are other European countries: there are countries that vary over 40 years, others also have a sort of perpetuity; On hydroelectric is the same thing, here we speak of 15 years within which the investment should obviously be due, with all the annexed and connected problems. We therefore ask whether the contents of the annual bill for the market and competition 2023 have been examined by the competent structures of the regional administration and, if positive, what are the considerations about the possible repercussions on the regional context. If the adopting provisions on the reorganization of the motorway concessions provided for in the already recalled bill have been the subject of evaluation or interlocution with the participatory companies SAV and RAV, as well as with the concessionary companies of the two tunnels and, if positive, with which conclusions. This above all I would say linked to two themes, that of the optimal scope and the duration of the concession relationship. If the contents of the already recalled section 4. 6 of the Regional Transport Plan (we recalled in the premises the proposals for the revision of motorway tolls on the A5 and on the Aosta Valley motorway link) already take into account the evolutions that are expected for the motorway sector in the face of the contents of the competition law and above all as actions, in the face of what has been represented and requested so far, intends to put in place the regional government to avoid the generation of potential negative externalities, seize any opportunities against the regulatory evolutions mentioned in the introduction. There is one more step to do, and so I reconnect to the theme of the regional transport plan: on the regional transport level I mentioned this section, but in reality there are also other parts, in which substantially, in summary, there is a proposal to review the tolls in a kilometer sense, where the lowering of the rates there is a consequent increase in cash flows, and therefore of the use of the highways, but it is also true that in the face of the It is working, even the tariff model should be partially changed, and if the optimal area is the one I summarized in terms of mileage and annuality, some more concerns asks it, therefore the fourth question is to actually understand if the government is reasoning above all in terms of potential negative externalities that would touch not only the user, but the whole territory of our valley."
48020,XVI,21/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Autostrade e trafori alpini",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,4,3867,"The interpellation addresses an important question that will require particular attention in the future in the application of the new legislation. Meanwhile, I believe that it is not so known to everyone that, among the objectives of the PNRR, there is also the reorganization of the regulatory framework for motorway concessions, a question that occupies much of the bill for the market and competition, as also recalls the interpellation, which should be approved by December 31 of this year. The interpellation recalls the main rules contained in the bill that are of sure interest in terms of the mandatoryity of the tender for the assignment of concessions, the optimal areas of management and the duration of the new concessions. At the moment, we have not yet activated a comparison with the dealerships of the Aosta Valley infrastructures, also because the situations are, as known, differentiated. Only for the tunnel of the Grand San Bernardo the region is a majority partner in the concessionaire company, while SAV and RAV are companies that are part of large groups and, as well as in the case of the Mont Blanc tunnel, as in that of the Gran San Bernardo, they also manage infrastructures regulated by international agreements with France and Switzerland. We then know that the competition of the competition has also led to new interlocations between the Ministry and the dealers for the conclusion of the process of approval of the economic and financial plans, some of which have expired for several years now. We then follow the process of the bill carefully and, when there will be certainty of the rules that will be approved, you can start an evaluation of the impacts and relapses on the regional context in terms of critical issues, as well as the opportunities also underlined by the interpellating. For the third question, the proposal of the Regional Transport Plan was approved by the Regional Council on 15 July last, therefore before the start of the parliamentary path of the competition bill, which began on September 26, for which it could not take into account what is contained in the latter. The Regional Transport Plan, however, hypothesizes a series of infrastructure interventions to improve the usability of the motorway infrastructure, so that this can also fully play a role of service to the Aosta Valley Community, with the improvement of the accesses that have already been the subject of interventions and inspection investigations also within this classroom, such as the accesses to Entrèves, in Courmayeur, Morgex, variants on the SR of the SR of the Gressoney valleys, Ayas, Valtournenche, the new Aosta Centro toll booth. In addition, the PRT hopes for a different tariff policy, reduction of tolls and introduction of the mileage toll (as highlighted also this morning and resumed in the illustration of the inter -apellance itself) both on RAV and possibly on SAV, in order to divert part of the traffic that today makes the transit on state 26 difficult towards the highway. From the simulations made with the modeling program of the Aosta Valley road network, it emerges how this is possible without unsustainablely penalizing the cash flow of the dealership companies of the two sections. Obviously this cannot be obtained with current concessions through an agreement with dealers or with future concessions, intervening a priori in the phase of their preparation. Upon the start of the updating activities of the regional transport plan, the offices met the various actors in the sector, including the dealers of the highways and tunnels for a comparison on the main problems existing and the contacts will continue to identify activities and initiatives of common interest downstream of what will be the provisions of norm."

I objectively and very modestly some doubts, also on the basis of some assessments, of some works that had been done in the period 2011-2012 by a commission of the competent Ministry, emerged in relation to the possibility of applying tolls in mileage, especially in the concession On the basis of what are the contents of the market law and the competition, and above all of the regulatory and tariff model of the transport authority, there is some doubts, and perhaps some more elements can be inserted or some more evaluation can be inserted within the same level or in any case of the procedure that will also be there with the presentation of observations, because surely a theme is that of economic management, the other instead is the authorization and authorization to be able to apply a model, It is much closer, since we are talking about motorways or in any case of communication routes. As far as the passage is concerned ... In fact, we talked about interlocutions or evaluations with realities in which obviously we do not have control (only in one case) and among other things the SAV is controlled by what is the second group for concessions control, so it is represented in the relationship, so it is not a subject of less interest on the national scene, it is certain that what can be the evolution, above all I say it in the subject of future new concessions, is a rebus that we will have to try Solving our side too, however of entering the game, because otherwise it would really risk passing over everyone's head and not taking into account the territories and repercussions on the territories. The theme also of the toll booths and the gratuity of some sections and even perhaps the possibility of defining the tariffs - as this morning, among other things, it also said with another initiative - could be the subject of interlocution in the context of the calls, or in any case of the new races that, in any case, always have a higher authority, which is the ministry, which we know is not a subject with which it is easy to relate, but it is necessary and you need to take in time."

During the debate in the classroom of 2 October 2024 on the bill relating to the recruitment in the Forestry Corps and in the Fire Brigade, President Testalin made offensive statements to our group after the presentation of an amendment, which wanted to allow the boys too young in 2012, because they had not turned 18, and too old today, because instead they exceeded the 26 years, to be able to participate in the competition test for the firefighters. An amendment, therefore, aimed at 4,000 young Valle d'Aosta who today, with the approved law, have lost the chance to be able to participate in the competition. At that time, compared to the amendments, the president declared this: ""I would not like these to be animated by other particular situations which, in short, are taken into consideration by someone for reasons that are not really linked to a public interest but to other situations"". And then, in replica the dose came back, saying: ""I believe that when they say things, there is someone who understands them very well, even without specifications, and it is also aware of what he does"". I want to reassure the councilor aggravation: I never go into the merits of issues where there are stresses on one side or the other, and it is so. However, since there are groups that are always very diligent to put in the square of the funambolic situations, I wanted to underline these passages precisely to make those who present special situations understand that many times, even if you do not do it with specific intentions, there may be references that return against. This is not the case with all amendments. It is right - then I can't pronounce the Neapolitan, so forgive me, I don't know if you say this -, ""CCà Nisciun è fss"", that someone who has particular situations knows that they may not even do good to the path he is carrying out. This was the meaning of my intervention. Needless to say, in these words we can find serious accusations and even I would say threats, so we have been asking for a clarification for over a month. We therefore sent two notes, one on 7 and another on October 21, respectively to the President of the Region, the Prime Minister and for knowledge to the group leaders, in which we asked again information and clarifications with respect to these statements, to protect our work and the work of all the directors. To date, as I said, no clarification has been given to us, nor any formulation of excuses, and even in the last Council the Prime Minister cut short saying that he had brought the content of the notes to the attention of the President of the Region, as if these were not also addressed to him. For this reason we ask who exactly the serious statements mentioned were addressed, what are the particular situations taken into consideration for reasons not linked to a public interest that, in his opinion, have therefore led the councilors to present the amendments to that bill, what he meant in affirming that these particular situations may also not do well to the path that is carrying on and if it is his intention to apologize to the undersigned councilors."

So, one thing is when it comes to work, other thing is when instead it is questioned that this work is linked to personal interests. She, again, understood that she was addressed to my person, but to date I have not yet understood what are the reasons that pushed him to say certain things. Honestly, I continue to believe that, from this point of view, when they make statements, then you must also have the courage to say why these are done, because we are in a classroom of a regional council, we are not in a bar of Bosses, therefore, from this point of view, most likely you have to pay well attention to what is said.

You would expect, from a regional president, another allure, but we must resign ourselves, because she does not have this allure, she will never have it. Her arrogance is palpable, and we found it even today, when she even made statements that do not correspond to the truth, responding to her colleague aggravation about a letter that she received as I received, saying that it was not true that there was a need for a response, citing only things that concerned other topics. But, what is serious is that she now turned words to colleague Guichardaz, but we both signed those of those amendments, and we feel really made fun of from what she said a little while ago; We would not have - at least I would not have - imagined that she had continued to take this path without even having humility, let's call it that, to apologize to people, because her statements - everyone can go to listen to - have been very serious in that situation. She accuses people of being here to do personal interests and not public interests and when she tried to put a piece she even worsened the situation, because she apologized, or rather, she reassured her colleague aggravation, saying that she did not turn to him, so clearly he turned to us. We also tried to understand the motivation that had led her to express itself in that way, we asked ourselves because we said: ""Who knows, perhaps there is something that may have created an incomprehension"". Among other things, and I say it because at least so we clarify all the fields, both we have children who fall within that age group and we even wondered: ""Who knows if we imagine that we want to favor someone of our children, our grandchildren"", I also have a nephew that falls within that age group, but it is not so. Instead, she continued undaunted, and continues, to support her thesis. I do not know, president, what will be of his political future, I wish you every good, but certainly I highly recommend them, if she continues to cover charges of this type, and above all this charge, which is the highest charge of this region, to start thinking that perhaps there are different systems to behave, there are different languages.

Once this free initial diagnosis has been completed, only then was it said that an evaluation and planning of what could be subsequent activities could be made. The package should also have understood the possibility of then subsequently carrying out the ""turnkey"" interventions, the execution to get to the management of the plants and the subsequent support to the necessary environmental certification and, where the conditions exist, even also to the complete financing of the initiative. On the occasion in which the regional council was then discussed, given that the initiative was in the embryonic state, following our solicitation in which the possibility of evaluating the extension of this initiative not only to the accommodation activities, but also to the entire productive activity sector, we had been answered that, once the first diagnosis and also the interlocutions with all the trade associations would be completed, there would have been the necessary elements to make a joint assessment with the company aside. of politics, to understand what were the various offers proposed that could be concretized. Having said that, therefore, we have reported the topic of the Council today and, in particular, we ask how many are the premature energy diagnosis studies that have been performed, on which categories of properties and if for these studies local freelancers have been involved, with a view to promoting participation in these initiatives of those who work in the Aosta Valley market. Subsequently, if they have been, how many contracts stipulated, that is, those who have been concretized and successful, which will lead to the realization of the interventions. Finally, what are the interlocutions that were made with the production fabric, what are the offers of intervention that developed and, at the conclusion, the intentions of the regional government regarding the above initiative."

The specific know-how required is the typical one of the Energy Service Company's SOCY, so it was opted to use internal resources to the CVA group and therefore it was decided not to turn to free local professionals. How many contracts entered into as a result of pre -amal studies and for which total amount, if the works of efficiency to local businesses will be entrusted: as regards the second application, CVA announces that no contract has yet been stipulated as an inspection and pre -approaching study activities, in particular on the regard of the efficiency works. During a specific meeting, at the Chambre Valdôtaine, held on February 8, 2024, the involvement of local businesses was urged, giving them the opportunity to apply on the portals of the CVA group. Point 3, as a result of the interlocutions with the productive fabric, what are the intervention offers developed in the various areas: as regards this point, CVA specifies that during the meetings with the Chambre Valdôtaine, the hoteliers and Valdostan tourist companies, the Green Energy Hospitality program was discussed. This program provides various possibilities of intervention for hotel structures: the renovation of roofs and insulation, replacement of summer air conditioning system, photovoltaic system installation with storage system, external and internal lighting, installations of charging columns, replacement of ventilation and heating systems, replacement of heating terminals, replacement of hot water reduction system, replacement of external windows, isolation or renovation or thermal insulation, automation. the control of the plants. With regard to the last question, the regional structures deputy will continue to follow, as far as competence, the evolution and development of the proposed initiative."

The questions we asked in this interpellation had the purpose of understanding what the extension of this initiative was at all production sectors, as we had already talked about it when we presented last interpellation. Then it had been said that politics and society would be jointly defined what the platform of the possible beneficiaries of this initiative was, because here it is a political choice and not of technical choice. It seems to me that in this respect of the forward steps have not been made of it, because the will of a political expression on this initiative has not yet emerged from his words and has still stopped at the evaluation of the intervention on possible accommodation facilities. As well as the aspect of the involvement of the associations: she recalled today, as she had recalled last time the topic was, of the meetings that were held at the Chambre; I can assure you, because I have verified, both CNA and Confartigianato expressed their availability, indeed, their interest in this type of initiative, but they no longer had any involvement compared to this topic from the only meeting they had. Therefore, we who are also very close to productive activities, the development of the local productive fabric, we can say that from a certain point of view we are a little worried, because on the one hand there has been no involvement of all those who are the professionals qualified locally to carry out this type of activity, on the other hand we are equally concerned because, if I understood well, the possible involvement of the local companies would pass through the Supply Summer. on the CVA platform. We believe that the development of local crafts, of the construction sector, the plant engineer, those who work on the properties passes through direct involvement and not through subcontracting initiatives. Our companies, public companies, in our humble opinion, should deal - always on this topic - of the part in which the other actors are unable to be able to intervene. Perhaps it is necessary to draw what is the spirit of the initiative and its strategic potential, but then, afterwards, do not incorporate the part of the construction inside because otherwise we can suffocate the growth of the local production system, which is already a production system that finds great difficulties in being able to operate and be able to grow. It is a productive sector, the one in the context of the buildings, which cannot go to break through beyond its borders, which are the Aosta Valley ones, and if we even put it in difficulty in operating in the Aosta Valley I believe that it restores it strongly in perspective. On this we believe that politics should make a fair reflection, because we believe that the public administration and its joints must limit, at the operational level, to the minimum essential and then act as facilitators to the development of the company, and not to occupy all the spaces of the economic fabric, because, otherwise, in perspective, difficult conditions of permanence would be determined in the market by operators. Having said that, we believe that the topic is an extremely important topic, on which we will return, because in our opinion it must be the policy that decides on which type of structures to intervene, because it is right that all production activities can benefit from the same initiative, because all contribute to the achievement of the Fossil Fuel Free objectives, of decarbonisation and therefore improvement of environmental qualities to contribute to the energy transition."
48023,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Politiche giovanili",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,7667,"With this initiative we return to what is the theme we have dealt with several times within this classroom, the last time also with the President of the Region, which I thank for having expressed solidarity with the people attacked at the Citadel. We return because obviously that aggression has substantially raised a whole other series of critical issues. We have always denounced that the citadel was unfortunately gradually having a politicization and had become a land of hunts and conquest of people who felt politically legitimate to be able to make propaganda within that structure and we had always been answered a little with enough, with superficiality, in reality then we saw what they were. In the face of this, it must be said that we have taken note of some recent initiatives a little, we could make a little a manual of what are the obviously political initiatives inside the citadel, in which, however, I still remember with dismay that the then mayor of Aosta, Centoz, prevented me from presenting a book, which was moreover a novel, because it could not be: woe to present a book in Cittadella! For another other series of initiatives, however, that can be. It was not a political novel, it did not concern anything politician, but it could not be, at the time. I also remember that I really took away from Imperio ... I had booked the room in time, with all the trappings, he took away the room, just him, as mayor, of imperial. So we remember the democratic era of the ""Piddino"" government of the Municipality of Aosta a bit. In the face of this, however, what we have detected is a list of initiatives ... We know very well, she knows, councilor, as much as I know, that there is a co -management, indeed no, there is a loan from the region and a management by the Municipality, which made its own small consent hunting reserve (let's call it that), making a little live the cooperatives, a little in charge of here, we know. However, what we have noted is that even by the regional part, unfortunately, we go in the direction of financed and supporting projects that always go in the usual direction and we have also taken note of it recently, with what was a bit the initiative and with what was a bit the news that made known the Department of Financing some regional calls for what I will never reduce me to call with the name they gave him, who is part of the abbreviation. I will always call Cittadella of young people. Cittadella's initiatives have a distinctive stretch. To an unhappy observer, they could actually seem cultural initiatives in themselves, but what I would like to understand is that unfortunately we always have to do with the usual political matrix and above all with projects that have boundaries that are not well defined, there are other initiatives - I will obviously bring them to the next council sessions - which leave very large margins, unfortunately, to a evident political exploitation. Now, what is the question? That it can be said to me that that or that other party do not make initiatives in the citadel, and this obviously is there, and we know it, but it is not only the party problem, it is precisely the problem that, in the form of cultural initiatives, a series of initiatives attributable, in one way or in another, are sponsored, both to themes very dear to a certain well -defined political part, both to subjects who make their own political activism. I will give you a small summary: I read the press release he made, we have for example in the two calls to the cultural initiatives for the youngest (130 thousand euros), in which we find the ""Black History Month Valle d'Aosta"", therefore the multidisciplinary festival on the history of color people, however organized by an association which is part of some subjects who took care of being in the group when the aggression is unleashed, we say. Like this; So we already have something that, objectively, with the purposes and with the statute of the Citadel have nothing to do with it and which, moreover, is part of an association that was in the tussle that broke out in the citadel. Then we have ""voices of the other world"", an participatory artistic laboratory, with a theater company: here too a very large program, but above all the subject is the same that presented for example the anti -violence projects that, in reality, devoted themselves to gender policies (we talked about it today); So we always have very labile and politicizable boundaries, poorly defined purposes, but clear matrix. Furthermore, the ""Urban Contaminations"" project (moreover we also talked about this this morning), which sees the participation of the same teacher who at the University of Valle d'Aosta offers gender courses, would like to propose gender courses, I hope the Board of Directors blocks this thing; So we have this question of urban contaminations. Among other things, if we go to see the organizing subjects on the social profile, we find the usual flood of asterisks, ""respect, good morning, graz, prayers"" and things that usually said Cattivik when I read the comic books of Cattivik when I was more boy. Still the ""Growing +"" project, I say it in Italian, so we do not say the obscene name that was given to the Citadel, with more vision, participatory, interactive meetings, open to the public, with thematic discussions, I imagine what these thematic discussions can focus on, moreover presented by a nice red cooperative. To all this, if not enough, we add the initiatives on immigration and similar, which we have remembered well within this classroom. The citadel is used as a starting point, arrival for various events including Gay Pride and similar stuff. And again, finally, last but not least, I would have gladly participated to see if the same treatment reserved for two other people would have been reserved, but we were here in the Council and I could not participate, the initiative, however sponsored by the USL, called ""Onstage +"", also here I put + because so at least we avoid quoting, a theatrical show for the promotion of plural and positive male models on the contrast to the discrimination on the contrary to the discrimination. LGBT+, Qayzw hasn't placed here. All this, sees councilor, is not that it annoys me because it has a very precise political matrix that it is opposite to mine, personally in a public space it would annoy me even if there were initiatives that had the same orientation, my own identical thought; They would annoy me a lot, because unfortunately that is a structure financed with public money, with even regional money, and these are calls that are financed with exclusively regional money. So that's why, with this interpellation, councilor, I ask them and I hope to have relative answers precisely to what the assessments adopted to promote calls are, and if the intention was to avoid political conditioning or politically oriented initiatives at the expense of community, what are the reasons to support the concession of the patronage to the ""Onstage +"" event (the show that I have mentioned first) and what actions intend to put in place Citadel of young people are free from any political conditioning and that in the same violence or discrimination to ideas other than those of the left are not perpetrated."
48023,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Politiche giovanili",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,8045,"I had escaped ""the ideas other than those of the left"": I must say that I read his interpellation very carefully, but this last one had escaped me; Sometimes they escape me because I don't think it is possible to write and make categories as clear as she has a habit of doing, so some of her obsessions do not evidently correspond to mine, precisely because I am also naive and sometimes I read them differently. In any case, I answer his questions, I obviously avoid entering into the merits of all his assessments, which obviously are legitimate as far as it concerns but who are his evaluations, however, and which are outline of the requests that makes me. ""What are the evaluations adopted to promote the calls and if the intention was to avoid political conditioning or politically oriented initiatives at the expense of the community"": the regional administration, with the resolution of the regional council n. 788 on 8 July 2024, approved, pursuant to article 17, paragraph 5 of the regional law 13/2014, the collaboration agreement between the Municipality of Aosta and the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, governing the relations regarding the management of the Citadel of young people of Aosta; I referred to the regional law on purpose, because it is the regional law that regulates relations with the Citadel of the young people of Aosta. The necessity for the Region was also found, although not participating, this I would like it to be clear, in the co -coating procedure (we have prevented them from entering the co -coating procedure), to provide, beyond the resources intended for the sharing of the Region to the operating expenses, as defined with the aforementioned DGR (resolution of the regional council), the call for specific calls for non -profit entities, cultural associations and private entities, The same are necessarily belonging to the co -surgery partnership, to be destined for the organization of initiatives and activities aimed at young people to be carried out in the urban area, with attention also to the spaces connected to the citadel of young people near it, that is, anyone, anyone who can participate and anyone who wants to participate was legitimized to do so. It is clarified that the calls in question have been issued by the competent organizational structures on youth and culture policies, in compliance with the specifications cited regional laws 69/1993 and 12/2013. Specifically, as far as competence, on the purely cultural act, the announcement, launched pursuant to regional law 69/1993 (contributions for cultural and scientific activities and initiatives), was aimed at cultural, artistic and scientific initiatives made entirely in the city of Aosta, with particular attention to the area of ​​the Citadel of Young people and the urban areas considered more fragile, capable of proposing territorial animation and repercussions also in terms of social development. Economic, but in which the purpose of cultural, artistic and scientific production and promotion remains priority, in particular that aimed at the younger generations, which is then the mission of the citadel. What projectable projects are meant reviews, concerts, festivals, exhibitions, laboratory cycles, playful activities and other small and large events, aimed at sensitizing the younger generations to the various forms of art, to support and encourage visual arts, music, entertainment, writing, literary culture and cinema, the cultural traditions of the Aosta Valley and in general every artistic expression, as well as increasing the offer and enriching the calendar of the Initiatives present in the area aimed at the Youth Band under 30. The events subject to contribution, in addition to being of quality, aim to encourage youth participation, strengthen the value bond between young people and territory and promote cultural occasions and opportunities. With this first announcement, six projects obtained the loan. As I always say, I would like to specify that I do not within in any way within this type of evaluations, I learn about when I do the press conferences, so there is a technical evaluation commission. If these doubts reported to other subjects can be more or less accredited, as far as I am concerned, as I have always said, I do not put it with these, on the contrary, the fact of not having participated in the co -owner went precisely in the direction of avoiding any type of doubt or any type of suspicion. With regard to the youth policy sector, on which the funding of the projects that have submitted, pursuant to the public notice 1/2024 ""young people in the city"" depend, there were eight questions made by non-profit entities and concerning cultural, artistic and recreational-recreational initiatives, aimed at enhancing the youth protagonism. The first five identified by a specific evaluation commission were financed, of which I am not part, of course. The projects, already in progress, will end by March 31, 2025. Attention in this sector was paid to initiatives aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles, the development of personality and autonomy, based on the intake of personal and collective responsibilities, to the enhancement of skills, creativity and aggregative experiences of socialization and cooperation, through the direct involvement of teenagers and young people. The question two: ""What are the reasons to support the concession of the patronage to the"" Onstage +""event (there is a +, small), a theatrical show for the promotion of plural and positive male models on the contrast of the LGBTQ +discrimination, which have benefited from the patronage of the USL and if we consider the same free from any political conditioning"". He asks me and I can tell her that the aforementioned initiative beyond subsidized activities with regional calls. There was no request for patronage to this department and was organized directly by the USL of the Aosta Valley; At least, that's what the offices write to me. The citadel, in fact, in the premises of which the structure is made up, then Arena, Dance space, cafeteria and conference rooms, makes available, according to a precise tariff, which obviously can be requested from the corporation leader, to whom we are also subject to us, I must say it, the schools or the other subjects who ask to be able to use them, the spaces that can be booked and also used by public and private individuals external to the Location. of the Aosta Valley. So I imagine that it should ask the question, rather than to me, to those who represent the USL. ""What are the actions that the Region intends to put in place so that the citadel of young people are free from any political conditioning and that in the same violence or discrimination to ideas other than those of the left are not perpetrated"" (a little smiles this thing): the control by the structures of the Department is on the initiatives that obtain regional contribution, for which being apolitical, inclusive, secular in the proposed contents is. eligibility. The projects that on these first bands benefit from the grant, as well as of cultural interest, intended to increase the offer intended for young people, present these punctual requirements. Then, if according to her, they do not present these punctual requirements, it is entitled to detect it, but, as far as I am concerned, I also trust offices and those who make the assessments, therefore of the commission, so I can say that on the basis of what they transmit and tell me, the requirements are still requirements that go beyond the left -wing location of the subjects who win these calls."
48023,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Politiche giovanili",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,4416,"He rightly began, and also concluded, his intervention with a little humorous appendix, so let's call it, compared to the question I asked the left, but precisely the question about the left orientation, in reality, it is not a provocation, it is unfortunately a fact, and I explain to her why. She said she is a naive, I am sure that she is not a naive, and I am sure that they were not naive even those who - will apologize to me if I quote, but I quote the title of a newspaper, of different newspapers - to the citadel of young people welcomed people who had no leftist ideas saying to them: ""fascists of shit go"". Unfortunately this is in the documents, with such obviously of police intervention, verbalizations, stops of people and so on, so it is evident that if someone has felt free to be able to affirm something of this type ... or another of the declarations that came out is: ""This is an anti -fascist or anti -fascist festival (because they were men, so at least the colleagues are happy)"" and we talk about Frontdoc, we are not talking about things that are not very marked. If someone has felt in the right to be able to say something of this type, evidently there is a truth of truth. Someone considers his, and only his space, and nobody can touch him, I imagine that this is the way of feeling. I thank you, and I have not doubted that you have oriented the choices or financing of these projects of the announcement towards someone, absolutely in the most absolute way, but I allow myself and I allowed myself to ask, since it is true that she does not decide whoever wins, but the guidelines and the result you want to obtain instead you write it, if the result is what she writes, and therefore obviously you have to have activities that are apolitical and have a cultural interest; A series of things that I have listed, for example, do not fall into what is the original spirit. You will have read the statute of the Citadel, as well as the rightly reference law, and knows very well that the Citadel was born primarily to give support services to young people, for example, study classrooms, recreational classrooms, spaces such as the theater where you can range and so on, but knows that all this is done by putting the Francophonia and collaboration with Albertville in the first place, this is written in the law, in the law, this is highlighted in the law, All parts. Then, he sees, I take only the first of those I mentioned to her, but the multidisciplinary festival on the theme of the history of color people, I look at it and I wonder exactly what relevance to has with the Francophonia and with Albertville: it has no relevance, it is clearly evident, just as the Gay Pride does not have it, as well as the ""onstage"" has it. Moreover, I am not asking for an account, councilor, to its department: I know how the division of the initiatives you do works, because I participated, even if for six months in the majority, what happens and I know very well that when an interpellation or question arrives it is said: ""This is mine, this is yours, this is yours, this to the dog, this to the cat, this to the sorcio"", so the fact that she has been assigned to her Answer, it's not that I ask her because the USL put her patronage on a stuff of that type, but I ask the junta and then she replies, so it is not that she was wrong interlocutor, I had asked the junta, she replies for everyone, otherwise the commissioner Marzi would have taken the floor and he would have explained me exactly what is the ultimate purpose of this patronage. Having said that, I want to grasp the positive spirit he said, and I really appreciated the fact that the region and the Department that she guides have not participated in the co -cogee, that it is nothing but a ""a fra ', that you need? Let's see how much money can I give you"", but it is clear that the doubt that unfortunately a basic politicization remains not dispelled. We will therefore continue to punish this topic if other initiatives of this type will occur. For now, on the projects that have been listed, we will watch and I am sure that we will have bad surprises for us, but some beautiful surprises to offer for her and perhaps deny what she imagined, that is, the politicity of these initiatives."
48024,XVI,21/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,5573,"This initiative resumes another initiative discussed already and presented by colleague Perron relative to the actions necessary for the qualification of Valley teachers at the University of Valle d'Aosta, because this theme is of absolute interest and absolute pre -eminence in this period. The teaching qualification is a crucial junction for those who aim for a teacher's career, representing an indispensable requirement not only for access to the profession, but also for the subsequent contractual stabilization; And this step is enriched with added value considering the evolution of the educational context and the need for increasingly targeted and qualified preparation. The decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of 4 August 2023 goes precisely in this direction, defining the training course for teaching qualification. The procedures for obtaining the qualification to teach differ significantly on the basis of the school level and the specificity of the teaching role. This variety reflects the distinct training needs between teaching in primary kindergartens compared to that of first and second grade secondary schools. Similarly, there are variations in the methods of qualification between common places and supports, highlighting the needs of a diversified and targeted training approach to the particular didactic and educational responsibilities characteristic of each category. If nothing has changed regarding the qualification path for teaching in primary kindergartens, however, the changes for first and second grade secondary schools are significant. Specifically, the initial training system of access to the permanent roles of teachers foresees first of all a university and academic path of initial training, corresponding to at least 60 university or academic training credits, therefore CFU or CFA, to be carried out to acquire theoretical-practical skills after graduation or during the training course. Subsequently, aspiring teachers must support a national public competition organized on a regional or interregional basis, on an annual basis. If winners of competition, aspiring teachers must pass a trial period in service of one year that provides for a final test and a final evaluation also on the didactic skills acquired by the teacher during the year of training. Waiting for the new system to go up to operation, a transitional phase is scheduled until 31 December 2024, during which those who have been teaching for at least three years in the state school can directly access the competition and, if winner, must then achieve 30 credits and carry out the qualification test in order to be able to pass. In addition, those who have achieved at least 30 CFU or CFA or 24 CFU or CFA provided for as access requirement according to the previous system are admitted to participate in the competition. Finally, the winners of the competition on common place not qualified, in possession of 30 CFU or CFA or 24 CFU or CFA achieved by 31 October 2022, are hired with a part-time annual contract and must complete the university and academic path of initial training with a final test which, if outdated, will be followed by the annual test period. The teacher courses provided for by the standard are organized and provided through academic university centers of initial training of teachers, which include a internship period at schools and the final test, with a simulated lesson, to examine the teaching capacity that must present an educational approach, innovative and consistent with the training received. Those who exceed these assessments will achieve the qualification for the reference class class, thus undertaking the path to teaching, which provides, after qualification, participation in a competition and a year of testing on the field, concluded by a final test and a total evaluation. In summary, the new teaching qualification path is structured as follows: a master's degree, three years for ITP, plus 60 CFU or CFA qualification courses, plus competition, plus proof year in service with final test and final evaluation. Here we come to what is the criticality that we have already raised and which has already raised the colleague Perron primar inside this classroom, that is, the fact that the formation of Valley teachers is paid by structures that are placed outside the region, competitions with limited numbers, which force teachers who need qualification to consume holidays and permits to follow the courses, in addition to obviously the cost of transfers. In addition to this, we must also add the criticality of the coverage of the moment when the course is followed, because it is clear that if a teacher follows the course outside the region leaves the place discovered that it must be covered in another way, and all this is downloaded as a personal cost on teachers, on the other side evidently as a cost on the public administration and finally on students. This is why with this interpellation we ask the competent councilor if they are aware of what was reported and, if so, if it is the intention to prepare, in agreement with the University of Valle d'Aosta, every action useful to organize the necessary courses for qualifying Valley teachers."
48024,XVI,21/11/2024,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Personale docente e non docente",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,FP-PD,4,5303,"As you mentioned, the theme has already been the subject of various initiatives, so some things are repeated. She asks me if you are aware of what was reported: evidently yes. Then he asks me, if so, if it is the intention to prepare, in agreement with the University of Valle d'Aosta, every action useful to organize the courses necessary for the qualification of the Aosta Valley teachings. I make a premise that, in my opinion, can be useful, perhaps it is a novelty: since I responded to different interpellations, I do not remember if I communicated it to this, obviously I confirm that I am aware of what reported and, as already reported in response to previous interpellations and questions on this issue, I repeat that the University of Valle d'Aosta has been active in an active way for a comparison with the superintendence to the studies and with the union organizations. We have done several meetings in order to propose actions to support Valley teachers who must complete their training course through the achievement of CFU. In this regard, I would like to point out that the agreements between the superintendence of studies and school union organizations were signed last October to grant paid permits for study reasons, both in 2024 and in 2025 (it is the first time that it is done, and I believe it is the first supplementary contract that is done in the valley with the school unions), giving priority to the teaching staff hired with a fixed -term contract (therefore also aimed at time determined), obviously with subsequent entry into the role, however this following the ordinary competition 2023 PNRR, registered in specific training courses aimed at the acquisition of university or academic training credits, CFU and also CFA, therefore also those for people with disabilities. We therefore put around a table and tried to understand how to facilitate them, even from a point of view of the use of time, because as she detected and as her colleague had also detected, it is a not indifferent commitment. The fact that you go out of working hours, without so far being formalized specifically that the permits for study could also be used, was objectively a problem that you have also detected, so that you have also contributed to bring to the surface. I also remember that last year the University of Aosta Valley signed, together with the University of Turin, at the University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro, at the Polytechnic of Turin, at the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts in Turin and at the Belle Arts Academy of Cuneo, the Convention on Cifis, which is the interregional center for the training of secondary teachers, in which it was established to identify Cifis as an institution and center deputy to the organization of the routes referred to in the DPCM August 4, 2023. Then, also on these courses, as you know, each tot change: 24 credits, 60; It is not always so clear, so every time it is a having to take note of the ministerial decisions and organize themselves accordingly. The routes were activated for the first time in the academic year 2023-2024, as I had already said to his colleague, starting from spring 2024, and now I am under conclusion. There have not yet been made known by the Ministry of University and Research - which I did not believe since I did it since the note was provided to me, that is, for a few days - indications regarding the activation of the paths for the academic year 2024-2025; We are still waiting to understand what will happen now, over time already passed. The assessments regarding the possible provision of didactic activities at UNI VDA for the academic year 2024-2025 will be assumed, beyond and after having known that intentions has the ministry, also following a comparison within the Cifis, and, in any case, they could concern, as is obvious and natural and as I have already had the opportunity to say to its colleague, only disciplinary didactics of a very small number of qualification classes, because the classes are classes. Many and it is evident that it cannot be structured except in classes where there is still the safety of a certain basin, while remaining always in the end of the Cifis - this is part of the agreement that has been stipulated - the provision in electronic mode of any transversal didactic. She asked me for the University of Valle d'Aosta what it intends to do: she intends to renew the request to predict a reserve of seats in favor of candidates residing in the valley in the courses that will be activated by the Cifis for the academic year 2024-2025 for the qualification classes in relation to which a needs of teachers authorized in the school of the Region has been reported. I believe that the answer is a little similar to the one I gave last time to his colleague and I believe that it comforts the fact that, however, you are working and that everything you could do is do so, in collaboration also with the representatives of the teachers who in this case, as I said, are teachers hired on a fixed -term, obviously waiting to complete the CFU path."

It is evident that if on the one hand we can be satisfied with the progress that have made themselves, which certainly introduce the facilities for Valley teachers, both as regards future teachers, those who still have to make training, and in the form of permits and with respect to the question of places. However, it is evident as equally, councilor, that the problem of transfers remains, and this unfortunately is a serious problem, because clearly we must imagine that already at the course of the course that the teachers follow if two others are added that they are a first leg and one of the return of course in Turin ... so it is clear that all this acute a little the problem of the transport timing and also of the quality of life of the people who are committed. Meanwhile, I thank you for the answer, evidently this criticality, that of transport, remains; He rightly raised the question of the multiplicity of the classes of the specializations that are many, so maybe organize them all not, but as rightly and in the same way with which you have reported the request to the Cifis to be able to have a reserve of places to make available to the Aosta Valley, in the same way it could be, verifying what are the classes that there is greater necessity, perhaps to do something that can allow the Valley teachers to be able to attend to take costs, waste of time and clearly improve the quality of life and teaching."
48026,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,4885,"Let's go back with this interpellation on the theme of renewable energy communities, on which we have presented several initiatives over the past two years, because we think they can be a tool of considerable importance to increase the production of renewable and clean energy in our region, to develop a production of energy spread in the area and to create participation, community spirit and then also to try to overcome energy poverty situations. As we all know, the Regional Council on 23 July approved the regional law no. 15 (""Provisions for the promotion and development of widespread self -consumption"") which, in article 4, paragraph 5, states that the regional council establishes, with its own resolution, the criteria and methods of granting and reporting of contributions provided for in favor of belonging to self -consumption configurations for the construction of plants located in municipalities with more than 5 thousand inhabitants. This is an important rule, which we have supported to ensure that residents in the municipality of Aosta can take advantage of a 40% contribution on the costs for the installation of photovoltaic systems, as it happens, thanks also to PNRR funds, for those who are resident in all other Valle d'Aosta municipalities, which are those under 5 thousand inhabitants. Already in September we had asked for news about the regional council resolution that must define the methods of implementing the legal device: we had been told that it was ongoing, so after a further two months we return to the subject, also urged by various citizens of Aosta who would be interested in joining a CER and using the contribution that is provided for by our law. This is the first point of inter -apellance. The second is instead a request for information on the applications submitted to the competent office by the Municipalities, or in a single form or in associated form, to take advantage of the contribution on feasibility studies to constitute a CER, and always speak of the regional contribution. We are still in an initial phase, there is still some time to constitute the CER, to ask for the contribution provided by the PNRR, but it is not that then there is so much time, so we would like to understand what is happening and that dynamics are there. Then there is a third question that addresses the interpellation and concerns the debate that has been in recent months on the opportunity or not to create a CER Regional Multicabine, which would somehow umbrella to some dozen self-consumption configurations of a municipal or over-communal nature. In the premises we recalled that the Sani-Zangrando study, commissioned by the Region, had highlighted the feasibility of the CER Regional Multicabine and also indicated what could be the advantages. Furthermore, always in the premises, we point out that the Friuli Venezia Giulia Autonomous Region has oriented itself precisely in the direction of constituting a regional Cer. We made contact with the direction of the defense of the environment and the development of energy and sustainable development, we then saw the law but we asked for information on what is contained in the regional law 7 August 2024, n. 7, which in Article 4, paragraph 19, states verbatim: ""The regional administration is authorized to support the charges deriving from the assignment, through the procedures provided for by the sector legislation, of a service aimed at the design and establishment of a renewable energy community, Cer Regional, called 'I am Friuli Venezia Giulia'"". The fact that an autonomous region like us, but with a million, indeed, with more than a million inhabitants, has chosen the road to the Regional Cer, we believe that it must make us reflect. You all know, for a year we have been arguing that the option of the regional cer multicabine is the necessary to take off the Cer Movement in the Aosta Valley and, as I said, this setting also finds comfort in the feasibility documented by the Sani-Zangrando studio; It was heard, we heard it, by the presidents of the Unité des Communes and now finds a implementation not here, but a precise implementation in an autonomous region. We are still in time and, in our opinion, it is necessary to make a further reflection on the architecture of the Cer in the Aosta Valley and the Region, obviously through the Department which is the reference department, which in our opinion should assume the responsibility to actively support this movement. The third question we asked is if it is not considered appropriate, given the elements that have been indicated and also the developments that have been there not here, but elsewhere, to start further reflection regarding the opportunity of the establishment of a CER Regional Multicabine."
48026,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965.0,M,UV,4,6444,"With this initiative we return to the theme of the CER and I say it without controversy, at least in the introduction, in the sense that we speak of it many times and obviously with different roles the oppositions stimulate the government to try to achieve the objectives and on the other hand the government proposes, through its answers, both the work it is doing but also the obstacles and objectives it is defining, with the times that can be achieved in the public administration on such a complex measure. I say complex because I believe, above all you, is reading a lot of what happens in this world, also in this sector there are many articles that however highlight the importance of the CER, at the same time the complexity of activating them, to make them: still today they are defined, also by the Polytechnic of Milan rather than by others, realizations of investments of still niche designs, precisely for their complexity. Beyond this, however, we have defined it with law and in Pear and strategies we continue to work. As for the first question, given that in any case with the notice that will also have to give an answer to the self -consumption located in the Aosta territory, especially in the territories above the 5 thousand inhabitants, there are two orders of problems that are being evaluated by our structure, together with the competent structures: one is the use of structural funds and the other is the theme of state aid, given that in this case the investment project, the help, will also go to companies, to citizens, to associations, to associations, to associations, to associations. Local authorities. In this respect, therefore, there is a work in progress with these structures, the notice is in advance, it is not yet ready for a resolution of the council; Obviously the goal is to bring it as soon as possible in approval, but when it will have all the elements to be deliberated, given, I repeat, the two themes that must be addressed together with the structures that work with us to carry on this project. I take this opportunity to say that, on the other hand, we will shortly deliberate a further measure, which is that of help to the Municipalities for the preparation of the latter; So in the next 15 days we will go in this direction, to take this resolution. As regards point 2 (how many questions have so far received the competent office by the Valley municipalities to take advantage of the regional contribution on feasibility studies to build a Cer), at the moment no applications have not yet been submitted, but there have been numerous requests for information and meetings made on the territory: on October 2, 2024 Unité des Commune Mont -émilius, 17 October 2024 des communes, October 22, 2024 Municipality of Fontainemore, 28 October 2024 Unité des Communes Mont-Rose, with the Municipalities of the Unité, on October 31st the Municipality of Saint-Marcel, tomorrow there is a meeting in the municipality of Aosta with the most common, and when I say meetings, meetings with the structures of the Energy and the Department. There are many requests for information and there was a need to make a further technical meeting, on October 30, with all the municipalities that have joined and who have had the opportunity to ask further questions on the topic. So we expect, starting from the month of December, the first requests for financing. As for point 3 (if it does not consider it appropriate, given the case of Friuli Venezia Giulia, to start a further reflection on the opportunity of the establishment of a Valdostana multicabine CER Regional), on this theme - perhaps then we did not understand - we have never excluded the possibility of also reaching the establishment of a Valley multicabine. She cites Friuli, the structures of the Co and the Department are also in contact with Friuli, as with those of the other regions; On November 4, the commissioner declared: ""By the end of the year the Region will start a study aimed at exploring the possibility of constituting a regional Cer called 'I am Friuli Venezia Giulia'"". So they are talking about starting a study that is what we are doing. At this moment - I had already said it in the last response - the structures of the finances, of the heritage, the structures of my Department, of the Energy Department and the CoA are also working on the theme of Cer Multicabine, putting together all those elements that are to be studied before starting a project of this nature. As you rightly report in the interpellation, the Sani-Zangrando study highlighted the possibility of constituting a CER Regional Multicabine, listing the advantages and disadvantages of this architecture. In fact, if on the one hand the creation of a cer multicabine allows you to exploit economies of scale, to divide the costs of constitution, on the other a CER to regional guide must be constituted as a more complex legal entity than the CER, also on regional multicabil scale, which are developing from the bottom. This involves higher management costs and due to the public nature of the promoter and particularly complex governance. So we are working, I believe with the times of Friuli Venezia Giulia, to understand within the next few weeks if it can make sense to work on a project by Cer Multicabine; The structures concluded their studies will tell us and they will also tell us how much it will cost it to start it, so that we can reason, in the event that the studies complete with a positive evaluation, on an appropriate bill, a modification of the bill that we already have on energy communities. As always, I repeat, we have to work paying well attention to developing a programming of the growth of the CER in the Aosta Valley that is compatible with the times of constitution that the public administration has, with the complexities that all this entails and without necessarily attracting from the resources of the PNRR which, for what is our knowledge, are currently still widely available to all the communities that will be constituted, because evidently also in other territories, especially with respect to the public nature of these They are similar to those we are facing. Next, therefore, with the right attention, trying to support, especially in this phase, the local authorities that will start projects and above all the studies that are necessary."
48026,XVI,21/11/2024,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,6,3871,"I immediately say in the introduction that, since this is an important theme, at least we consider it such, it is logical that we return and that we also return with a certain insistence, also because two months ago she had told us, councilor, that the resolution was in progress, now it tells us that the situation is in an advanced phase, that there are two orders of problems (the question of state aid, the use of the funds), but I remember that A little surprising that it is now said that it is still being studied. There are various people in Aosta who have planned investments thinking of using that contribution of 40% for the installation of photovoltaic systems provided for by law, which rightly fills a gap in the European and Italian legislation, but it is not, in my opinion, acceptable that a principle in law is affirmed and then a timely and coherent application is not given. The legal difficulties that it is not true that they do not exist, there are, I share it, they had to be addressed previously and the weather was there, considered all the time that this law has remained on the waiting list, for more than a year. It is a question that we have asked for a long time and we have said it several times. But what is worrying is the second point, that is, the answer she has given: there are no questions. The law is in July, we saw the notice in September, there are no questions and we are practically at the end of November. Yes, there are meetings in progress, thank goodness, we knew that there have been meetings along the month of October and that there are also others, we also know that there are municipalities that are trying to concert a unitary path, but that it is the only sensible thing that can be done, also of the municipalities that belong to multiple primary cabins, but this path would have been very facilitated if the model of Cer had promptly chosen for our region. Now the municipalities, of course, but we understand it, are in difficulty, time passes, there are deadlines to be respected and they are issues that we had already reported some time ago. Fortunately, there is also an initiative in Valle d'Aosta, as regards the establishment of Cer, a private initiative: there are already five cer constituted, if I'm not mistaken, if I have not lost some of them on the street, but by the public the commitment is not consequent. You also said that there are many requests for information, but of course, it is safe, because the path had to be above all on information level, but not informative in the general sense, in a more pragmatic sense it had to be carried out previously. On the third and last point, she says that there is no opposition, this is pleased. However, beyond the opposition, however, we must also define what you want to do and I believe that if a reality as big as that of Friuli Venezia Giulia activates a regional law, because it activates it, I told her that there is a law article that establishes funds to support a service aimed at the design and establishment of a cer multicabine, there is a reason. We talked to the managers of that department, of that region, and what has been confirmed to us is that there is a precise desire to go in that direction. Small municipalities have the opportunity to have PNRR financing, but they have objective difficulties in going on alone. The municipality of Aosta today has not yet the implementation resolution, I believe that we are a bit badly. Standing, as we asked for a long time ago, a regional Cer could have helped, in our opinion, better the municipalities. What I hope, given what you said, is that there is the intention to go in that direction and perhaps even to arrive at a modification of the law approved in July."
48027,XVI,21/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, INFORMAZIONE, Sistema informativo",en,Foudraz,Raffaella,1968.0,F,LEGA VDA,2,3910,"The initiative in question was born after reading the report on the activity of the permanent regional observatory on legality and organized crime of the mafia type which has received all the regional councilors with a note sent on 28 October last. Within the report, the political decision -makers are suggested to evaluate the possibility of providing the Chambre Valdôtaine of the Regional Application Explorer (Rex), however already in use to numerous chambers of commerce; There are several regions that have adopted this application, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Lombardy, Veneto, just to name a few. A useful tool to better know the internal dynamics of the life of companies operating in the area, thus also providing for the possibility of access to the IT platform by the police forces, because all this would allow to cross the databases of the Chambers of Commerce, arriving in the register of companies of the European Union. An application that contains names and numbers that the Chamber of Commerce makes available to law enforcement to cut off usury, extortion, mixes with mafia organizations, in order to promote preventive and combat actions of the spread of criminal phenomena in economic activities. Because it emerges, however, from this relationship that, from the origins, mafia organizations have pursued two objectives: to manage money and power. Infiltrate, rooting in territories far from those of origin, economically more flourishing, has therefore been a consequence. They certainly did not use weapons or explosives, they inserted themselves into the company by bringing families, planting roots, obtaining residence and starting to vote. The mafias, especially the 'Ndrangheta, have preferred the small realities with a few thousand inhabitants. This is precisely because the control of the territory must therefore be made visible and the mafia, to be such, must be recognized. Always from the report, it is clear that in any case the Aosta Valley is a geographically dispersive region, in which it is therefore easier to isolate the subjects; So the need to network is also reiterated also and above all at the level of the individual municipalities, which are obviously the antennas of the territory, also through awareness campaigns. It refers that another fundamental aspect is precisely to invest in culture and information, exploiting the formidable flywheel that is represented by the university. It is also stated that one must understand that, in certain contexts, there may be unclear situations, which therefore must be reported to be examined by professionals, such as the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza, and these reports will be developed and deepened. Also in the report, it is stated that today there is a cerimous approach by organized crime, therefore, perhaps grasping the economic difficulties of a certain moment and thus providing support to the entrepreneur, who unfortunately accepts without being aware of who is the subject with whom he is entering into relationship. The territory must therefore become waterproof to these attempts at infiltration. Why all this? Because in any case, always reading the report, it also emerges that the anti -mafia investigative division, in the last half -yearly report on the activities carried out in the month of June, has however certified, once more, as for some time now the Aosta Valley is hunting ground for the mafias. Since precisely in the report it is suggested to equip the Chambre Valdôtaine of this Regional Explorer application, the competent councilor is asked if it is intentioned to go in the direction suggested by the report that I have just mentioned and possibly with which timing."

So his initiative - I will not say as every now and then it is said: ""We were doing it"" - surely it will be a stimulus to do it, and I say it because I heard the president of the Chambre, who told me that it is a theme they are tackling. I only say that today there is a platform called ""Telemaco"" and that guarantees access to all the chambre data to all law enforcement and a method and an organization that allow different institutions to work already constantly and effectively and there is a good collaboration to work in this direction. But the systems evolve, improve, there are certainly new ways that can be the subject of further investments. From what we have understood, they are quite important investments, which must be put in the programming of the work of the chamber. We have also guaranteed with the budget projects of these years also a growth in chambre funding, this year too we have proposed an increase in the contribution of 200 thousand euros, so they are also resources that we make available to projects like these. I repeat, the initiative will be a stimulus to go in this direction and still improve the organization that can be given to guarantee all the necessary actions to our territory to effectively deal with the actions to combat crime and, I repeat, for the competitiveness also necessary for our territory."

This demanding committed the competent councilors to make synergy between them ""so that the completion of the entire route of the Baltea cycle path of the valley floor is one of the priorities of the regional government"" and therefore commit to ""relating to the competent commissions within six months regarding some sections that are still not defined today, in such a way as to have a precise picture to be able to proceed with the subsequent stages for its realization and consequent completion of the track"". We also recall the subsequent interpellation discussed in the Regional Council at the end of July 2024, having as its object the ""implementation of the commitment assumed with the approval of an agenda concerning the Baltea cycle path of valley floor"". Taking into account the answers provided by the competent councilor during the various debates in the classroom, the competent councilor is therefore asked if there is the intention of planning with the president of the relative competent council commission for a useful session to be able to illustrate and carry out the necessary insights relating to the traits not yet defined by the Baltea cyclovia of Fondovalle, with the aim of having a precise picture of the general situation and being able to proceed as soon as possible with the subsequent situation phases for its realization and consequent completion of the route. In the event of an affirmative answer to the first question, if there is the possibility of providing for the deepening in the commission before the board meeting dedicated to the budget 2025-2027. Just the day before yesterday was spoken in the competent commissions and, given the importance of the issue regarding the Valle d'Aosta region and the whole tourist system, it is more than appropriate to deal with the topic here."

I thank the commissioners, the commission presidents, last Tuesday, first of the works that will see us engaged for the budget and for another another series of dossiers who sees the third particularly active commission. Thank you for the various initiatives and for the attention he places on the subject. The months taken from the commitment of the agenda of the Regional Council were used to equip the administration of a computer support that allowed anyone to be able to verify in real time the state of the art of the advancement of the works of realization of the cycle path of the valley floor, classified of regional interest. In fact, it is now available on the Geoportale SCT of the Region - we have seen it with the colleagues who were present - a specific cartographic section that is dedicated and that reports the information regarding this itinerary, identifying in a separate way the traits of the track that have already been made and which are regularly open, the traits of track in progress, the traits of the cycle path with already approved designs and the portions of the territory that are now discovered. This information tool, through a specific preparation that allows you to differentiate the different itineraries, immediately allows local authorities interested to load the local slopes of their competence, potentially taking on a specific reference to said tool for users of the cycle paths on the entire regional territory. A work that is then carried out with the local authorities is that of the various connections, of the interventions which, placed by connection by what are the municipal itineraries to the central axis (we talked about it in that project that will benefit from the funds of the Ministry of the Environment) in Châtillon, or others who have been carried out during the settlement phase (the catwalk that will connect Fénis, Saint-Marcel to Nus and then the connection, always with the Ministerials, which will connect the Aymavilles sports area to the Saint-Pierre side cycle path). In parallel, then, in the process of definition, with the regional civil protection, the preparation of an information section of the tool described here, which will allow to facilitate and speed up any rescue operations to be carried out on the regional relevance itinerary by defining access and therefore all the various accesses, so that the means of speech can provide in a short time to the rescue operations, both on the cartography but also physically on the territory and the relative coverage of the traits of the track. The updated situation was illustrated with the transmission of a scheme that we faced precisely in the Commission; In particular, those who are a little critical traits should be reported: n. 2, the one between Donnas and Hône, who is currently being deepened, therefore with a loan to be acquired and a situation that still sees the project in place because, as we said, it is a territorially difficult trait, of a 4 km kilometer development. Then the trait n. 5, the one between Montjovet and Saint-Vincent: the design situation is still to be developed, but here has been commissioned a geological study of the side of the so-called Montgiovetta, just to certainly make more than an attempt to go to develop the cycle section in that section, certain of a not indifferent tourist appeal. Here it is 4 km. And then the features 13, 14 and 15, or Villeneuve-Avise, Avise-Morgex and Morgex-Courmayeur, on which the reasoning and developments will be made parallel to what is the path of the regional transport plan. Here we are talking about 6 km for the Villeneuve-Avise section, 5 for Morgex and 7 for the Morgex-Courmayeur section; The kilometers will then be better defined with the design phase. As I said, on 19 November we therefore carried out a specific hearing with the competent council commission, in which we illustrated and carried out the necessary insights relating to the sections that are not yet defined today for what the Baltea cycle path is. Then we, as mentioned, dealt with all the points specifically with, I would say, a constructive and important comparison which, certainly, will follow others."
48028,XVI,21/11/2024,SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO,en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,4459,"Obviously we thank the commissioner for the methods and approach he always has towards these issues and in providing data and answers. The speech that she said in the opening of your answer is obviously better late than never, so it is fine that we dealt with the day yesterday the theme. We think this meeting has been set to try to repair this delay in facing the theme, also because, if we look at the calendar, there would still have been two useful dates before the budget in order to allow you to face in a natural and correct way, as it should have been, the initiative in the Council and then face it in the Commission. But this is not the important thing, the important thing is then to get to the result, then bring the theme to the commission and tackle the theme. What we are a little sorry - and here is not a controversy certainly towards you, because she is now councilor who plays that role there -, here we are talking about a theme that, as emerged during the commission, of an process, as regards the valley cycle path, party twenty years ago. So she is there at the moment, it is obvious that it is our interlocutor about this theme and it is right that we talk about it together. Unfortunately, let's say with displeasure, after 20 years we learn that of the features available to this Baltea Ciclovia di Fonovalle, we have 33 km of sections made out of 84, two in the execution phase, 6 which are in award; Then we have 9 km of strokes designed but for which the resources must still be found, 10 km of unused and even 23 km, which are the famous ones, the non -defined ones, which is a bit the situation that it was when we made the demanding last year. This is a bit the point on which we want to emphasize. We try to sensitize greater attention; In fact, we talked about competent departments, because it is true that its Department is the one that goes to carry out the structure and infrastructure of the cycle path, but it is a theme that obviously also affects the part of tourism, because several times, through initiatives, we have said that, as Rassemblement Valdôtaine, we strongly support the great events on our territory: next year there will be several events of great importance, such as the Giro d'Italia, the stages of the world cup in the world Thuile. What we want to put attention on is that these major events, in addition to the sports aspect, must be events that are excellent windows, from an international point of view, to better convey all that is the regional tourist offer. So we know well that part of Baltea Ciclovia di Fonovalle would be the basis and then build everything related to the cycle tourist system in its various specialties; Because we all know that the bicycle is one of the first things on which all children, people, learn to stay above, and the cycle path has slopes, of the technical characteristics perfectly ideal for promoting cycle tourism; The mass, therefore we are talking about numbers, therefore also in a tourist perspective, goes for the benefit of everything that is the Valle d'Aosta tourist apparatus. In addition, we are talking about a discipline that can be carried out eight months a year, so this specialty deserves such a specialty here, because we know the repercussions in tourist and economic terms on our region, which can give this cycle path available as soon as possible. Also this being able to complete the whole project complete would then allow to complete all those branches in the lateral valleys, which complete the cycling system of all our region. Obviously, the ideal would have been to have at least a complete part, for example in the valley floor, which connects with the national network to Piedmont, towards the other regions, compared to what we have today, which we have incomplete and unrelated sections, therefore potentially not so strong from a tourist point of view. Our suggestion and our attention, which will also arrive with subsequent initiatives, always on a proactive level, are to try to commit both to a financial level but also be very careful to try to reach this milestone as soon as possible, without passing over twenty years."
48029,XVI,21/11/2024,EDILIZIA,en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,2,5946,"The interpellation resumes a question of which the Council had dealt several times last year: the project of the building The Stone al Breuil, who had aroused many critical surveys and on which 1,128 residents or owners of Valtournenche houses had expressed their opposition with a petition, which was deposited at the Municipality on July 27, 2023. The building designed - A height of 30 meters with nine floors and would have been built instead of the former Hôtel Fosson, a four -storey structure, which would have been demolished. The project provided for the change of intended use from hotel to building to residential use, thus pursuing a objective not consistent with a development perspective respectful of the environmental, economic and tourist needs of a location already strongly defaced by a heavy urbanization created over time. It was a project with some strongly negative characteristics, as it had been detected by the signatories of the petition, not only of that of residents and owners, but also of the online one that had had many more signatures: a truly not easy environmental impact to reach in a reality already strongly compromised such as that of Breuil, an economic-social opportunity with the abandonment of a local busy hotel for an investment in second homes, obviously intended for a temporal use limited, a procedural opacity, so much so that the The Stone project is also the subject of an investigation, of a judicial proceeding issued in 2023 and still in progress. Last year, in September, after various vicissitudes, even after commissioning and examining legal opinions, in the end the Municipality of Valtournenche had denied permission to carry out this work. Just over a month ago, we then learned that the project was re -proposed with the reduction of a plan, but while remaining characterized by a huge volume for a building that is totally out of scale in the context in which we intend to make it, and when I speak of a context, I speak right where he is, at the center of the location. We received and read the open letter of residents and owners of second houses, dated 27 October, who reconstructs the story of The Stone and invites all the competent authorities to a careful evaluation of the various critical aspects. In this letter there are the expert reports and relationships commissioned by these residents and owners and drawn up by two qualified professional studies, those of the architects Mellano-Bruna and the engineer Pozzi. In the letter, it is stated that both of these appraisals have noted that the project does not calculate the volume of the arrest which, rigorously, instead, must be counted, as confirmed by various judgments of the Court of Cassation and which therefore lead to abundantly exceeding 3,000 cubic meters, what is in contrast with the legislation. The purpose of the inter -apellance we presented is to solicit an initiative of the Region to prevent a negative result from being able to arrive. Councilor Sapinet in a letter addressed some time ago, a few days ago, to the Distort councilor who asked for an examination of the problem in the commission - perhaps having some ideas that do not collide with mine, but in any case with the request for a deepening in the commission -, he said that the Region does not have a direct competence in the release of the construction permit, however there is also undoubted that the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta has instead primary competence in the field of urban planning and protection of the landscape and It cannot ignore, in our opinion, and not even to do as a silent spectator, compared to what happens in an important location such as Breuil. The problem, moreover, goes well beyond the specific case of the The Stone project, concerns the future of all Breuil and the need for regeneration. If you want to do something serious to avoid the aggravation of the situation and plan an urban recovery of the locality, you have to start thinking about it and express yourself in some way. I then add that, in recent days, together with colleague Distort, as members of the third commission, representing the opposition groups, we have signed a letter addressed to the president of the third commission precisely to request a regulatory study on the documents relating to the continuation of the authorization process of The Stone that also takes into account the aforementioned appraisals. The request was put on the agenda of the next commission next Tuesday but obviously, beyond this, the meaning and importance of the questions asked in the interpellation maintain all their raison d'etre. We therefore ask if the Region, beyond the Superintendency, bent over the dossier complex, if the regional offices have acquired, examined and evaluated the opinions and appraisals developed by the architects Mellano-Bruno and by the engineer Pozzi, as well as the two legal opinions commissioned by the Municipality of Valtournenche. We also ask if the Region has started an interlocution with the Municipality of Valtournenche in order to carry out a joint examination of a project that has a regional value and whose authorization would also constitute a precedent. What is meant to intervene with respect to the urban disorder of the Breuil basin and in the immediate and, first of all, to avoid an aggravation of the situation with the creation of buildings like this. Finally, if an urgent legislative intervention is not deemed appropriate to remedy the negative consequences also determined by the legislation and compared to the need for a part of the territory in some realities, it is evident, and I refer to exemplifying, to situations such as those of Valtournenche and Courmayeur."
48029,XVI,21/11/2024,EDILIZIA,en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,4,6793,"In the premises of the interpellation, the recent history of the intervention on the former Hôtel Fosson del Breuil is reconstructed, underlining the negativity of the proposed project, which provides for the transformation of a hotel into a house and inconsistency, with a development perspective respectful of the environmental, economic and tourist needs of the locality. However, I must highlight that the change of destination envisaged is consistent with the municipal regulatory plan, therefore respectful of the skills and choices of municipal planning. As we have already affirmed on other occasions, always on this issue, regarding the The Stone project in Valtournenche, the non -competence of the regional offices that deal with territorial planning, a non -competence to express themselves on proceedings for the issue of the permit to build ongoing are reiterated. The regional law 11/1998, currently current, establishes that the Region can intervene on the municipal documents concerning urban and construction matters pursuant to article 89, or cancellation of municipal measures, only on resolution or other municipal measures already issued and flexible for cancellation for non -compliance with the provisions of the law. The present case does not correspond at all to the provisions of the law, since there has been no release of the qualification. I must remember again that the competence to the issue of the building permit is for the Municipality, according to the procedures defined by regional law 11/1998. The Region has no title to intervene as part of a procedure for the building permit issuing, without prejudice to the landscape authorization already issued by the Superintendency for Cultural Heritage and Activities. Furthermore, the regional structure had no opportunity to examine the The Stone project, not having been involved in the procedure for issuing the building permit; It is therefore not possible to prefigure the drafting of a specific report on the project. However, coming to the questions, regarding the first, no opinion or expert reports to the regional offices has been delivered, but it is also believed, as mentioned, that there is no competence to enter into the merits of these opinions that instead can support the municipal action. On the second question, it should be noted that among the competences of the regional structures does not specifically include the support and consultancy action, although it has never been subtracted, the structures, to the comparisons and to the interlocutions with local authorities, if obviously asked by the latter, without prejudice to respect for professionalism and municipal skills. As regards the project in question, the regional value of the project is not recognized, which is an initiative similar to other realized or in progress in other Valley municipalities. The action of the structures currently focuses precisely to think about the general urban planning tools that allow local administrations to better manage their territory. With question n. 3, an intervention is required with respect to an alleged urban disorder, effectively crossing the municipal skills regarding local planning, as I have already said several times in this response. The Region defines the general management lines of the territory through the superordinate planning tools required by law. In this sense, as a regional administration, the provisions are being established, for example having started the revision of the regional landscape territorial plan and the regional law on urban planning, in particular, as already mentioned, at a first essential review of the regional law 11 which will be brought to the discussion of the Regional Council. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that the structures are working precisely to complete a first text on which the comparison will then be launched with the different bearers of interests, a job whose timing are greater than the forecasts precisely for the various interlocations that are there and the correlations between the revision of law 11 and then also, among other things, the work table established precisely on the occasion of the revision of the resolution that went to the home plan, Watch out and meet what were the needs expressed by the two municipalities, namely the Municipality of Courmayeur and the Municipality of Valtournenche. As regards the fourth question, it was precisely established, in parallel with the resolution that has, in fact, carried out the discourse on the home plan, a work table with the two municipal administrations of Courmayeur and Valtournenche, precisely with the aim of examining and deepening the issues related to the application of some urban planning rules with respect to the tourist needs of the two centers. Two realities certainly different from the others, two municipalities that have pointed out and brought to attention what are the critical issues that we know well, therefore a comparison that has been started at this location has already highlighted some critical nodes and also assuming some possible actions to mitigate the effects deemed most negative of some urban planning rules. Then, shortly, we will be able to inform the Council on the possible measures identified or proposals for measures, just in concert with the Municipalities and not imposed on the Municipalities. All this is assumed that it can go to mitigate what are the critical issues that date back, it is good to remember it, to choices made years ago, therefore proposals for rules that can, if carried out, be inserted within what is maintenance. This is to say that you are not silent, that you are not spectators, but you act in the context of your skills, with all its desire to make the structures available to these municipalities, and I also thank the colleagues who will participate in this table. We did a great job for what is the resolution relating to the home plan, convinced that if in two municipalities out of 74 the house plan has brought critical issues (and therefore we are ready to face and solve them), in the other 72 the house plan (and also in these two, with the application of the other articles) has also generated benefits for the Valle d'Aosta community: we remember a saving of land consumption equal to 128 football fields in 14 years of application or the Valley region D'Aosta is the only region where the house plan is applied in historic centers, precisely with that goal, which I would say common, of relaunching our villages. We then proceed with the work table, with the modification of law 11, precisely to meet what is partly also what you support."
48029,XVI,21/11/2024,EDILIZIA,en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,6,4032,"Councilor, she will imagine that I am absolutely not satisfied with her answer. She gave an answer, as she has already done on other occasions, extremely bureaucratic, at the tip of legislation, let's say, citing what are the skills, from the point of view of the law, saying that it has been acted remaining strictly within the stakes and the perimeter that certain rules impose. I tell you, however, that it is difficult not to think that we are silent spectators in the face of all this, it demonstrates the fact that there has not even been the will, by the Region, to acquire also at the level of information, of the possibility of examining documents, those appraisals. I wonder how it is possible that there is not, on the part of the Region, the interest also to understand exactly what important appraisals say about a project that she told me does not have a regional value. Eh well, that it is not a regional value the presence of such an impactful structure, as could be that of Breuil in that context ...! It seems to me that it has a value (Valenza means importance) and importance for the whole region, the one like others that have important impacts and that generate problems in the area. This is demonstrated by the fact that there is around this project, there has been and I think there will be a great debate. She tells me ""no expert report has been delivered"": I understand, I wonder why the Municipality of Valtournenche has not been asked to transmit both those appraisals and the legal opinions, if only just to accompany, not to impose something to the Municipality, but to accompany the actions of the Municipality. And then she says ""the result of certain situations, which can be of compromise of the territory, are the result of choices that have been made years ago"": we have no doubts, but precisely because there has been something that has not worked, it should be the interest of the region trying to help make an orderly planning and an equally ordered urban planning. In my opinion, therefore, it is negative that the Region has not activated even for information purposes, we are convinced that it should instead take this dossier in hand, it should deal with urban disorder. In our opinion, the skills to do this are and not act from a political point of view for us is serious. I tell you more, I believe that the courage and strength to ask the Municipality to suspend that decision should also be had; You said that at the moment no title has been released, but we read from the newspapers that this will be shortly, because there is a favorable opinion of the building commission. One last thing on the issue of the home law, we talked about it, we presented motions, we discussed when there was the resolution on the home law and I want to clarify that we never said that that law must be thrown to nettles. We argued that as regards situations in many municipalities, and I say it knowing what I speak of because I administered in a small municipality, and there is usefulness for a whole series of issues, for expansions, for the possibility of using buildings that otherwise would not even have the minimum requirements to be used, but there are distortions, there were, there was no punctual monitoring action, as the law had provided, time to do. The fact that in the resolution on the home law have been made of the adjustments, welcome the table with the administrations of Valtournenche and Courmayeur who not surprisingly raised the problem, not surprisingly; However, in our opinion, there must also be a deeper reflection on what is the law and go to understand if, from a regional point of view, because we can do it, maintaining some still points, going to affect others, beyond the resolution, because there are resolutions but then there are also laws."
48029,XVI,21/11/2024,EDILIZIA,en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,8,513,"Just to clarify why the colleague then likes to resume the part of response that is not appreciated. Here, as mentioned, we are neither silent nor spectators, so much so that there is a work table that is working on the Valtournenche case, especially Breuil-Cervinia, and on the Courmayeur case, which will soon bring a proposal for modification and integration within the revision of the 11. As regards the monitoring, it was carried out and also well by the almost all of the municipalities."
48029,XVI,21/11/2024,EDILIZIA,en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,10,703,"No, look, on monitoring we can put ourselves to discuss at another moment, but the monitoring that was foreseen by the law, with all the trappings that had been set, has not been carried out over time, and this say the acts, I do not say it. On the question of what may not like me about the answer, I note that you don't like it, because when she says to me ""we have not been silent"" and I tell her yes, she doesn't like it that you tell you, but if you tell me that you have not even acquired the appraisals, at least to view them, which we have asked to do even with an in -depth analysis in the Commission, it is your problem, but in my opinion it is to be silent!"
48030,XVI,21/11/2024,"AMBIENTE, Stoccaggio e smaltimento rifiuti",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,3693,"The Pompiood landfill has long been at the center of an important public and administrative debate. I remember that it is the subject of two masses and a process that has made administrative and management irregularities emerge, starting from the documents relating to concessions and related renewals. In a Virtuosa Valley press release of a few days ago, all these critical issues are well highlighted and the report: the failure to update the environmental impact assessment, despite the increase in volumes, the morphological changes and the expansion of the types of waste, effectively transforming the landfill for inert into a landfill for non -hazardous waste, the failure to comply with the admissibility criteria for inert waste, the contrast with the regional management plan for the management plan of the management of the management of the management of the management. waste, non -compliance with construction criteria, in particular with regard to location, the authorized CEOs and derogations granted, the inadequate distance from the town and the agricultural area, in violation of the precautionary principle, control of confinement barriers and dust, the risk of instability, the inadequate monitoring of the underground waters, the unauthorized contributions ascertained by the Prosecutor's Office as lands and rocks from contaminated with mercury, waste diffusion with antimony, stone containing asbestos fibers, waste not treated with pH values ​​such as to make the rejection dangerous, waste from disturbing with heavy hydrocarbons and mineral oils beyond the limited limits. To these must be added the inconveniences for the population and the incompatibility with the tourist objectives of that area, which is also the object of tourist and cultural enhancement of the area, since we are between the Aymavilles castle and the wonderful Pompiood vineyards. In the commission we are now discussing an update of the fourth volume of the regional waste plan that downgrades some exclusion factors in attention factors, in the event of renewal, and the study commissioned by the Region to ARPA for the reorganization of the inert landfills in the Aosta Valley, drawn up by the ARPA in support of the path aimed at identifying possible solutions for the redevelopment of the PompioD area. The same hypothesizes that the Pompiood landfill becomes a landfill of public management inert, which receives only waste produced in the Valle d'Aosta area, highlights that in the analysis the aspects relating to the technical-administrative procedures eventually necessary for their effective availability have not been considered. He declares that the Pompiood landfill represents the approaching option in shorter times and is functional to guarantee the continuity of service in the short term. Given all the impeding factors of the settlement, renewal or new concession of any type of system on the Pompiood site and the need for a definitive and punctual realization of the work of reclamation and post -operational management, complete with thirty -year control plan in timely observation of all national and local regulations on the subject, as repeatedly highlighted, among other things, by the various committees that have also followed in these periods in the regional government if we ask the regional government if Deputies offices have verified all the aspects relating to the technical-administrative procedures necessary for the actual availability of the Pompiood landfill and the results of the same, what are the procedures that are intended to start why the Aymavilles-PompioD landfill becomes a landfill of public management inert, and I underline public management, which receives only waste produced in the Valle d'Aosta area."
48030,XVI,21/11/2024,"AMBIENTE, Stoccaggio e smaltimento rifiuti",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,4,8069,"First of all, I thank the colleague for the initiative that allows us to return to the topic, the topic we dealt with in a special session of the third board commission in which, alas, she was absent and sorry, because it is precisely on that occasion that we presented the Arpa study by saying a little what I will report today, so it is good to talk about it so that she can also be updated in the official location. An analysis that was developed as part of an action envisaged in the waste plan. The regional waste management plan provides that this action is developed in concert by Celva and the Region and to give concreteness to this action, the ARPA has been asked to develop a study to support the decisions that public bodies, owners of the landfills, are called to take for their reorganization; In reality, then our studies are well known to be two, a first phase which was followed by the second. I saw its reference to the Regional Council Resolution 1.224 of 17 October 2022 which is the proposal for environmental redevelopment intervention presented by the Municipality of Aymavilles, considered shareable by the working group; It presupposes the filling of the landfill with an adequate - but albeit reduced compared to the authorized profile, therefore reduced - reprofing of the soil in its original configuration. So the use of inert material, and we stop there, because this is the great game that is playing, it can certainly represent an element of opportunity. On page 15 of Phase 2 of the Arpa Studio there is then an express request from the Municipality of Aymavilles, which speaks of a volumetric variation, obviously that it is intended as a downward variation, therefore a further less capacity, which is precisely a request that in the comparison in progress was placed at the table by the two municipalities, Aymavilles and Jovençan, with whom we have worked and works constantly, and of course the intention is to accommodate how local, but also the others, proposed in an extremely constructive way. This solution was then proposed by the Unité des Communes Grand-Paradis as an answer to evident, concrete and immediate needs expressed by its territory, made even more evident by the recent alluvial event. This indication is identified as a temporary solution, a transitory solution, pending the appearance of the Arvier landfill, in a sort of relay, in which a period of time, relatively content, is assumed for the filling and for that environmental recovery that we all hope for the Pompiood site, in fact, to allow what is a redevelopment of the area in relatively content times. We then learned of a press release of some associations with the accusations of a not very transparent management, certainly a title that has a certain effect in the context of the Arpa studio, I believe that it is acceptable to express dissent and confront each other, but we strongly refer the accusations of little transparency to the sender, so we take note of the approach, but here we work on solutions, because deciding not to decide would be worse, Comparison, that search for sharing, not easy, with the various associations, but it must be said, the colleague aggravation often also says that the issue is not exclusive and reserved for someone, but it is good that other political forces, of which perhaps a different approach is appreciated, will face the matter. A phase 2 study, that of Arpa that, I repeat, be a technical study to support the management choices that follows, as I said, in the first part, where a sort of identity card of all the inert landfills present in the Aosta Valley was traced. Taking note of all this, phase 2 continues a path that aims to give solutions to the problem of management of the sidelines that involves the territory, local authorities, but above all also involves the entrepreneurial world, of which we must not forget and of all our region, a region that today, this must be remembered, exports two thirds of theert that produces outside the region. I have the feeling almost that annoys that the path made with Arpa can glimpse possible solutions, not easy solutions, but on which obviously we will work to get to the goal. The problem must therefore also be addressed by developing the activity of the recycling in parallel, we said it and we reiterate it with strength, the use of the deriving material, as done during the emergency of the flood of 29 and 30 June, with the reconstruction of the regional road of Cogne, with the insertion of the use of this material in the tender specifications of public works, as well as the territory asks us and also ask us for those companies. Finally, I remember that the regional law on associated services provides that this operation is managed operationally by local authorities in associated form. Coming to the questions, on the first question, the Arpa studio is, for what has been said in the introduction, an analysis that must first of all be made by local authorities, local authorities that have been the protagonists of the comparison, with constructive contributions, a pragmatic approach, a path that wants to reach solutions, objectives of a political action carried out by the regional administration and all the territories. Following a sharing by all 74 municipalities in our region, it can actually start what is defined as an operational phase, relating to the start of the actions necessary for its implementation. Technical-administrative process for its implementation depend on the management model, a management model that Celva, after the comparisons with the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta and its structures, will consider adopting with the availability of these regional offices to provide support and explain that coordination action which is provided for in article 16 of law 6/2014. As regards the second question, the procedures to be started because the Aymavilles-PompioD inert landfill becomes a public management landfill, they are also dependent on the management model that the system of local authorities, as I said, after the comparison and work in progress with the regional administration and with its structures, will consider adopting. A management system that will also involve all those sites that, having taken note of the new regulations, will go towards an environmental recovery, therefore we are not talking about closure for the other sites, but of an environmental recovery, considering the technical-economic non-sustainability that the two phases of Arpa study show us; Therefore a vision no longer only territorial, no more than the single municipality, but a regional vision that must be carried out to guarantee full sustainability and also of the interesting rates for the Valle d'Aosta entrepreneurial world. It is a difficult goal, it is an ambitious goal, but it is to resolve the critical issues also of the Pompiood website and that of the management of the sidelines in the region. As mentioned, we must work in order to be autonomous in the disposal of theert that we produce, encourage the reuse of the recycling material and implement all possible actions, in the context of our skills, in order to avoid transfer from outside the region and to give the territories involved the right and necessary guarantees of safety, which are in the heart of all of us. All this must be carried out for local authorities and together with them. The mayors, as well as the regional executive, govern territories that await responses and also concrete solutions, therefore a comparison is welcome, but that it is correct and constructive, just as it is with associations and with the environmental world, but that this is a comparison aimed at achieving concrete solutions that we must and want to reach."
48030,XVI,21/11/2024,"AMBIENTE, Stoccaggio e smaltimento rifiuti",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,6,3122,"You look at councilor, as she knows well, I am not a commissioner of the third commission, it is my colleague who, promptly, reported me what has been said and then I have the gift of understanding when I read, so I read both the minutes and the Arpa study, sincerely the fact that I was not present for once in a commission I hope I will be granted. In all this, councilor, a piece is missing, that I hoped that she would tell us today. Look in the road procedures that are at this moment under discussion in the Aosta Valley, we find the renewal of the Pompiood landfill, and everything she said, is promptly denied in that renewal. The Cers become 68 and among these we also find red sludge, industrial waste, we even find that the landfill is expected to be exhausted in ten years, in the renewal it is expected that it ends in three years. Then I wonder: it means that perhaps the waste will also come from outside, because from this point of view, who knows, perhaps this could happen too, but then I also had the time to analyze it, why I asked myself: but why do they continue to come to the audition and they don't tell us about this way? I thought you wouldn't know. Then I also put myself to study that road procedure. The derogations remain, so we have acts of the Prosecutor who tell us that that authorization, as it was done, does not exist, the derogations remain. As I said, 68 cer remain, therefore all the CERs that had not been authorized are considered authorized, because I remember that the only authorized are the eleven of the first landfill, of the first authorization, also closed and of which we know very well. I remembered that we are talking about two secure masses and what do we do? We press those who, in recent years, most likely that landfill has not managed it to the best. It is then stated that the competent authorities have excluded the existence of potential impacts deriving from the plant and even consider any further environmental verification superfluous. This reads in that renewal. Then I also leave others to read carefully, because, as you can imagine, there will be observations compared to that renewal, but I honestly wonder what we are talking about. The study says one thing, does not take into account the technical-administrative documents and, moreover, in the renewal procedure, we find something else. It seems to me that you are making fun of it, this is my impression. Compared to public management, he did not respond, in essence. Honestly - or then maybe it's my limit, I will ask and go to listen to me -, he did not tell me who will become the property of that landfill, or at least I have absolutely not understood. We will have a new hearing in the commission, we will talk about it again, so who knows that maybe someone does not deign to come to the commission and to illuminate us even compared to all these issues. Of course I invite colleagues who are part of the third commission to carefully read that route procedure."
48031,XVI,21/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità, Strade di interesse regionale",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,2,3874,"Let's go back to dealing with a theme that we can no longer allow us to ignore, a theme that concerns the quality of life of many Valley citizens. I'm talking about traffic problems on the regional road n. 20, in particular in the stretch between Gressan and Pont-Suaz. This stretch of road, every morning and every evening, turns into a long snake of blocked vehicles, with motorists forced to endure inconveniences that repeat themselves. The situation is well known to all of us, so much so that on 11 January 2024 we discussed a motion in this classroom, in which we asked for the activation of a work table with the municipalities of the Plaine, the regional council and the municipality of Aosta, to find a shared solution. Unfortunately, a little or nothing has been done since then, and this is not just a discomfort: every day hundreds of families see their lives conditioned by this problem. There are workers who arrive late, parents who struggle to bring their children to school on time, the elderly who cannot reach essential services without having to face interminable waiting times. In the morning, after 07, and in the afternoon on the return, the regional road n. 20 becomes a funnel where traffic paralyzes and everything seems to stop. Do we want to talk about the pollution that cause the cars still? And then let's talk about sustainability and green turning point. Among other things, it is not acceptable that in 2024 there are citizens who must sacrifice precious hours of their day due to an inefficient viability and interventions that, to date, remain only promises not kept. The reports, by Valley citizens, have been many, I also remember the various initiatives presented by the opposition forces. These are not simple complaints, they are shouting of help, life stories that every day have to deal with discomfort, stress. The long queues then mean not only waste of time, but also a dramatic increase in air pollution. Firm vehicles constantly emit harmful gases, worsening the quality of the air. We cannot therefore ignore the fact that this has a direct impact on the health of our fellow citizens, in particular of young people, children, the elderly. In addition, noise pollution, produced by the continuous shots of horn and by the noise of the engines, creates an unsustainable environment for those who live and work along this stretch of road. We are not only talking about a road problem, but of a real environmental and public health emergency. The discomfort translates into an increase in stress for those who are in the queue, a reduction of well -being for those who reside nearby and an increasingly negative perception of those who administer us. In 2018, with resolution no. 1680 of 28 December, the regional council had approved an action plan for environmental management on the regional road n. 20, calling it a main road axis. This recognition made hope for quick, effective interventions, but unfortunately we are still here to talk about the same problems. More than 3 million vehicles pass every year on that road, but, despite this alarming data, the concrete interventions remained only on paper. Where are the solutions that had been promised to citizens? So based on these considerations ... I ask for some silence, president, thanks, a little silence in the classroom, thanks. We therefore ask the regional government to find out what the actions and interventions have been in the field to resolve this important and impactful critical issues on the regional road n. 20 and which it intends to put in place to give a definitive solution to the traffic of the aforementioned section. From 6:12 pm the vice -president Paolo Sammaritani takes on the presidency."
48031,XVI,21/11/2024,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità, Strade di interesse regionale",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976.0,M,UV,4,5874,"The critical issues relating to circulation along the regional road n. 20, which is the subject of this interpellation, have already been discussed on several occasions in this advice, but we willingly return to the point, precisely to try to give punctual answers and renew those that are even concrete commitments. The major slowdowns are concentrated in the area between the roundabout and the Pont-Suaz location in the section of connection with the roadway to the city of Aosta and, as mentioned by the proposer, are determined in particular in some specific time slots of the working days. The response to these critical issues must intervene in different directions and involve more actors, certainly starting from the structures of the regional administration, but also the municipalities involved, in particular also the Municipality of Aosta. As for the solutions under the competence of the Region, the stretch between Gressan and Pont-Suaz, of the regional road n. 20, also taking into account the important vehicular traffic of over 3 million vehicles per year - remember: 3 million on this section, while it reaches 7 on the Pont -Suaz -, has been affected over the years by the realization of various interventions aimed precisely in the improvement of road safety through the construction of the various roundabouts, as well as by different pedestrian paths. This, as already mentioned and as discussed in the last council, on the occasion of a question by colleague Manfrin on road safety along the regional road 20. In this regard, I intend to reiterate the further possible roundabout on which we are comparing ourselves in La Borettaz locality, which can bring, as well as better access to the public and private areas of that location, certainly a clear improvement in the safety of that section. Furthermore, the regional road 20 was also affected, in the years 2021-2022 and during the current year 2024, by interventions to adjust the road flooring with bituminous conglomerate with low-absorbent acoustic emission, in implementation of the action plan for the management of the environmental noise of the regional road n. 20 of Gressan where, as we said, more than 3 million vehicles pass every year, in the specific case 3,980,000, as found as part of the acoustic mapping of the road in question. Taking into account the entity, therefore of the trafficking of this road, the municipalities of Gressan and Charvensod, also at the stress of the regional administration, have also removed the raised and positioned platforms in previous years, thus reducing the inconvenience to road users and the consequent noise the vehicular transit. Following the completion of the construction works of the main line of the methane entrance in the municipality of Gressan, in September of the current year, significant interventions of the road pavement have been carried out, also here with bituminous conglomerate for low -absorbent acoustic emission, in implementation of the action plan for the management of the environmental noise that we have recalled just a few, including the complete remaking of the horizontal signs and of the horizontal signs and of the pedestrian crossings. In October, the regional council also approved the updating of the action plan for the management of the environmental noise of the road in the subject of Gressan, defined as the main road axis, as a reconnaissance and explanatory tool of the further interventions to be carried out and planned in the next five years by the administration, in the context of the other planning and programmatic tools. Taking into account also the positive results obtained, it has been foreseen to repavy further stretches of the road, always with the same conglomerate, to always go to limit what is the acoustic impact. Finally, in the coming months the start of the procedures for the assignment of a preliminary study of the overall roads in the territorial area of ​​the Plaine and ENVERS, which therefore identifies the possible solutions for the resolution of the critical issues that affect the regional road 20 of Gressan, as well as the other regional roads that converge at the crucial node of the Pont-Suaz, is scheduled. A study that will be complex and articulated, but that can already give us data in its intermediate phase. On the front of the concrete solutions to the problem of traffic along the stretch of Gressan/Pont-Suaz road, the Regional Administration will be able to carry out its assessments and also start the consequent interlocations with the Conseil de la Plaine and with the municipalities involved following the acquisition of the aforementioned study; The Conseil de la Plaine that we had already mentioned on the occasion of a previous initiative which is, in fact, the organ with which we confront constantly. The importance of an action shared with the city of Aosta - and also returns here on a topic already treated - starting from the solutions of the node of the reunification of the paravera and valleys Valley, of the connection between the city center and the F8 area: a great challenge, a great project that must be carried out; This could relieve a part of the traffic that is currently channeled along via I Maggio. At the same time, it is also necessary to deepen the reasoning on the opportunity and placement of a possible new bridge, which is not easy to imagine, but, starting from the comparison of the solutions relating to the internal connections of the city of Aosta, to which I referred before, and starting from the involvement of the Conseil de la Plaine parallel. Therefore, first these reasoning, the outcome of the study, the comparison with the Conseil de la Plaine, the action on the Municipality of Aosta, and then make the consequent reasoning."

Obviously the critical issues have already been discussed in various advice but, I repeat them, no solution has been adopted today. Among other things, the problem is not linked to speed in that section, so no speed cameras or policemen are needed with the palette, because there the flow is increasingly abundant, so about a year has passed since the presentation of my initiative, but nothing has changed, that is, on paper perhaps yes, but I always see people, Valle d'Aosta, glued from 07 onwards, from 17 to 18. Growing up: nothing has changed. 30-40 minutes to do 1 kilometer, it seems a bit excessive to me. What can I say? I can give you solutions that could solve this problem. One also mentioned her: to create a double sense of circulation in the stretch of road in via Paravera; This could be a solution, even nearby with the intersection of via Giorgio Carrel, which is currently one -way. This solution would perhaps allow you to decongest, in part, traffic. The other instead establish alternate unique senses; This could be a temporal solution, to manage traffic more efficiently. So, treasure these solutions and take note of them, because those who represent us have a duty to do everything possible to improve the quality of life of our citizens. I only see many words, but the facts are very few. Among other things, we also leave the great works in the drawer for the moment, or rather, the construction of a new bridge that perhaps would be the best solution. So two proposals were made, I would also like to remember, and the colleague Baccega reminded me, it must be taken into account that the winter season will soon start and therefore also in that area, there will be an increase in tourists who will go to the well -known ski resort. Do you, councilor, we told him. I, I was in her, I would worry a little."
48032,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,3661,"We left each other in December last year with a press release of the majority forces. I also remember it with a little nostalgia, because a year ago we had left with a proposal on our part - which was to give more money for health attractiveness, extending this attractiveness also to socio -health workers who had been shamefully excluded - and a response from the majority that said to us: ""No, well, we have to be asphalted, that money cannot be touched, but waiting for us, communicated, that curiously I have been looking for days, because it came out on the information bodies, but the media had made it disappear, and so I had to go to recover it on the region's website; I don't know why the media have made this press release disappear. This press release, at the end of the debate, I remember that we presented the amendment to extend it, said: ""At the end of the regulatory process dedicated to health professions, the majority wants to highlight attention to all the other operators, in particular for social-health workers (OSS). There is the awareness that the necessary contractual attention of their professions must find the right enhancement in the next negotiations and adaptations"". This happened a year ago. Cyclically, as the commissioner Marzi will remember, we asked, on several occasions, to go to allocate the due awards to the staff and the social-health workers who remained excluded from the attractiveness allowance, and repeatedly we were told: ""We are doing it, we already do it, we have already done it, we will do it tomorrow, yesterday I had judo, I do it this afternoon"" and we arrived at today, the day in which the socio-health workers still did not have had any contractual adaptations. In the face of this, it is clear that, rightly, those who have faced, like the others, the pandemic, but above all those who are part of a category, such as that of the socio-health operators, which is the one that has fallen in greatest number ... you will remember, councilor, will remember this classroom, the table on what are the numbers of the health figures that are present in the structure, in our region: among the doctors, nurses and socio-health workers, the category. After having fallen, it is that of socio-health operators. Now, this measure of attractiveness has been made, which in reality has become a maintenance measure, and therefore allowed to reduce the escape, in some cases we have been said that instead it was also possible to make a greater number of people participate in the competitions, in the calls that are made. However, the figures of socio-health operators are clearly excluded. This is why, with this interpellation, councilor, we ask you if it is intention to comply with the commitments made towards social-health operators and figures excluded from the health allowance measure and whether it is intention to identify the resources necessary to avoid the announced cuts to the health allowance of the figures other than doctors and nurses. On this we will also have the opportunity to speak with the motion of the colleague remain, I do not think that we will be able to discuss it today, but surely sooner or later we will discuss it and on the occasion of that motion we will also speak of the cuts that have been made to the health attractiveness allowance that at first has been granted and then here too, the money with the elastic, first I give you, I promise you, and then I withdraw them back."
48032,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6440,"Coming to the question n. 1 of interpellation 45, that is, if it is intention to comply with the commitments made to the social -health operators and the figures excluded from the health allowance measure, I just reinoltered - I think it will be enthusiastic - the press release of last year. As regards the RAR, i.e. the regional additional resources, in relation to the provisions of regional law no. 12/2024, the USL company started the company's supplementary bargaining with trade union organizations, taking into account the regional objectives of the activities to be carried out. In fact, the identification of the secondary objectives and the detailed methods of payment and the times of disbursement of the RARs, in fact, of the regional additional resources, which are also based on the hours actually rendered, are deducted to company bargaining. The first decisions in this regard were shared between the USL company and the trade union organizations during the following meetings: for the health sector on 21 October 2024; for professional, technical and administrative management on 23 October 2024; For the Health Area management on 30 October 2024. Specifically, having to operate a distinction for the single contractual table for the concrete implementation of the provisions of the law, a first hypothesis of agreement was signed for the health sector sector on 5 November 2024; The hypothesis of an agreement with the signing of all the parties involved and for the management of the health area, at the moment there is still no draft hypotheses shared for the signing of all the parties is being perfected. As regards the healthcare sector and the technical-administrative professional management, as part of the agreements, the start has been established from 1 November 2024 to carry out the additional hours. I say this because, independently of the rightly political positions and the debate that is there, it is absolutely important to take the opportunity - and I believe that this will also please you - to reassure the workers involved because, in fact, it is also right to remember that once the laws are made, as regards this type of application, the ball passes to the unions and the company that, in fact, with a specific of the dates that I have also shown them, working in this sense. Coming to the question n. 2 - which, as she recalled, is also the subject of another initiative -, as we have already had the opportunity to clarify in response to an initiative on the same point discussed during the regional council of last November 7, with the regional law no. 27/2023, for the three-year period 2023-2025, a temporary health allowance for all non-medical, veterinary and health professions, for the staff of the health professions of the Healthcare sector, obviously, of obviously, of the nursing staff who already benefited from the allowances referred to in Law 22/2022, was scheduled for the three-year period. This law also expanded the allowance to all healthcare personnel, including that of regional law 22, also with the part -time employment relationship. The overall financial burden of that law had been determined for the three -year period 2023-2025 in annual € 2,700,000, according to the counts provided by the competent structures of the USL company, counts that had taken inspiration from a political action, then shared and concluded by the Government and the Council together, which had started precisely from a law proposal -among other things, the signing colleagues of this initiative were also the colleagues of the proposed law - bill 95 of 10 March 2023. The proposal, so important to arrive at the allowance provided for by law 27/2023, provided for in article 1, paragraph 2, a lower allowance than that currently perceived. Following the approval of the law itself, the USL company, to which in fact it is up to the trade union organizations, the company's supplementary bargaining, has started the bargaining itself, establishing, in full agreement with the union representatives, to proceed to provide instead of the beneficiary staff of 27/2023 the same amounts referred to in the law of attractiveness 22/2022, and therefore higher amounts compared to the proposed law 95, Law 27/2023, thus agreeing with the almost certainty of proceeding in a negative adjustment, by the end of the year, in order to respect the total amount of the loan (€ 2,700,000), which was calibrated on lower figures. In recent months, the company is therefore proceeding with the expected and predictable negative adjustments. It is therefore not a reduction in the temporary health allowance, but of an ordinary accounting operation provided for in the context of the agreements between the company and the unions. As regards the next budget for the three-year period 2025-2027, in consideration of the persistence of the lack of healthcare personnel, essential to ensure the health services and the activities provided for by the essential levels of assistance, the Department has already provided for the necessary legal proposals, as well as the due appropriations on the budget chapters, in order to provide that temporary health indemnities, and for the regional law 22/2022 that for the Reg Ried Law € 29/2023 and until 12/2024 - which is the subject of the first application for this posting - will also be asked for the annuity 202, in this way, for the figures provided for by these three, there will be € 8,5,500,000 the funds made available for all the workers of the Aostactian health workers starting from 2022, for the entities, for the entities, as the main claim, such as the main claim, as the subjects, will be available for the figures provided for the tax buds, as the provision workers. 27/2023, as we have already communicated on the occasion of the response to question no. 57 of the colleague remain discussed during the regional council of 7 November last, our commitment is aimed at updating the temporary health allowance referred to in the regional law 27/2023, leading to stabilizing the amounts from 2025 and to return to give the same figure for both cases, therefore 800 euros for gross envelope for the staff of the non -medical health management and 350 euros for gross envelope for the staff of the health professions."

Each press release and subsequent fried air have nothing more than trying to divert attention to the fact that those people, who those operators, the same ones who were incented when they were absolutely necessary, were however tragically ignored. Now she replied, councilor, a very interesting thing, but as a habit, she did it in a very technical and very quick way, and then I prefer to read it in a quieter, so that everyone understands what this wonderful world of the RARs that you have made available, because I already tell you immediately that obviously the staff of the social-health operators is very angry. Do you know why? He knows it very well, because to all the figures you have included for the attractive allowance, the allowance is recognized at the end of the month in the paycheck and these people do exactly what they did before. It is called attractive allowance because you do something and you are recognized a surplus, right? And this should allow operators of other regions to say: ""Do you know that there is? In the Aosta Valley you are better, let's go there because we take more"" or trivially, as has also been said during the discussion, it was also something to thank for the work done the staff who work in our health. Do you know what this beautiful proposal that you did with the USL does? Well, if for all the figures there are, for all the figures to whom you have guaranteed the indemnity of attractiveness, the pennies reach at the end of the month without having to do anything, however, for socio-health workers it is not so. Social-health operators obliged them to work more, that is, the proposal is: we give you the extra allowance if you work more. And thanks to the piffer or any other metaphorical tool! Of course if I work more I take more, but this seems to me the naturalness and normality of things. But no, you introduce you as a great conquest, ""we made a great conquest, that is, we said a bats in 2023, we will also recognize your salary, we will recognize everything"" and then what happened? Nothing, indeed, make fun of them, the workers, because the workers feel around, I guarantee you with lemon. I would not do the triumphalist so much, but, on the other hand, it must be said that precisely to celebrate this year spent with the teasing, today a press release has arrived that celebrates the great effort, not of all, not his, councilor, this I must recognize him, not of the councilor Carre, not of the councilor Guichardaz, not of many forces - and I apologize to the colleague Cretier if we call them a democratic party, I do not say that ABLE, I say Democratic Party and that's okay -, Pour the autonomies and how many others, because in reality it is the Union Valdôtaine. I read today's press release: ""Over 36 million for healthcare personnel, Union Valdôtaine guarantees what the national government denies"", that is, the money has given you the Union Valdôtaine, she had it in her pocket somewhere, she has been fine and said: ""Wait, there are 36 million, we give you for health personnel"". Then perhaps, since we had made the calculations, next time you should ask if they have a few million more at the Union Valdôtaine, you make you give any more, since they have it, and you can recognize the indemnity of attractiveness also to the staff who has widely deserved it. Otherwise continue to make fun of people, continue to make fun of the workers and the workers will be eternally grateful to you."
48033,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,2,6399,"For the second consecutive year, the Regional USL company will activate from November, if it has not already done so, the immunization campaign to protect infants from any respiratory complications linked to the syncial respiratory virus, one of the main causes of bronchiolitis that can affect children especially in the first months of life. We have the opportunity to read in the press release ""Bronchiolitan immunization campaign in Valle d'Aosta"" with date 28 October, sent to all the regional councilors, which I received as you on e -mail, by the Comilva Valle d'Aosta Association and Valle d'Aosta Futura, that ""prophylaxis will be administered to all new born directly in the hospital before the discharge, using Nersevimab, produced by AstraZeneca and marketed by Sanofi, who is not a vaccine, but is a monoclonal antibody that, as such, can have adverse effects. I would like to recall, to the managers of the Valle d'Aosta health care, including the commissioner, the results of three controlled randomized studies and the residence of data of the clinical studies of Astrazeneca and Sanofi, that is, the manufacturer and distributor of this drug, advertised by a magazine, Med Check, where it is highlighted that the healthy infants, treated with this drug Nersevimab, had a higher rate of mortality, probably probably, probably linked to adverse effects, including thrombosis, caused by the drug itself. The article ends with a worrying warning: ""Nersevimab should not be used in any newborn, not even for universal immunization"". The matter worries the right -thinking, in particular, because the unfavorable opinion was also expressed by the president of the Higher Institute of Italian Healthcare, Rocco Bellantone, who, who intervened following the resolution adopted by the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region - to administer to all infants before resignation from the neonatal department the antorpo - declared that ""the drug showed a modest effect in terms of the reduction of the ospine"" And, not being completely free of risks, the decision to administer it to the whole neonatal population does not seem to be justified. ""I repeat, this is not a terraciattista, it is not even a Novax, it is, I repeat, the president of the Higher Institute of Italian Healthcare; then everyone thinks as they want. I highlight that the international and state guidelines recommend, for some specific categories of children to increase in serious illness ( Preterine, or in the presence of congenital neoomusular pathologies, immunodeficiency, the presence of serious tracheo-bronchial malformations), the use of the drug instead Pallivizumab. In fact, the most well -known pharmacological treatment for bronchiolitis is Pallivizumab, a monoclonal antibody that has as a target the syncial respiratory virus, approved back in 2002 for its preventive effectiveness in high risk infections, including premature babies. What happens? Which today is replaced with Nrsevimab, the one that is used in the Aosta Valley, which is nothing more than the commercial name of the Beyfortus, a new monoclonal antibody produced by Astrazeneca and much more expensive. The price is between 282 euros in Spain, 1,350 euros in Germany and France is traveled on 400 euros the dose; I don't know Valley prices. Considering that almost all infants are infected within the first three years of age, most of them heal without treatment, since those who risk more a serious form of illness are precisely the children I said above. From the statements of the Councilor for Health Marzi in 2022, there were 51 children hospitalized in the Valle d'Aosta hospital, ""from an organizational point of view it affects our hospital in a very strong way"", the commissioner had the opportunity to say, ""and of course constitutes concern for families"". Please note that bronchiolitis prophylaxis is scheduled for all infants and children in the first year of life and has been integrated in the essential levels of additional regional assistance. The administration will be free, it will be proposed to parents, it is not mandatory and for parents it is essential to inquire adequately and correctly to exercise a conscious choice, that takes into account the risk-benefit relationship. The government is therefore asked to find out if the regional health structure provides for correct information towards all parents who will have to submit their children to prophylaxis, in particular how during the last season the parents have been adequately informed about the risks and benefits of the treatment, thus obtaining how much waste to the treatment. The second question is in compliance with the precautionary principle: if it is not considered necessary to suspend the administration of the Nrsevimab for all infants until the detailed studies of follow -up are conducted on the safety profile of this monoclonal antibody, as it is essential to obtain a picture as comprehensive as possible of what may be the problems highlighted during its experimentation. Point 3: If you do not intend to practice the pharmacological treatment with better and less expensive monoclonal antibodor, used until last year, on behalf of Palivizumab, recommended by the international guidelines for the specific categories of affected children and if the health management has somehow analyzed the results I spoke of before the three randomized studies controlled of Astrazeneca and Sanofi. I add a fourth question, councilor, if you like to answer unscheduled, since he keeps press conferences, so he will surely be able to answer me. A simple simple question, that is, if the injections intended for newborns in the first days of life are also carried out in Aosta, while clinical studies are mainly conducted than on age groups of older children."
48033,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,9353,"Thanks President and above all thanks connects Lucianaz, because - in fact - this is the only political initiative of the day. Coming to the last, I anticipate the non -answer to the fourth question, because of course - as you know - they are absolutely not in the condition to understand what he asked and therefore not even to answer them .... no, but even if he repeats it, it is not a question of hearing, it is a cognitive, competent, ability. Our region was the first region in Italy, together with other countries such as France, the United States and Canada, to approve the prophylaxis of bronchiolitis from syncial respiratory viruses, that is, the RSV. With resolution 1307, in fact, of a year ago, of 13 November 2023, we governed prophylaxis in the context of the regional additional Lea, therefore against the regional health service, obtaining excellent health results in the last winter season. The prophylaxis campaign has in fact significantly reduced the hospital hospitalization of small patients. The hospitalizations were more than halved: from 4 February 2024 there were 19 cases against the 49 recorded in the same period of the previous season, with a reduction of 62% of hospitalizations. We inform, among other things, that in this period a heated comparison is underway between the Italian regions for the supply of the drug, which is limited in its production. Given the effectiveness that the campaign has shown, today all regions hope to be able to guarantee its small clients the prophylaxis of bronchiolitis which is practiced in the Aosta Valley. In light of all this, it is curious that while in other regions the controversy rages because it is not easily able to supply the drug, and therefore the administration plans go slowly, in our region, on the contrary, a suspension of prophylaxis is solicited with this initiative; prophylaxis which, as mentioned above, has returned very positive results, causing objective benefits to the health of young patients and guaranteeing clinicians to be able to work with serenity, without access to access to the pediatric emergency room and the pediatric ward. In fact, considering the current small equipment of pediatric doctors, that is, four units plus a part -time, therefore four and a half, a further influx to the pediatric emergency room would be at the expense of the correct management of ordinary activities. Among other things, it is important to make these connections because then initiatives come where they ask us why, in fact, the situation in the prompt help is this, including the pediatric one. Coming to the question n. 1 - that is, if the regional health structure provides for correct information towards all parents who will have to submit their children, etc., the USL company specifies that all the parents of the children, obviously candidates for prophylaxis, receive an information written on the risks and benefits of the treatment early and at the time of the administration of the drug, of course, an interview with a pediatrician is expected, available to provide more information and clarifications. Last season, the children undergoing prophylaxis with Nersevimab were 440 and none of them was hospitalized for bronchiolitis by syncial respiratory viruses. The operators of the public hygiene and public health service of the USL company, two or three weeks after treatment, have however contacted the parents of all children undergoing prophylaxis to detect if there had been adverse reactions following the administration of the drug. 90% of parents reported they have not detected anything, about 5% about a feverish reaction and about 5% a local reaction; Mild transient manifestations for which no parent has had to resort to the pediatrician. Instead, we come to what happened compared to the fact that 175 children whose parents did not join prophylaxis last season: among these children, 17 (therefore 10%) were hospitalized for serious forms of bronchiolite by RSV. We come to question no. 2, the nursevimab monoclonal antibody is not in the experimental phase. Therefore that of the procedure that we apply free within this region, first in Italy, has been approved by the European Agency for Medicines at European level and by the Italian drug agency at national level, with the prior evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of the drug, through a correct analysis of the reference studies before its issue on the market. Considered the enormous benefits in terms of reducing the incidence and hospitalization for bronchiolitis by syncial respiratory viruses, in light of the studies conducted so far and also by the data relating to the last prophylaxis campaign in our region, it is considered necessary to offer prophylaxis with Nersevimab, and therefore the current drug. We also recall the benefits of prophylaxis that reduced the hospital hospitalizations of young patients by 62% and, in fact, the fact that, compared to the 400 children subjected to this prophylaxis, in last season no one was in fact hospitalized for bronchiolitis. As anticipated in the introduction, we also confirm that our region is considered, in the interregional tables that deal with this topic in these days, one of the most virtuous and quick regions to offer their small patients this possibility that, we reiterate, is voluntary membership, as recalled also by her. We add that on 17 October 2024 the state-regions intended on the document ""activity for the universal access of infants to passive immunization against the respiratory virus"" has been approved, which has defined a minimum target of subjects who can access the monoclonal drug, as the activity is considered a public health priority. Obviously, it is believed to be such why, as recalled earlier, if the ready pediatric rescue rescue clogs, in fact, the activity of the pediatricians is limited which are few in all Italy. In the premises of this document, the reasons for the importance of the use of passive immunization with the syncial respiratory virus are explicit, as this virus is considered one of the main causes of serious respiratory infection in children under two years with potentially fatal consequences for babies and premature. Regarding the security, the document just fired reports the effectiveness and safety of Nersevimab (i.e. the drug that is administered in the Aosta Valley): they have been confirmed by clinical studies that demonstrate a significant reduction in the hospitalization related to the RSV, in healthy and preterm infants. In addition, technological progress has made it possible to overcome the limits of previous therapies, such as Pallivizumab, which required monthly administrations. The single administration of Nersevimab, offered before the peak season of the ERV, facilitates universal coverage, making it more sustainable for both families and health systems. As part of the same State-Regions agreement, which has expanded the possibility for all regions to resort to this service, an interregional control cabin has been provided to coordinate the inoculation campaign between the regions due to the scarcity of availability of the drug following the opening given to the aforementioned agreement. Having said that, I would like to say that the choice made by the regional government last season 2023-2024 is anticipatory compared to what is being carried out today at national level and, among other things, we had anticipated this even when we had talked about this initiative last year. This action today guarantees an supply of the drug that allows the USL Valley company to propose the drug to the parents of all the small Aosta Valley patients born from 1 April 2024, target, among other things, much wider than that provided for by the State-Regions agreement in question attracted by me. Coming to the question n. 3, the pharmacological treatment with the previous monoclonal antibody (what she proposes) was reserved only for children with specific risk factors, precisely because of the high cost for each dose and the need for at least five doses per child, one per month, for each epidemic season, in the face of a single administration of the drug that is proposed in the Aosta Valley, sufficient to protect children for the entire epidemic season. The statement that the drug proposed is less expensive is sensationally incorrect, as a dose of the drug she proposed costs about three times compared to the one we offer in the Aosta Valley and there are five doses for each child in the epidemic season. Therefore, a cycle of treatment with its drug is fifteen times more expensive than we propose in the Aosta Valley. Finally, we reiterate that the analysis of clinical studies is not the competence of the health management of the USL Valdostana company, but the bodies proposed to the authorization and introduction of the drugs, the EMA and the AIFA already mentioned on the market, which guarantee the safety of patients."

So we had asked a whole series of questions and problems ranging from taking charge at the level of relational and information support to that of financial support. The demanding approved of the motion provided that, within 90 days, the Regional Government verified, together with the medical management of the Unit of the USL company, the effects produced by the Regional Council Resolution 825/2023, which had been established to take charge of the situations, including this too; And therefore one year after his launch, from his adoption, to take stock of the situation to understand which was the state of satisfaction from the user and, possibly, on what measures would have been consequently to be undertaken to give coverage to the needs of citizens who, despite themselves, find themselves living this difficult situation."

For the most part, these are the expenses incurred which are, following the checks carried out, equal to an amount of about 3,500 euros in 2023 and of approximately 17,000 euros in 2024. Therefore, after the company and the Department checks, from the checks carried out it appears that reimbursements were carried out for an amount of about 3,500 euros in 2023 and approximately 17,000 euros in 2024 minimal the overall expenditure for the reimbursement of residence expenses. The proposing structures are mostly the structure of pediatrics and neonatology and the structure of child neuropsychiatry; Other structures involved are dermatology, internal medicine and ophthalmology. The structures outside the valley to which the patients have turned out to be located mainly in Piedmont and Lombardy. From the analysis carried out on the data, and from the first assessments made, it appears that different organizational actions are implemented for a more effective implementation of the provisions contained in the resolution in question. Among these, the enhancement of the internal internal communication also includes also in order to: 1) give greater prominence to the possibilities offered by the current regional provisions; 2) to make the different care needs more effective and more efficient. The development and enhancement of internal communication constitutes, among other things, one of the management objectives of the USL company for the year 2025 within the strategic area programming and management of instrumental and human economic resources; therefore, already given in this sense. The actions that could improve the organizational accompaniment of families will also be subject to further assessments that will be carried out with the new director of the complex structure, medical direction of garrison (or DMP), for which the structure in November concluded the process of carrying out the selection for the attribution of the assignment, in order to naturally - this new assignment - to strengthen the current activity carried out by the medical management of the garrison - Doctor who previously played this role - as an information point or first contact in this area. At the organizational level inside the USL company, in order to facilitate users, the company has identified the secretariat of the medical management of garrison as an information point and/or first contact for an assessment of merit about the eligibility and reimbursement of expenses in question. More precisely, the Secretariat of the Medical Directorate of Presidium currently acts as a counter for the client who needs to have confirmation that the performance he needs is qualified as eligible, pursuant to the resolution of the regional council 825/2023. The current procedure provides that, if the client is already in charge of the Regional Health Service and is already inserted in Cura di Cura Out of Valley, the medical management of the garrison is charged to contact the competent specialist of the USL company for the possible issue of the necessary prescription, validated by the director of the competent health facilities. In the event that the assistance is aimed for the first time at the USL company for the purpose of having access to the services that will have to qualify as not supplied to the Valley Regional Health Service, the DMP (or medical management of garrison) takes care of promoting contact with the competent specialist of the USL Valley company so that the client may have a consultation and, if necessary, can proceed with the cure of the valley. For the purposes of submitting the reimbursement of expenses referred to in the resolution of the Regional Council 825/2023. I read the final part that I hope will satisfy the right request: in order to strengthen the organizational accompaniment of the families, a possible enhancement of the activity carried out so far by the medical management of the garrison will therefore be examined and the interventions to be put in place and any changes to be made to the DGR 825/2023 will also be assessed.

48034,XVI,21/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,6,4146,"I must say that today I find myself satisfied with the answer, councilor, who gave this interpellation, because it substantially recognizes that this is a problem to be addressed, which is a problem felt by people, by Valley citizens, but which probably does not yet have a taking charge as it should be. Certainly, only the reimbursement data on 2023, which says that 3500 euros have been reimbursed, tells that the Aosta Valley population is not even aware of this possibility; And above all, it is not those who find themselves from one day to the next in a situation of objective difficulty, when perhaps he is announced a bad diagnosis and that he must organize himself immediately to manage a transfer operation outside the valley and, as she has had the opportunity to say, and how we had already had the opportunity to highlight in the presentation of the motion, it is above all of cases where there are children in tender age, therefore of young families who cannot refer, most of the times, to a social protection. familiar when they are perhaps in situations already of fragility or economic difficulty. I can guarantee that I had the opportunity to speak with families whose parent, one of the two parents, said: ""I had to sleep in the car I down to Turin for several evenings because there was no alternative, we had no possibilities"". Just as we believe that it is a hand to the discussion of the contribution: a contribution cannot be made after 3-4 months to a situation where there is a need for immediate cash, because the problem then concrete is this, because where there are reimbursements then to follow, it means that the penny was there, and that all in all the difficulty has been able to manage it and overcome it. This is one of the problems, but, often and willingly, we have had the opportunity to grasp the reading of a great distance between those who provide the service and between those who should be the beneficiary in the discussion of our initiatives. Therefore, in the light of the fact that you said that there is a need to take charge of this situation to implement the actions that, in our opinion, do not remain only exclusively linked to the economic sphere, but also to the sphere of taking the problem and the accompaniment to the management of the difficulties that the family one day to day must be found to face, in our opinion it is important, in this phase here, also having a relationship with the associations on those who are the beneficiaries. We should begin to hear these families and ask them what are the problems they encountered, because these initiatives that we have made arise from these experiences that we have been able to listen to. This is the work you need to do, because otherwise solutions are drawn which then do not fulfill what should be the needs. Therefore, for what we can do as regional councilors, we would ask you that this topic, to which we keep a lot, at a certain point be brought to the commission to be able to evaluate what are the proposals that are advanced and possibly be able to audire the subjects who are the beneficiaries of the initiative to try to give a concrete solution, which can improve what are the experiences that have been made to date; Experiences that cannot be, in the public body, leave in the hands of the sensitivity of the individual operator. We believe that they should be proceducted, because otherwise, most of the time, there is not even awareness of the offer of a service; If maybe that day there or that week the operator is on vacation, what he was busy and who knew this procedure well, who replaces him is not able to indicate what the roads to go are well. Therefore, we take note of the response, we appreciated the availability and trust that there is also an involvement of the regional council, through its joints, to arrive to define the update of this resolution of the council."

Industrial of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy the registration of the ""Cuore"" tourist promotional trademark and the ""Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"" logo. The next step will concern the start of the comparison with all the regional structures, the entities and the subjects who, in various capacities, must be involved to build the process that could bring the ""heart"" tourist promotion brand to become the regional ""umbrella brand"". Taking into account the current problems relating to the registration of the brands of a well -known tourist location in our region - and we also remember that in the past, regarding the ownership of the brands, some problems had been generated for the Valle d'Aosta region -, therefore we believe that it is very important to have to protect the image, promotion and enhancement of our region at best through the necessary registration actions of all the various brands and logos of competence related to the activity of the regional administration. We highlight that the start and definition of the various registration process of the brands and logos, starting from the creation of the same, would be strategic in order to resolve the birth of possible critical issues, therefore also avoiding disputes that could request the commitment of financial resources by the regional administration. The councilor competent is asked to get to know how many and what are all the brands of competence and regional interest, if all the brands and logos mentioned in the first question have been recorded since their creation or subsequently, if there are still some unregistered brands or logos, if there is the intention to proceed as soon as possible at the start of the necessary process, with the aim of avoiding possible future critical issues and at the same time to better protect the various sectors of our Region. Finally, I would also add the latest problems that have been generated, if there is the intention to raise awareness of the attention on the subject also all those realities that, in some way, affect and involve the image of the region, despite the brands and logos are not directly of regional property. I just want to conclude this presentation by asking the commissioner if about the third question, where I ask if there are still brands that maybe they are not registered, to perhaps avoid problems, if you can mention the number, without mentioning them, and maybe then I would ask you if you can provide me with the paper response in order to analyze it, in order to avoid possible critical issues."
48035,XVI,21/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, INFORMAZIONE, TURISMO E INDUSTRIA ALBERGHIERA",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,6382,"Yes, I will provide you with the answer and, listening to her, she will find the trademarks in the various councilors registered or not registered for the reasons I will tell them. With reference to the first question, a reconnaissance was carried out at the departments public works, territory and environment, economic development, work training, transport and sustainable mobility, agriculture and natural resources, cultural assets and activities, educational system and policies for intergenerational relationships, from which it emerged what I am illustrating. As regards the tourism, sports and commerce department, there are two brands: the tourism promotion brand, ""Cuore"" brand, which she reported in its premise, and the ""Balteus"" brand, Balteo journey. As regards the first, it is highlighted that the deposit made in 2023, functional to the registration at the ""Cuore"" brand patents and brands and the ""Valle d'Aosta-Vallée d'Aoste"" brand, already in use for several years, ended during the month of June 2024, precisely on June 18, 2024, with registration. As regards the second, it should be noted that the ""Balteus"" brand, a Balteo journey, owned by the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, was created with the aim of identifying and promoting the circular hiking route called ""Camino Balteo"", as part of the strategic project ""Bassa via della Valle d'Aosta"". The trademark was recorded at the Italian Patents and trademarks of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy for a period of 10 years starting from February 7, 2022 The first brand is the identification of the Natura Valle d'Aosta system, conceived in the context of a project financed by the FESR operating program, regional competitiveness 2007-2013. The project was aimed at creating a unitary system that could represent the image of the nature of the Aosta Valley and ensure a conscious use, providing for the promotion, research and monitoring activities. The ""Viva Valle d'Aosta Valley, unique by nature"" brand, conceived in the context of the communication actions of the project, responds to the need to promote the character of uniqueness of the Valley naturalistic offer, making it recognizable as an expression of the naturalistic and regional traditional typicality, in particular underlining the character of sustainability as an essential and characterizing element of the offer of green tourism. The brand and the related user manual have been approved by resolution of the Regional Council n. 1806 on 29 July 2011. Subsequently, the first registration was carried out, expired on December 15, 2021, which was then renewed in 2022 for an additional ten years, until 15 December 2031. The logo of the brand ""Regional Museum of Natural Sciences Efisio Noussan-Saint-Pierre Castle"" was designed as part of the Interreg Italia-Francia 2014-2020 cooperation project that partially financed the project of the project Restoration and rearrangement of the Saint-Pierre Castle, home of the Regional Museum of Natural Sciences. With resolution of the junta n. 350 of 22 March 2019, the brand and logo of the visual identity of the Regional Museum of Natural Sciences Efisio Noussan were approved. At present, the trademark has not yet been recorded, but the opportunity to record the museum logo, identifying the museum itself, is being evaluated. As for the other departments, connects, if it agrees, I would only mention the names, then I give you the answer so that you can check which they are registered and which are not. As far as competence of the Economic Development Department, the ""La Saint Ours"" brand, the ""Coa"" brand, the ""Coalab"" brand, the ""Beauclimat"" brand and the brand ""Info Energia Chez Chez Nous"" are reported. Then there are the ""Artisanà"" trademark of competence of AVAT, the ""Pear"" brand which distinguishes the regional energy plan and ""Cit Vda"", the thermal plants cadastre that have not been recorded. Some logos are used at the Labor Policies Department, including ""VDA works"". As far as the Agriculture Department was responsible, the ""Marché Au Forte"" brand was recorded, an initiative scheduled in the second weekend of October in Bard, which in 2024 reached its twentieth edition. For other initiatives and events organized by the Promotion Office of the Department, there are no specific brands or logos. The Department then recorded, since its creation, the ""Route des Vins Vallée d'Aoste"" brand in 1989 for twenty years and subsequent ten-year renewals in the years 2009- 2019. The Superintendence Department for Cultural Heritage and Activities conceived the ""Valle d'Aosta Heritage"" brand which was recorded in the .it, .eu E.org domains. As for the second question, of all the brands that I have listed, have been recorded since their creation, or subsequently, the tourist promotion trademark (as I told her, was recorded on June 18, 2024), the ""Balteus"" trademark (I told him), the ""Viva"" trademark (for now it is not registered, but we are thinking of recording the logo). For the third question, the recording of a brand has the fundamental purpose of creating a monopoly of its use, therefore prohibiting its use for third parties or preventing thirds from taking advantage of the created brand. In addition, the registration allows you to attack anyone who proceeds to the filing of an identical or similar brand to that recorded through an opposition procedure. The registration of a trademark is not always appropriate or necessary for the costs that can also involve and above all of a management nature. During the answer to the first question, the one in which I listed all the brands, information was provided regarding the regional brands not registered with respect to which an evaluation is underway. Now I provide them with the answer so that it can have the detail of those I have, in some cases, only summarily listed."
48035,XVI,21/11/2024,"COMMERCIO, INFORMAZIONE, TURISMO E INDUSTRIA ALBERGHIERA",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978.0,M,RV,6,1708,"I thank the commissioner for this long very technical response, obviously we expected it because we talk about logos, data, recordings and therefore it is normal that it is so. Thank you to provide us with the answer so you can analyze it better. This initiative was born from the fact, as we all know, from the critical issues that in recent months have been born and therefore precisely to try to go to the topic, treat it and try, perhaps, from delays or errors made in the past, try not to commit them, because then many times we see that, in the face of an expense of perhaps 300-400-500 euros of recordings, then after maybe things can become more serious, so it was just a bit. What would perhaps be important, although here too it is not the responsibility, as I said in the premises, perhaps of the regional administration, given what is happening, and since perhaps there are many sectors that perhaps not directly of regional competence, but where indirectly the image of some logos, brands or denominations can still affect and influence what is the appearance and visibility of the image of the Region of the Aosta Valley, perhaps try to sensitize these realities. On what is the importance of the recordings of these brands and these logotypes, precisely to avoid certain critical issues that then, as we all know, sometimes one acts in good faith and then unfortunately not all are so and therefore many times then you have to chase the operations or the process that are very difficult and very expensive. This is only to pay attention to the interest of the image of our region."
48037,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,2,3717,"I would say that, at the end of our day, we are going to face a fairly important and significant theme, that is, we are talking about the Disval, an amateur sports association that was born in 1998 - I make a very short history - for the will of the Valle d'Aosta Paraplegic association, which had the purpose of offering a first organizational structure to sport to the disabled in the Aosta Valley. We know the purposes, are to promote and spread the practice of all summer and winter sports and to organize precisely events and sports activities, also proposing an effective teaching activity for the start, updating and improvement of sports activities, in order to disseminate sport between the differently skilled. We know about the gym activity, we know about alpine skiing who, thanks to the collaboration with the ski masters, is developed in the Aosta Valley, training in schools (there is a nice awareness action also in this sense, that the disval is always carrying out). Among the most significant activities and also of external projection that carries out the Disval, the participation in the Italian Weelchair Curling Championship stands out which is held in several stages and which includes travel, even important, in different Italian locations. Furthermore, considering the significant results, four athletes of the Disvali have been summoned among athletes of national interest for several years; We have seen them in international events, even on television, so we are very happy with the activity they do, to underline the great and extraordinary activity that this association carries out in the Aosta Valley. It is an association that certainly needs the public, of the right attention of the public, and, as I say in the premises, we greet with great pleasure that the free concession for the structure of the Salle de Gymnastique has been changed in Piazza della Repubblica, in which we hope for the light as soon as possible the disval gym. However, to have those results I was talking about before internationally, it is necessary to be able to train and I would say that training are quite significant, especially for athletes who practice the Weelchair Curling, which train in Turin, right now. I wondered and asked them: ""But why do you always go to Turin in Corso Tazzoli?"". The problem is that the Courmayeur structure is not operational, it is not open, so it is necessary to go to Turin. This is a serious problem that is also strengthened by the fact that a few days ago, in a broadcast of Tg3, on the occasion of the presentation at the Palaghiaccio di Aosta of a national ice skating event, the manager, or one of the managers, of the Skating Club Courmayeur has highlighted and underlined that this lack of ice in Courmayeur makes 100 children no longer can do activities, ""We had to tell them to choose other sports"". In a European sport region, I would say that we have to do something more to go in the direction of trying to open this sports facility. I don't know if it's a cost problem. Therefore, we ask in the interpellation for what reason the ice stadium of the Courmayeur Sport Center is not granted and possibly what actions are intended to undertake to allow the athletes of the Disval, but also to the athletes of the Skating Club Courmayeur, to carry out the preparation and ice training of the Courmayeur structure. Probably, there is some activities in place, but we are pleased to know how things are going."
48037,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,4,5372,"Thanks also to the Baccega colleague for having wanted to highlight what is the important activity that the Disval carrier carries out on the Aosta Valley territory, for which the regional administration certainly has an eye. A part of the activities mentioned them, others are underway, also with reference to the Salle de Gymnastique. As regards the ice stadium, we obviously asked the municipality of Courmayeur which owns the structure, as the critical issues have been explicit for several years now, as, as she well knows, the track is closed before Covid. The main problem of closing the track is design, as the curling and skating rink share the same cooling system, but they need different ice temperatures to allow the different ice disciplines: therefore curling on one side and skating, hockey or short track on the other, which is impossible with the existing system. The solution, in fact, would be to separate the two plants and make them autonomous, as represented by a technician appointed directly by Disval and as confirmed also by the company in charge of the maintenance of the refrigerated systems of the structure. The separation costs of the plants, in order to make the curling totally autonomous, have been estimated at around 130 thousand euros plus VAT and design costs. In addition, the track turns out to be positioned under the steps, in an environment that cannot disperse humidity, thus creating big problems for the surface that must be perfect to ensure the sliding of the Stone. Without these interventions, the track is not such as to allow a good training, as it is represented, however, by the Valley Paralympic Committee to the Municipality of Courmayeur, precisely because of the Weelchair Curling that she has mentioned. To the above, the management costs are added (about 40 thousand euros per year), including electricity, heating, changing rooms, cleaning and other activities. The pressure problems on the main track have also been detected, which is why this has remained closed from September to today. The reopening of the curling track, without the interventions that I just listed them, would aggravate everything. For all the above reasons, the ice stadium has no longer been granted for the team's workouts. In recent months, however, there have been several interlocutions with the Municipality of Courmayeur, which declared itself available to take part in part of the costs necessary for the restoration of the curling track. The colleague Sapinet, with which we share the management of the interventions provided for by the regional law 16/2007, the one that supports the sports facilities of regional interest, has given availability to intervene with the planned share of the regional law itself, equal to 50% of the eligible expenditure, therefore in the next few months it will be given to the project activities and the subsequent financing of the works. The disval, with which you dealt with the topic on several occasions, has declared itself available to the management of the track also to put the structure in a position to be used to an extent higher than the use for the workouts of the Disvala, without however the accommodation of the management costs that I mentioned before and which amounted to about 40 thousand euros, which it would obviously not be able to support. The track has its own necessity, also because informal agreements have been taken with the National Coni to host the withdrawal of national teams of all Olympic disciplines that can obviously be hosted on our territory and a curling track in operation could give this opportunity to national teams participating in the Milan-Cortina 20-26 Olympics. As far as the second question is concerned, the specifics that the other structure that could accommodate curling training is the future Palaghiaccio of Aosta. In this regard, in this regard, the Municipality in question represented that the new plant provides, at the express request initially of the PNRR announcement and then upon confirmation of the Administration, the curling track for development in our city of this discipline, which sees precisely the disval between the protagonists in this particular sector, and in an interpellation, I believe of the colleague remain, a few months ago, we had listed the sports activities that would then be practicable inside the new Palaghiaccio, It has been spoken these days for the expression of interest that has ended positively with an offer, so the curling was also included. As regards the realization times, the Municipality is currently being awarded, so the intervention must end in 2026 in time for the start of the 2026-2027 sports season. It will obviously be indispensable, in the next spring, to complete the planning and punctual estimation operations of the costs, because today the costs that have been provided will certainly be susceptible to an increase, and to then be able to intervene with law 16 to give in the shortest possible time the possibility to disal to be able to train without having to use Turin or even, in some cases, Pinerolo."
48037,XVI,21/11/2024,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,6,598,"I would say that the responses he gave to our interpellation can only make us satisfied. Obviously, something was already moving, the hope is that you go in the right direction. If I understood well, 50% of the design phase (it can do me even a nod) of the curling track ... interruption off the microphone ... of the general costs, they are in the prerogative of law 16. This is certainly good news, if the Municipality of Courmayeur puts in the field of the resources it said, it means that we go in the direction of the start of an intervention.

A letter that the company has decided not to send me even for knowledge, but which I obviously received from my group leader, a letter with an evident intimidating character, as the lawyers I have also noted, and which is part of a wider action that was also explicit in the conference that CVA held on November 28 in the IV Commission in this classroom, two days after sending that letter, for an audition desired by the In order to give Cva, in essence, to try to close the mouth of the two regional councilors of PCP. An unprecedented thing given the ways in which the commission of 28 November took place, which was certainly not a simple hearing, but a sort of pre -pre -established and pre -packaged attack between Châtillon and Aosta, perhaps passing, who knows it, also for Rome. Compared to the response of the Prime Minister sent on 6 December, I must say that the content is absolutely acceptable because it rejects the absurd accusations and the peremptory requests of the top of CVAs regarding the management of the access to the documents of the councilors who are regulated by legal provisions, as well as by the internal regulation, and I refer in particular to law 20/2016, which also applies to CVA as a company participated and controlled by the Region. On the third question addressed, that is to say the request to the President of the Council to investigate the origin of reports received, a request that was then formulated in the Commission also by his colleague Perron, I note that many reports come to the councilors and it is certainly not a task of the presidency to carry out investigations and take measures in this sense on this issue; Specifically, among other things, however, I want to remember that reference was made to a public report of the board of directors of a public company, which is precisely our most important participatory. Certainly our inspection activity will also continue through access to the documents concerning CVA if this will be necessary. On the question, briefly, of the answer to our request for clarifications regarding the 2007 law, and in particular to the issue of mandates, we received, as the president said, on December 2nd this ""non -response"". It makes a little species that there has been 45 long days to decide that there is no title to respond, because it would be precisely mere hypothesis, and that it will take care of it when the case will be, if it will be the case. Now, we have never referred to the Bureau, much less to assessments of the Bureau, but we asked for a simple note of analysis and interpretation, not of evaluation, of the rule in question. A request that certainly does not be equivalent to the formation of a judgment, but that wanted to deepen the question from a legal point of view. However, I still miss a piece because we in the response letter that we sent them on 2 December asked for a copy of the act you mentioned with which the Bureau unanimously rejected the request presented and which we are therefore still waiting to see."
48050,XVI,09/12/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Malacrinò,Antonino,1977.0,M,FP-PD,2,18782,"Good afternoon to all. The documents that we are going to discuss during this week's works refer to the Regional Law 168 drawing as an object: ""Provisions for the formation of the annual and multi -year budget of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta"" and the bill 169 having as the object: ""Financial forecast budget of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta for the three -year period 2025/2027"", both presented by the Regional Council on 31 October 2024. examined during the works of the Regional Council, they were the subject of deepening during the hearing carried out in the II Commission of the permanent council commission. The path on the budget started on November 12 with the appointment of the two speakers: the councilor aggravated for the minority and undersigned for the majority, subsequently the session continued with the illustration of the two documents by the President of the Region and the programming of the following sessions. The works continued on November 25 with the hearing of the regional government and on the dates of 26 November and 2 December we had the opportunity to audire all the main bearers. The route ended on December 3 with the replica of President Testalin and the relative expression of the opinion. We now come to the analysis of financial documents starting from the bill 169. The 2025/2027 budget is drawn up in compliance with the principles contained in the legislative decree 23 June 2011, n. 118, containing: ""Provisions regarding harmonization of the accounting systems and budget schemes of the regions, local authorities and their bodies"". Financial programming for the next three years is consistent with the content of the regional economy and finance document, provided for by article 36 of Legislative Decree 118/2011, approved by resolution of the Regional Council on 18 October 2024. The regional budget equalized in the total amount in Euro 1,897,370,143.83 for the year 2025, in Euro 1.707.191.286.89 for the year 2026 Euro 1,608,062,854.01 for the year 2027. At the same time as the budget, continuing to the perspective of making the link between the various programming documents more and stronger and the use of the resources allocated in Title 2 of the expenditure, the regional program of public works and architecture and engineering services for the three -year period 2025/2027 and the related annual list are also approved. For the purpose of a correct assessment of the budget document, it is important to remember, especially in reference to the investments, which they are accounted for in a multi -year way on the basis of the time schedule of progress of the activities in correspondence with the effectiveness of the funded interventions. It should also be noted that the entry forecasts include the deferred active residues and re -recepted in the three -year period in question and the multi -year fund bound as well as the expense allocations include passive residues and the multi -year fund bound. The total of the revenues of competence scheduled for 2025, without considering the rounds of the round, is equal to 1,626 million euros, higher than the provision formulated for 2024, which was equal to 1,541 million. The forecast for the following two years of the many years of balance highlights a decreasing trend due to the normal trend of the provision of state funds and funds deriving from the European programming, to which is added the decreasing trend of the forecasting forecast. The total total of the revenue for 2025 is equal to 1,897 million compared to 1,819 million euros scheduled for 2024. The total budget includes the amount of the tied multi -year fund, which represents already available and accounted resources, deferred to subsequent years to meet the specific expenses, mostly of investment. The amount of the fund for 2025, equal to 150 million, was reduced compared to the previous year of 11 million and also expected to decrease during the three -year period. The early use of the binding administration surplus, which amounts to around 20 million euros, can only be enrolled in the first year of the forecast and derives from the summary of the bound resources already ascertained in the current year, or in previous years of which the structures have requested the early expenditure enrollment with the forecast budget. The revenues of Title 1, equal to 1,318 million for 2025, are approximately 71 million higher than the forecast for 2024; They consist of about 140 million taxes and approximately 1,178 million sharing to tax taxes. Title 1 revenues represent 81% of the total final revenue. As regards the revenues deriving from its own taxes, it is necessary to detect a decline of approximately 10 million euros, it is a prudential decrease inserted in the budget allocation to deal with the end of the regional Irpef regional for the first bracket, which will be the subject of a state regulatory intervention. As regards the type of sharing to tax taxes, there is an important increase due to the growth of the Irpef revenue, deriving from the payments made by the territory, and from a growth of VAT revenue deriving from inflation. The entrances to Title 2 from current transfers are expected in approximately 44 million for 2025 and are reduced in the three -year period up to approximately 23 million in 2027. These revenues represent just under 3% of the total of the final revenues. They are, mainly, state funds also deriving from the implementation of the national recovery and resilience plan, as well as funds relating to European programming, consisting of a Euro -citizen share and a state of state co -financing. The most significant amount of the forecast for the entire three -year period belongs to the ""current transfers from public administrations"" and affects over 70% on the total of title 2. In 2025, in particular, on a total provision of almost 34 million are about 8 million funds relating to the national recovery and resilience plan, 13 million state assignments, about 7.5 million European structural funds and 3.2 million as a complacency transfer of the maneuvering of the maneuver. IRAP arranged with the budget law 234/2021. Instead, it is recalled that the compensatory state transfer of the minors Irpef revenues, always arranged with the aforementioned Budget Law for 2022, completed the year 2024, determining on 2025 a level of forecast of the total total of the title decidedly lower than the allocation scheduled for 2024 2025 in the 2024-2026 budget, 135 million for 2026 and 98 million for 2027. These revenue represent about 10% of the total final revenues. The capital entrances of Title 4 are expected in approximately 83 million for 2025, 30 million for 2026 and 13 million for 2027. These revenues represent about 5% of the total of final revenues. The most significant amount relates to the type ""Investment contributions"" which includes: state contributions to investments aimed at economic development and protection of the territory intended for the Region for an amount of 20 million euros awarded again for the year 2025; contributions relating to PNRR and PNC for Euro 32 million in 2025 and 9.6 million in 2026; The contributions relating to European programming for about 20.2 million in 2025, 11.9 million in 2026 and 7.6 million in 2027. As is known, further resources will be registered in the budget during the year also for the following years with administrative acts of variation to the budget itself on the basis of the formal documents for the assignment of the same issued by the competent national and European authorities. The revenues referred to in Title 5 refer to the methods of accounting for resources deriving from the programming of European funds. The amount was provided for in Euro 15 million for the 2025 and 2026 and 16 million years for 2027. No use for debt is foreseen for the three -year budget. The total expenses for 2025 net of the rounds of the rounds is equal to 1,795,990,259.83 euros and includes, in addition to the provision formulated with reference to the costs of competence of the year, also the allocations already engaged in the availability of the previous years reputed to the 2025 exercise and the re -propositions of expenses bound to unused revenues in previous years. The contribution to public finance is also included in the current part of the current part. The total expenses, net of the rounds of the resources already committed, of the tied multi -year fund and the contribution to public finance, is equal to just over 900 thousand euros for the year 2025, at € 1.3 billion for the year 2026 and 1.3 billion for the year 2027 Mission 13 ""Health Protection"" Mission, which is intended for 23.27% of the resources and the 4 ""Education and right to study"" for 13.4%. Overall, the incidence of current expenditure compared to the investment expenditure is in improvement compared to the previous year. As regards the bill 168, the Stability Law is the law that in all respects adapts the regional system regarding the financial sector in order to prepare the subsequent authorizations implemented in the regional budget. The budget forecasts are in fact carried out under current legislation, to which are added the modification hypotheses inserted in law. The mandatory content of this law is actually attributable to matters that correspond to the references and consists of 59 articles for a total of 11 garments. The articles contained within this provision are all of particular importance and will be deepened during the works this week; As mentioned, it is a budget that puts large resources in the field to support our community. It therefore becomes difficult to summarize the content of the different articles in this relationship without neglecting some aspects of course of equal importance. Chapter I, containing provisions on staff, consists of 8 articles aimed at declining some issues including the needs of staff, the hiring derogations, the extension of rankings, mobility and contract renewals. Chapter II, containing provisions on local finance, is made up of 14 articles with which major resources are transferred to the local authorities aimed at maintaining services and covering the important increase in expenses. In this garment there are several articles, including article 7 that establishes the resources intended for local finance with a transfer that grows from approximately 239 million last year to 262 million; The transfer without bond to the local authorities instead amounts to 104 million. Within the same article there is also the extraordinary transfer, already provided, to the Municipality of Aosta for 1.5 million for the years 2025 and 2026 which with the following article 10 is also extended to 2027. In article 8 there is an extraordinary current transfer for 5.3 million in favor of the Municipalities, Units and BIM in partial coverage of the increase in contractual expenses. In article 9 there is also the extension for 2027 of the extraordinary current transfer of 12.5 million to the Municipalities and Unités already provided for by the previous budget for the 2025 and 2026 years. With Article 12, a financing of 200 thousand euros is expected to allow the completion of the structure called ""Maison Caravex"" in the municipality of Gignod. Article 13 provides for a contribution of 500 thousand euros for expansion and enhancement of exchange parking for the development of sustainable mobility. With Article 14, 1 million euros are transferred to local authorities to finance technical expenses and works to adjust the school buildings. Article 15 also extended to 2027 the allocation of 6.3 million in favor of municipalities for public utility works. With article 18 140 thousand euros are allocated for each year in order to keep the system actively aimed at promoting and facilitating the integration of foreign citizens. Article 19 grants a contribution of 83 thousand euros aimed at supporting the activities of the anti -violence center. Article 20, on the other hand, provides for the allocation of 140 thousand euros per year aimed at promoting the participation of minors with disabilities in the summer recreational services. Chapter III, containing provisions on health and social policies, consists of six articles that mainly bear provisions regarding the financing of regional health expenditure and relating to the essential levels of assistance. In this garment to report article 21 that room 9.3 million euros for the extension of the measure that finances the temporary health allowance in favor of doctors and nurses. Article 24 finances current health expenditure with approximately 340 million for each year, with an increase of approximately 13 million compared to the provisions of the Triennale last year on the annuality 2025. With article 25 the funds are doubled for preventive measures and combat suicide. Article 26 provides for the Volunteer Service Center an extraordinary contribution for 60 thousand euros necessary so that the Volunteer Services Center can continue to support territorial solidarity realities. Chapter IV, containing provisions on education and culture, is made up of 5 articles and in this case article 27 must be reported which allocates the sum of 3 and a half million in the three -year period for university construction interventions and for the completion of the intervention in the seat of the University of Valle d'Aosta, located in Viale dei Cappuccini. With Article 28, the extraordinary maintenance intervention of the former Priory and Saint-Bénin center is financed with around 15 million euros, owned by the ancient Collège Aux Études of Saint-Bénin. Chapter V, containing the interventions regarding the protection of the territory and the environment, consists of four articles. With Article 33, an expense of 70 thousand euros is authorized, compared to 2024 for management, restoration and maintenance of the sites belonging to the ""Natura 2000"" network and the sites identified by the regional ecological network. Article 34 provides for an allocation of 150 thousand euros in favor of the Safe Mountain Foundation for the organization of initiatives and events dedicated to the importance of the glaciers connected ""to the international year for the conservation of glaciers"". Article 35 provides for the realization of an extraordinary program of interventions for the reduction of hydrogeological risks and regional roads following the flood of the end of June, which provides, at the end of the necessary process, a refund by the state of about 20 million. Chapter VI, containing provisions on public transport, consists of 5 items; With article 36, tariff concessions are re -proposed and implemented to encourage the use of public transport. Article 37 provides for a contribution of 500 thousand euros to dismantle the old rope systems, abandoned for some time, and the subsequent environmental restoration. With Article 39 the measure of support for mobility in favor of Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers is extended. Article 40 extends until 2027 the plan of interventions for public utility works, it is a rule that also pursues a social interest. Chapter VII, containing provisions on sport and tourism, consists of an article, article 41, which also provides for the extension for 2027 of the ""Ski ... flying at school"" project, with an allocation that is still increased and which is brought to 50 thousand euros.

In this case, article 44 with which 3.5 million euros are allocated in the three -year period in addition to the Fosmit for the implementation of common strategies for the enhancement of the mountain areas are allocated. Article 49, on the other hand, provides for an integration of 14 million for the two-year period 2026-2027 on the rotation funds to give continuity to requests for facilitating the purchase of a first home or for the recovery of buildings in our historic centers. Chapter IX, containing the interventions regarding agriculture, consists of four articles, in this case it is necessary to report article 51 which provides for a co -financing of 3.5 million in the three -year period for the completion of the rural development program.

Chapter XI, containing provisions on accounting and finals, consists of two articles. The II permanent council commission, meeting on 3 December 2024, examined the bill 168: ""Provisions for the formation of the annual and multi-year budget of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta"" and the bill 169: ""Financial forecast of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta for the three-year period 2025-2027"" and expressed a favorable opinion of a majority. I thank the offices for the work done, the managers who intervened, the colleagues for the collaboration and all the bearers who participated in the numerous auditions."
48050,XVI,09/12/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985.0,M,RV,4,16363,"Before moving on to the report, I think it is a duty to thank the colleagues of the minority forces for the trust that still this year have shown me and also thank the offices they provided in the Commission, as well as the members of the government and also those who have been audited, the additional information that were requested a bit from all the groups during the auditions and then of the final replication of the President. I also want to thank in particular the colleagues of II Commission for the work done, which has already been the subject of attention by the majority speaker, as well as president of the same commission. Sometimes, in order to better understand the today and look to the future, it is good to turn back and remember what had been said about what then manifested itself in the recent past. A year ago I concluded my report to the bill to the forecast budget of the Autonomous Region for the three-year period 2024-2026 saying in extreme synthesis: ""The next three-year period will lead us to live in the season of increasingly short and increasingly dependent on third sources"". What can be analyzed today in the documents in question, only confirms this trend to which we are now increasingly condemned. A forecasting trend of the revenue (therefore consequently of public spending), which brings the ""housekeeper"" on duty (beyond its more or less declared sympathy for schools of economic policy) to limit its programming vision to the next 12 months in concrete terms, rather than to be able to plan with greater certainty the next 36 of the three -year period of reference. This aspect clearly emerges by analyzing the forecasting trend of the final revenues, for example, in the last three three -year three -year -olds. As can be seen in particular for the 2025 years, the entry forecasts gradually correct year after year, influenced by the ""underlying"" movements of public accounting. Among these, the investigations and estimates relating to taxes and taxes stand out, which are also affected by the measures adopted by the central government both during the year and with budget maneuvers. However, these interventions do not always correspond to a compensatory transfer for minors revenue, although in recent years the financial relations with Rome have demonstrated (for all regions) greater generosity than in the past. Another significant element is represented by the movements of the tied multi -year fund, which includes resources already accounted for, but deferred to the following years to finance specific expenses, in particular investments. It is important to note that this fund is foreseen in significant decrease during the three -year programming. The uncertainty that increasingly characterizes the programmer process emerges above all in the trend of current transfers, consisting mainly of state funds, resources of the national recovery and resilience plan and contributions to European programming, which include a community component and one of state co -financing. These resources are often integrated into the financial statements in the year following the documents of assignment of national and European authorities. This mechanism recalls, at least in part, the now famous and also infamous system of the ""Milestone"" of the PNRR, where respect for the established objectives determines the assignment of the shares (and perhaps this was precisely born from the experience of community programming). It is a now consolidated model, a sort of ""gentle leadership"" that represents a significant part of the budget. This theme deserves attention, especially in the three -year programming, to better allocate the regional resources, which by their nature remain limited. In this regard, I wish to highlight a point already raised during the auditions and which I consider important to reiterate (without any controversy). It would be useful, at least as long as the PNRR is operational, to precisely identify the resources that, for various reasons, require a reprogramming (or EU projects which then do not materialize on the side of the expense). This is not to satisfy a simple curiosity, but to verify if they exist margins of maneuver to allocate these resources to works or projects of particular relevance currently without financial coverage. Similar considerations must be made for capital revenues, which include contributions always linked to the PNRR, the complementary national plan and other European programming funds. Also in this case the resources are enrolled in the budget based on the measures adopted by the competent authorities. In this context, the programming activity moves in fact during the year with the definition of changes to the budget and, even more relevantly, at the time of the destination of the so -called ""available surplus"". This theme has been addressed several times on the occasion of the analysis of the annual reports and related budget settlements. It is as if the regional government policy was looking forward to the closure of the annual accounts to be able to divide the available surplus and plan the future of numerous projects, both of the historical and more recent age. This approach, however, appears in contrast with what could be (and should) do during the processing of the forecast budget, which represents the ideal time for a more strategic and organic programming. It would be at least questionable to compare the allocations of the different missions in relation to the individual programming years, as well as to compare the 2027 years with the next one of 2025. This is because in the three -year period of reference the total amount of expenditure (as well as revenue) contracts by about 18%. A similar fact was also recorded in previous three-year-olds: a 15% reduction in the period 2024-2026 and 13% in the three-year period 2023-2025. Although it is interesting to observe the expansion of the gap in the availability of spending in the various scenarios, this would require a more in -depth analysis to understand if there is a common cause or at least a trend. It may be useful to return to this point on the occasion of the analysis of the results of the next report. However, there are six missions that deserve particular attention for their trend in the three-year period 2025-2027. Of these two record an increase: mission 8 (territory structure and housing building) with +0.59% and mission 20 (funds and provisions) with a +0.68%. On the contrary, four missions show a negative trend (in fact more significant than the others, the values ​​that go beyond -1%) were considered: mission 15 (work policies for work and professional training) with -1.01%, mission 9 (sustainable development and protection of the territory and the environment) with -2.64%, mission 10 (transport) with a -2.77%and mission 13 (health protection) -6.53%. With regard to the latter, during auditions, it emerged that these decreases are widely influenced by the trend of certain expenses (and related allocations) envisaged in the three -year period. For example, in the case of mission 10, that of transport, the allocations for the purchase of trains are reduced precisely because of operations already carried out, while in mission 13 (protection of health), the allocation for the works relating to the Umberto Parini hospital is reduced as a result of the expenditure forecasts compared to the timing proposed for the completion of these. We also say that it is the largest mission and therefore obviously the one in which deviations are more significant in percentage numbers, but not overall. As regards mission 15 (labor policies), it should be noted that this is a expenditure item frequently subject to subsequent increases, above all as a result of the concretty of the assignment of Community funds, or also as a result of allocations of funds of state origin under the year. As regards the decrease in expenditure in Mission 9, it should be considered that the interventions expected in the two-year period 2025-2026 are related to projects such as the construction of a treatment and recovery system of mud from waste water, financed with PNRR funds for about 8.1 million euros. Other interventions, for example, concern the construction of purification plants and related sewage collectors for about 8.4 million euros, also concentrated in the first two -year programming. On the other hand, paragraph 1 of Article 28 of Law 30 states it: ""Among the allocations of the budget and the relative management budget, one or more global funds intended to meet the charges deriving from the proposals and the regional bills that enter into force after the presentation of the Regional Council of the Budget, to the extent deemed to be registered, to the extent deemed necessary for the application of the same"". Also in the field of folds of this budget there are elements that belong to the future political-administrative programming included in Mission 20. Among these we find ""mandatory"" interventions, such as, for example, the Fund for the renewal of the employment contract of the regional staff, that for the staff employed in the work of hydraulic-forestral and hydraulic-graduation accommodation and the allocation for the special fund destined for the new legislative provision- It is repeated over the years - for the equation of the legal status, the economic and social security treatment of the staff of the Aosta Valley body of the Fire Brigade and the Forestry Corps. These interventions are now a consolidated presence in different financial statements in recent years. However, mission 20 is not limited to these expenditure items already ... how to say? established or known, there are also funds intended for future legislative measures such as support for investments for innovation and sustainability of tourism-receptive and commercial activities. It is interesting to note that for the three -year period there are about 8 million euros for this purpose, apart from investments, a figure that, although it seems discreet, deserves to be deepened to better understand its effectiveness and the relative proposed destination. Obviously without the contents of the law, little can be said. Other interventions concern the revision of regional law 3, which governs interventions in favor of sport, as well as for support for mountaineering and hiking development. There is no shortage of allocations for other initiatives: the regional law against gender -based violence is not the first time, if I am not mistaken, that there is this fund, or for international recall events, such as the financing for the ""Women's World Cup"" of La Thuile. There are also funds for the creation of a new law on the third sector and for changes to Law 8/1992. Other allocations are intended for local events, such as the organization of the ""young criteria"" or the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the UVGAM. A final particular aspect concerns the fact that in mission 20 we also find the funds for the activities related to the issue of the bill for the re -attribution of the great concessions of water derivation, whose implementation rules scheme is to date at the examination of the I Commission. Before turning to the conclusions of this report, it is good to specify that during the general discussion there will certainly be further observations, analysis and comments on the contents of the bills in question by minorities. In this sense, as a minority rapporteur, I reserve the right from now on I can then add further considerations of a more political and part of the contents analyzed so far. The bill 173 entitled: ""Urgent provisions for the development and organizational flexibility of the bodies of the single sector of the Aosta Valley"", President Bertin has also announced it in the editorial office. These are the long -awaited changes to the regional law 22/2010, which governs the organization of the regional public sector, a reform expected for years, repeatedly evoked in previous minority relations and now finally under discussion. At the moment we cannot express evaluations on the content of the provision, which remains for us still unknown; However, I wish to open these conclusions by reflecting on this theme. The reform of the public sector does not concern only ""people"" and ""roles"", it affects a crucial aspect of regional expenditure, both in terms of current costs for maintaining the system, and in relation to the overall efficiency of financial management. Bureaucracy has a cost that can translate into efficiency or, on the contrary, in inefficiency. During the auditions (as already mentioned by commenting on Law 20), it emerged clearly how much the contractual renewals weigh on the regional budget. In fact, it was underlined that, on the three -year period 2022/2024, the total cost of renewals will translate into an increase of 15.01% of the expenditure. To this is added the greatest burden due to the increase in organic equipment, an element that absorbs an increasingly consistent share of the regional budget. However, there is the fear, which has already been manifested several times, that this reform has been conceived more as a ""positioning"" intervention than as an organic revision of the system. The next few months will clarify if this suspicion is founded. In the meantime, another crucial reform for the public system of the Valle d'Aosta still remains in the ""world of ideas"": that of local authorities. We had a whole year to discuss it, evaluate it and perhaps adopt courageous choices, instead the consolidated attitude of appeal prevailed, so perhaps something will change, but without really intervening in depth. Today we have a first draft to work on, but the time tightens and with it also the necessary courage seems to decrease. This theme is also strictly intertwined with the budget logic and with future programming, but everything, at least for now, has postponed. Another element that deserves attention is the approach to investment planning. Let's take as an example the intervention of the school building in via Torino, (the former Maria Adelaide), which should be transformed into a community center with a total investment estimated at 37 million euros. During the auditions I asked if the allocations expected in budgets were already linked to this project. The answer was affirmative: 600 thousand euros for the first two years intended for the design and 3.7 million for the start of the works and the demolition of the existing building. The rest of the allocations, however, is not yet defined, following a decision -making model that looks at the short term and which evidently reflects the absence of long -term programming. We wait for the surplus. This does not want to be a trivial criticism, but an invitation to reflect on the urgency of innovating the financing tools of public works, I quote only one: the ""PPP"". The ""short"" budget season and the impending weight of current expenditure, accentuated by external factors and by contractual renewals postponed too long they require us to rethink a too static and anchored budget structure to historical logic. It remains to be seen if the reform of regional law 22 will also face this question, but it is clear that it is a crucial theme to be considered beyond political disputes. We must be aware of the fact that the resources and opportunities of the past no longer exist. However, precisely for this reason it is essential to change approach and tools, facing the critical issues of the present with courage and responsibility. If we continue to think with outdated logic, we will risk finding ourselves faced with out of control problems, without the possibility of mitigation, even of solution and therefore we will remain anchored to the management of the current, to the short vision of the next 12 months."
48050,XVI,09/12/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,6,53269,"On 18 October we analyzed in a punctual and in -depth way, and then approved it, the document of economics and regional finance (Defr) which outlines the strategic objectives and defines the priorities of the administrative action, quantifying the deriving financial charges. Now with the budget 2025-2027 that we present to this classroom, we continue to give the contents to the programmatic lines, punctually to allocate the necessary financial resources, creating a sort of joint puzzles that we have tried to make as intelligible as possible in its complexity. What we lead to the attention of this Council is a balance of the end of the legislature, in fact, less than 10 months from the end of the sixteenth council and the renewal of the assembly separate us. In his editorial staff, therefore, he took into account this aspect, not wanting, on the one hand, strictly binding the next administration but, on the other, trying to continue in the wake of tracked giving an imprint of continuity in the years to come, especially as regards what during this legislature has been set according to the provisions of the program presented at the beginning of the council and then repairate at the time of the settlement of the current council. During these years there have been numerous initiatives that have materialized, transforming the ideas into measures, while, as regards others, the necessary conditions have been outlined and others have been sketched for their subsequent development. All this by always operating with a view to a strengthening of our autonomy and our prerogatives, of the uniqueness of the ""Valle d'Aosta system"" of which we must be proud, with particular attention to dialogue with the other territorial, national and even international realities, to collaborate with other entities and to confront each other, in some cases re -establishing the bonds that had been weakened, renewing feelings of friendship and collaboration. These aspects also transpire by examining this accounting document, where the numbers are traced, as well as to programs, missions and chapters, to transverse and qualifying actions and initiatives for the entire community. This following a fil rouge, a common thread characterized by sustainable growth, safety, accessibility and garrison of the territory, but also attractiveness, professional opportunities, development and enhancement of available resources, work and dignity, without forgetting the weak bands, disabled people, voluntary associations, those who in the most disparate sectors offer their time free of charge, sometimes neglecting their family and their interests to give help, comfort, It is found in a situation of discomfort or need. And this spirit of community and altruism was given full proof of this during the recent flood and in the immediate response and in the coordinated action between local administration and realities, operators of the various sectors concerned and population, associations, volunteers, businesses and individual citizens. The balance is the time to recognize the work done by going to allocate the related resources for those works that are almost due, heard by the community as necessary, important and enriching their safety or qualifying the services and opportunities for our territory and for our people. Choices that want to underline the importance of the garrison of the territory even at high altitude and the safe accessibility of the same and in a particular way in the historical moment in which we are experiencing, marked by climate changes that affect our territories and on our attitudes. A territory that, more and more, in this juncture characterized by demographic fragility, if it wants to be attractive, must be subject to continuous attention, so that the communities remain and continue to write their history. All this is found in the pages and among the numbers of this last legislature budget and in the punctual interventions of the Stability Law that accompanies it. I will proceed in the illustration of the forecast budget by highlighting some data that are considered relevant regarding revenue and expenses, and then dwelling with a examination on the different missions, highlighting the interventions of greater importance or particularly qualifying. Then we will pass to examine the stability bill, going to describe some actions contained therein in particular importance. The financial document equalizes in 1,897 million for the year 2025, in 1.707 million for the year 2026 and in about 1,608 million for 2027 626 million, 5.5% higher than the provision formulated for 2024, which was equal to 1,541 million. Over 80% of the final revenues consist of the tax revenues which were foreseen in 1,318 million for 2025, 71 million higher (5.7%) compared to the previous year. Of these entrances, the provision for its own regional taxes is equal to 140 million for 2025, falling 10 million compared to 2024 for the sole effect of a prudential provision with respect to the regional Irpef regional, this as there is an exemption ordered by the regional law for the first bracket, still for 2025, but the amount of the bracket could undergo changes due to possible state reforms in tax matters, possible need to adapt the provisions to date included in current legislation. On the other hand, the provision of the sharing to tax taxes, in the amount of the 9 tenths, is equal to 1,178 million compared to the 1,097 million scheduled for 2024 and therefore higher than 81 million than the previous year due to the trend envisaged for the main tributes shared. In fact, we are witnessing a significant growth in the Irpef revenue, which derives from both the payments made in the territory, also as a result of the recent maneuvers made by the State on the rates and brackets, and by the payments that flow to the budget of the region paid by the social security bodies on the amount of pensions provided to the Avaldostani; Overall, the revenue registered in the budget goes from 390 million scheduled for 2024 to 438 million scheduled for this next year. In addition, further growth in VAT revenue is expected, conditioned by inflation, albeit with growth with more contained rates than in the last two previous years; The incoming allocation is consequently passes from 417 million in 2024 to 440 million next year. I also point out a growth in the revenue of excise duties on autoration fuels, foreseen both in relation to the revenue reported to the last year available, communicated by the Customs Agency during 2024, and to the state maneuvers on these excise duties. The relative budget entry from 48 million scheduled for 2024 to 64 million for 2025. On the other hand, a reduction of the IRES revenue was provided, whose provision is 48 million against 62 million in 2024 Instead, there are no significant variations regarding the forecasts of the jets deriving from indirect taxes, mainly relating to real estate transactions, such as registration tax, mortgage tax, etc. A annotation for transparency and fairness is imposed: the growth of revenue is not exclusively referable to an inflationary phenomenon, which has certainly influenced the cost of living in recent years and to national tax maneuvers, but also to the upper consolidation of the real economy that finds full reflections in the positive data of the occupation in the Aosta Valley. Continuing in the exposure of the data relating to the revenue, it is highlighted how the revenues from current transfers represent just over 3% of the total of the final revenues and are expected in 44 million for 2025 compared to the 64 million provided for 2024 2025-2026. The transfer, of approximately 24 million per year, was in fact ordered by the state budget law for the year 2022 with reference to the 2022-2024 three-year, in relation to the aforementioned state maneuvers on the rates and on the IRPEF brackets carried out after the special autonomies had already approved the relative budget. As regards the enrolled allocations, these are above all state funds, also deriving from the implementation of the national recovery and resilience plan, as well as funds relating to European programming, consisting of a Eurocomune share and a state of state co -financing. In 2025, in particular, on an overall forecast of almost 34 million euros from ""public administrations"", 8 million euros were allocated in funds relating to the PNRR, 13 million state assignments bound to specific expenses, 7.5 million European structural funds and 3.2 million as a compensatory transfer provided for at a regime of the IRAP maneuver made by the State by budget law for 2022. The other important item of current transfers consists of the transfers of the European Union, equal to 6.7 million euros for the 2025 year. As is known, further resources will be enrolled in the budget as current transfers, during the year, also for the years following 2025, with administrative acts of variation to the budget itself, on the basis of the formal acts for the assignment of the same issues by the competent national and European authorities. The extra -tax revenues, on the other hand, represent about 10% of the total of the final revenues and are expected for 166 million for 2025 compared to 153 million in 2024. About a third of the provision of these revenues, i.e. 56.4 million, refers to revenue deriving from the management of the region's assets, in which the fees deriving from the management of the water property for an annual amount of approximately 37 million and the revenue provided for active health mobility, for an amount of 14 million per year. Let's now move on to capital revenues. These entries were scheduled for 83 million for 2025 compared to the 61 million scheduled for 2024 and represent about 5% of the total of the final revenues. These are contributions to investments that, in particular, include: - state contributions to investments aimed at economic development and the protection of the territory for an amount of 20 million euros assigned again for 2025; - contributions relating to PNRR and PNC for various investment interventions for 32 million euros in 2025 and 9.6 million in 2026. I remember in this regard that in that year the projects must be completed; - contributions relating to European programming for about 20.2 million in 2025, 11.9 million in 2026 and 7.6 million in 2027 This explains the normally decreasing trend of the forecasts in the three -year period of the budget. A quick but significant mention of the debt. During the three -year period in question there is no use of the new debt and moreover, new returns from special management at Finaosta are not foreseen to cover Poste of the three -year period as happened in the past budgets, thus freeing further interesting opportunities for resources in future perspective. I also remember in this regard, given its relevance, that in the annuality 2023-2024, the debt contract was refunded, through Finaosta S.p.A., with the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti for an amount of Euro 46.5 million in 2023 and of 43.7 million in 2024 for a total of over 90 million euros, thus reducing the costs of the same and freeing resources to be used even in the current part. The agreement recently signed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as is known, confirmed the contribution to public finance in € 82.246 million up to 2032, thus giving stability to the same and clarity of programming horizon. This contribution is also inclusive of what is due for local authorities which will therefore not be subject to new state impositions, without a prior agreement. At the end of the legislature we therefore deliver, and I would like to highlight it, a solid financial situation, with the accounts in order and a stable perspective for the purpose of adequate programming and possible growth in the strategic opportunities that await the region in the next three years. Moving on to examine the expenditure, the provision of current expenditure registered in Title I (current expenses) stands at 1,394 million euros, with an increase of 4.6% compared to 2024. The investment expenditure of Title II grows at 396 million euros in the year 2025, with an increase of 5.9% compared to the current year. The incidence of current expenditure compared to the investment expenditure is equal to 76.80%, albeit slight improvement compared to the previous year. It should be noted that the growth of current expenses is fundamentally linked, also for the year 2025, to the increase in contracts for salaries that grow, as regards regional staff from Euro 108 million to 118 million, to which are added the allocations for the contractual renewal of regional staff, in line with the previous three years, for about 27 million in 2025, 30 million in 2026 and 33.5 million in 2027. This path will be able to bring new palatability to the regional sector and local authorities, with major, new and young professionals who will be able to approach, as are growing the amounts of contracts against the service company, which increase both by virtue of the effect of the increase in inflation, and for the increase in the activities carried out and requests. The amount of the allocation for the contract with the service company thus goes from € 21.3 million in 2024 to 25.6 million in 2025, with an important increase in resources intended for social and support for the person, primarily in the context of assistance and support, even educational, of students with disabilities. Also in the field of personnel expenditure, it is necessary to report how the rules for containment of the expenditure and the hiring limits are confirmed in line with the past. We will therefore replace those who leave the working world by banning competitions for places not covered already foreseen by the plan of staff needs for the three -year period 2024/2026, with reference to the year 2024, and from the plans of previous years, thus going to ""rejuvenate"" the sector at an indicatively more contained costs. With regard to the priorities, the preparation of the budget has been oriented to ensure and guarantee in continuity with previous years: economic development, work, protection of the territory and personal services, especially in the health, social and education. The overall distribution of expenditure for areas of competence evidence in particular Mission 13 (health protection) to which 23.27% of the resources are intended, mission 4 (education and study right), which reaches 13.04%, with an increase compared to 2024 which sees a percentage equal to 12.50% and mission 18 (reports with other territorial and local autonomies) which represents 12.37%. Together these three areas of action represent 48.68% of the overall allocations. As regards local finance specifically, the total loan grows from 239 million euros of 2024 to 262.4 million euros for 2025. Of these, transfers without bond to local authorities are equal to 104 million euros and are in line with the previous year, but above all they have also been confirmed for the year 2027, so as to give certainty of resources and programming of the expense. An expense that through local authorities wants to ensure attention to the community, a guarantee of services, sustainability of the activities carried out by the Municipalities, which remain the first interlocutors of citizens and who must be able to count on the certainty and balance of their budgets. The current transfer had in fact been increased for the municipalities of Euro 12 million in the years 2024/2025, for the Units des Communes of Euro 500 thousand for the years 2024 and 2025 by regional law 12/2023. This continuity wants to represent a particular sign of attention to these entities. Local finance transfers with destination constraint then grows from 135.6 million to 156 million euros. This growth is determined in particular by the additional transfer of Euro 5.3 million in favor of the Municipalities, the Units des Communes and the BIM to partial the increase in personnel expenses, from the allocation of 2.8 million for public utility projects, from 1 million euros for interventions of the school construction of local authorities, from 700 thousand euros for investments in the field of housing policies and 500 thousand euros for infrastructure for the intermodality of the Transport: all the resources that can be implemented during the year, but which immediately guarantee the presentation processes of the indispensable interventions during the programming. Having made these necessary premises, we believe it is relevant to deepen the various missions here, identifying the quantitatively relevant interventions or in any case characterizing the forecast budget that we pay to your attention. The amounts that will be illustrated below are summarized on page 8 of the budget bill report. Mission 1 ""Institutional, General and Management Services"" are intended for over 132 million euros in 2025, against 125 million of the previous year. Within this mission, the most relevant items of expenditure are constituted: - from the expenses for regional staff employed in the implementation of the interventions included in this mission for the total amount of approximately 49 million euros; - from the expenses for the management and development of information systems and above all of the administrative activity for about 19.2 million euros in 2025; - from current transfers for the functioning of the regional council, to which 8.5 million euros are intended for each year of the three -year period. À la Mission 4, here it concerns the éducation et le droit aux études sons près près de 236 millions of euros contre les 213 millions engagés pour le 2024.

Mission 6 welcomes the allocations relating to youth policies, sport and free time. The resources allocated are around 11.5 million euros in the first year of the budget. On this mission we find the appropriations in favor of the bodies and professions of tourism and the support of youth policies. Among these 565 thousand euros for transfers to institutions for federal sports activities and 950 thousand euros for the management of swimming pools. Regarding tourism, at Mission 7, the regional budget provides for a total of 22 million euros for the first year of the three-year period and, in addition to the significant resources intended for the initiatives for the promotion of the tourist image of the Region which in recent years have been particularly cared for, allocated 8 million euros in the three-year period for a new legislative provision to support the innovation and the sustainability of tourism-receptive activities and commercial activities. This area may thus be dedicated to resources and funds for the improvement of efficiency and the modernization of the structures with a view to enhancing them in an environmental context increasingly in line with the dictates of the energy transition and attention to the environment. In addition, current transfers to companies for extraordinary interventions in favor of neighborhood exercises for 1 million euros per year confirm the attention to the small proximity trade in the regional socio-economic context. 650 thousand euros per year are then intended for contributions to investments to businesses, individuals, social institutions and local administrations for interventions, furnishings and equipment related to shelters, bivouacs and Dorters who have proven to be very important resources for summer tourism in our region in recent years and deserve a renewed attention to keep them in step with the times and attractive for especially foreign customers. About 4 million per year are then intended for current transfers to the officer Régional du Tourisme, while the current transfers to support the Actor of the Valley Union of the High Mountain Guides are scheduled for € 260 thousand for 2025, to which will be added 50 thousand euros for the celebrations of the 50th anniversary. The allocation for current transfers in support of the activity of the Valle d'Aosta Ski Association is instead defined in € 322 thousand for each year of the three -year period: associations that fully represent the concept of living in the mountains, in a modern and young vision, and of being able to do it above all in compliance with the peculiarities of our history and our region. In addition, during 2025, it is important to highlight it, support will be assured of a series of important initiatives for the development of the offer and tourism promotion, such as the ""Women's Work Cup"" by La Thuile, the Youth Criterium, the passage of the ""Giro d'Italia"" and the Italian billiard championships for the years 2025-2026, for a total of 2.6 million euros. These events demonstrate the great trust that the different sports federations have placed in our region and in its vocation not only in the organization of competitions, but also in the welcome of the participants and their families. This - and I also want to remember it here in which there is normally a lot of numbers of numbers and little of other aspects that give the same numbers and value - thanks to the fundamental collaboration of local authorities, sports institutions and volunteers without which it would not be possible to achieve these events. This is also recognized outside our borders and deserves to be underlined in this location. Turning to the examination of Mission 8 concerning the structure of the territory and housing construction, for 2025 5 million euros have been allocated, which become over 8 million for the following year and 14 million in the last year of the three -year period, therefore constantly increasing. Three million overall are intended for interventions on public residential construction, while 4 million in 2026, which become 10 million in 2027, are set aside for the rotation fund in support of mortgages for the first house; This is to give continuity to the support for the family, the future and the stabilization of young people, but also to the recovery of the local building heritage and the enhancement of our villages, also with a view to repopulation of our historical nuclei and saving the use of soil. Sustainable development and the protection of the territory and the environment is the subject of mission 9. Over 103 million have been scheduled for 2025, over 70 in the following year and 60 for the third year of the three -year period. In the first year of the three -year period, about 30 million euros are intended for the defense of the soil, 14 million to the protection, enhancement and environmental recovery, 8 million on waste, over 11 million for the integrated water system, as well as important resources for protected areas, natural parks, naturalistic protection and forestry. Over 6 million are then intended for the sustainable development of the mountain territory and small municipalities and the same sum of the same is intended for air quality and reduction of pollution. Some rumors specifically: - 9.6 million for each year allow the hiring of staff in charge of forestry construction sites and 8.4 million overall on the three -year period, of which 4 million in 2025 are allocated by way of contributions for the purchase of low -emission vehicles, of pedal -assisted pedal vehicles, for micro mobility and for the installation of household charging stations for electric vehicles. Over 6 and a half million euros are then scheduled for current ARPA transfers, over 1.3 million for each year of the three -year period are intended for the manager of the Mont Avic Natural Park for operating expenses; 16.8 million euros are budgets in the three-year period for the extraordinary maintenance of third party goods, hydraulic-forest accommodation aimed at the protection of the territory by landslides, floods and avalanches and for the regulation of the torrent rods. The control, protection and management of the territory are in fact one of the topics most attentive to this budget, in line with the legislature program. We have underlined it several times as a monitored territory, as safe and accessible as possible, it is a territory that can be lived, to be inhabited, to be chosen also by the new generations, in short, more attractive. All this therefore deserves an additional effort. Attractivity is in fact a transversal theme in the policies of this regional government and in the folds of the budget we find many measures that directly or indirectly relate and enrich attention to this issue. This is accompanied by an increasingly punctual attention and supported by important resources that accompanies the energy transition and also puts our attention to the environment, its protection and its enhancement. Mission 10 refers to transport and the right to mobility. To this end, over 143 million were allocated in 2025, of these: - about 22 million intended for public transport contracts with bus and supplementary services of local importance and 2.8 million for the granting of tariff concessions; - about 22 million for local railway public transport contracts; - 3.2 million intended for public transport of disabled people; - 4.7 million for the remnants of the regional roads. For regional interventions in support of sports infrastructures in the cable car complexes of over -room apartment referred to in regional laws 8/2004 and 6/2018, the appropriations in the budget are more contained in the perspective of refinance them during the year with the following measures. The allocation of 1.8 million euros is also confirmed for 2025 for the granting of contributions in favor of small ski resorts of local interest. Regarding public transport, the facilitations for the use of public transport will be extended in the stability law and a project for the disposal of old rope systems will be started with the initial financing of 1.5 million euros. This will allow important environmental recoveries in those locations where until the eighty-noun of the last century the weather conditions had made it possible to think of small ski lifts that have now become anachronistic and on which therefore it will be intervened with an appropriate environmental recovery. There is also the purchase of new trains for the Piedmont-Valle d'Aosta connection for Euro 4.3 million. At Mission 11, which concerns civil rescue, 525 million are allocated in 2025, growing compared to last year, while between 43 and 44 million are expected in the following two years. This mission includes, among others, the expenses relating to civil protection, the voluntary body of the firefighters and the helicopter rescue and we have been able to see in these years how important this sector is in moments of emergency and calamity, but also in moments of ""quiet"", in everyday life, to guarantee the population and above all of the communities most difficult to reach or distant from the services. In the budget chapters we find the funds allocated for the emergency system of the Aosta Valley, which represents one of the best organizations at national level, also thanks to the collaboration between the bodies of the professionals and the essential resources made available by the volunteering that allow immediate proximity interventions and which constitute a flagship of our local communities. Specifically, 7.7 million for the helicopter rescue service are highlighted on the territory, more than 7.3 million for the management and enhancement and adaptation of the single rescue center and 4.2 million for the purchase of vehicles to be assigned to the firefighters. Over 2 million per year are intended for public service contracts relating to the organization and carrying out the rescue activities in the mountains and civil protection. Mission 12 instead concerns social rights, social policies and family. The resources allocated are 124 million in 2025, slightly growing compared to the current year, where there were 112 million. Coming to the amourse amounts, we find in the various mission programs: - 32.4 million per year intended for current transfers for social security interventions in favor of civil disabled; - about 21 million for each year transferred to local authorities for the management costs of social services in favor of elderly and unable and 7.5 million for the management of early childhood services; - 6.5 million annually intended for the stipulation of conventions with rest homes; - 11.6 million on 2025 intended for the program of interventions for the protection of the right to the home; - 3.9 million for each year for expenses for public service contracts intended for interventions and support of people with disabilities; - 3 million overall on the three -year period for vouchers intended for families for the family nanny service; - 2.7 million per year for the purchase of services by the Regional Service Company for the realization of assistance and support activities for families in the socio-assistance scope; - 2.1 million per year for expenses for the purchase of services connected to the insertion in structures for minors, young people and parent-children; -1.7 million transferred to non-self-sufficient subjects for conferences to socio-welfare, socio-health and rehabilitative structures; - 1.35 million to the functioning of the Jean-Boniface Festaz nursing home. Also these issues represent qualifying elements of the budget, with attention to those who need support: disabled, unable and those who need rehabilitation, the elderly, especially those that are not self -sufficient who need assistance and their families, minors who live moments of discomfort. Furthermore, here are the services for early childhood, essential initiatives to try to contrast the growing denatility that characterizes the historical moment that we are experiencing and hand in hand with social policies we have the protection of health, the subject of the subsequent mission 13. For 2025 there are 459 million, 398 million in 2026 and 354 in 2027. In particular, the health expenditure of the current part of the annual transfer to the Usl of the 333 million to 340 million, of which 12 million euros intended for the temporary health allowance and 5.6 million to the recognition of the economic improvements provided for the staff under the agreement with the regional health service. The amount of 336.4 million per year is instead intended for the ordinary current funding of the regional health service to guarantee the essential levels of assistance, while 2.5 million euros are annually intended for the current additional funding of higher assistance levels. The expenditure for investments in the health sector is also confirmed for the three-year period 2025-2027 in 6.5 million euros per year.
