48019,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963,M,RV,2,609,"Yes, quickly, the questions look at the situation regarding the problems of the Palafent de Brissogne area; we know that recently there was another offer for the management of the restaurant and bar, we ask if all the infrastructure works planned inside and outside the structure have been carried out and, again, to know if there are changes that are envisaged even by the Regional Administration for the future operation of the area and how we imagine involving in this subject, in this project the Fédérachon Esport de Nohtra Téra."
48019,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,80,"Ha chiesto la parola il Presidente della Regione per la risposta, ne ha facoltà."
48019,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Infrastrutture ricreativo-sportive",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,4,3873,"First of all, I would like to thank the Councillor for giving us the opportunity to take stock of the situation on the Palafent. There is currently no situation concerning the Palafent structure that prevents its full use from a sporting point of view, moreover, on Monday 18 November the deadline for submitting bids to participate in the public auction, launched by the Fédérachon, for the management of the bar-restaurant closed, as we know, following the dispute with the managing president, expired. As for the work requested by the Fédérachon Esport de Nohtra Téra, I inform you that the following work has been carried out: energy efficiency for the entire structure for a total amount of 350,000 euros; intervention of the water meter users division; the replacement of the drain pump of the wastewater collection tanks and the remote control of its operation, on this point the Public Works Department reports that the problem concerned exclusively the caretaker's accommodation and not the toilet drains of the establishment; the overall intervention to fit out these drains, which is not essential to the use of the infrastructure, will however be scheduled soon after the analysis of the possible intervention alternatives. In addition, the real estate and sports infrastructure structure of the Public Works Department, following the identification of the new manager, will carry out a joint inspection with the Fédérachon to check the functionality of the electrical heating systems, the catering and caretaker's accommodation areas and, possibly, carry out the necessary development and restoration interventions taking into account the priority of our uses, which has lasted more than a year. Finally, the Department of Natural Resources recently entrusted our services for the adaptation of the automated irrigation system of the green space, to optimize the creation of a lawn for their sports activities, for a total of approximately 50,000 euros, work that will be completed we hope very, very soon, between the end of the year, by the end of the year. As for the third point, we therefore confirm the attention of the Regional Government to popular sports, both with regard to the Fédérachon and the sports associations that compose it, as well as with regard to the structure in question; proof of this is that during the year 2024, at the request of Fédérachon, the budgetary allocation of 95,000 euros for traditional sports was increased to 150,000 euros, the additional sum of 55,000 euros was granted as an expense account necessary for the realization of the vast activity carried out for the promotion of traditional sports in schools, given that the amount of the association had remained unchanged for several years, as well as for new activities. The FENT plans in particular to proceed, among other things, with a multilingual reprint of the brochure on traditional sports to be distributed in schools of all levels, as well as at the extra-regional level and for promotional purposes, to participate in international activities organized by the European federations, to create a short video presenting the traditional games of the Aosta Valley, highlighting their social, cultural and geographical context to be distributed on the social networks and websites of the Fédérachon, but also of the international associations of traditional sports, as well as to provide for the digitization of its documentary photographic archives. In this regard, I wanted to emphasize that a meeting is planned very soon with the President of the Fédérachon, with the competent Assessorates to establish a program of initiatives to achieve what still remains to be done."

Well, thank you for the answer, which is quite, quite complete and even elements in addition to what I had asked, so here we can only be satisfied with the answer, we hope that the new manager of the area is someone serious at least, because this structure surely needs good management and, if everything you have just told us is going to be achieved, well, we are surely going in the right direction and we wish the popular sports of the Aosta Valley great success."

47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,1,100,Let's skip item 67 and get to item 68 on the agenda. Councilor Lavy has the floor.
47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,2,5261,"We have already addressed this issue in the last Council because, in fact, it had been brought to the agenda by colleague Minelli on the DEFR, but perhaps a little more in-depth analysis is necessary, because, in fact, we learned from her hearing in the Commission and from the coordinator - and subsequently she also explained it during the discussion of the agenda - that the Monte Rosa and Cervino companies have moved in the assignment process of the so-called DOCFAP, the Feasibility Document of the Project Alternatives, based on Legislative Decree 36/2023. At the time, when she mentioned this legislative decree, apart from those who are technicians... for us it was absolutely not easy to do an immediate in-depth analysis, because in fact the DOCFAP is regulated in Annex 1.7 of the legislative decree, which is quite substantial. What is the point? The new procurement code has modified the design discipline, providing for two design levels and including, among other things, the Feasibility Document of Design Alternatives, which must be drawn up in compliance with the contents of the requirements framework and is a precursor to the drafting of the Design Direction Document, the so-called DIP. DIP which indicates, in relation to the size, specific typology and category of the intervention to be carried out, the characteristics, requirements and design documents necessary for the definition of each design level. With this DOCFAP, therefore, the first step has been established to begin the design of the work, without the Council having said anything about the study. The same companies in the hearing - I will not report the minutes, because I have not yet understood whether it can be done or not, theoretically not - had however established the fact that the study would then give us Councillors the tools to give the same companies the mandate to proceed with an executive and definitive design. Instead, with this document the study would already be overcome, without us having expressed ourselves, to evaluate the best alternative among those proposed and to begin the design of the work. But it does not seem to me that, precisely, these were the agreements. We are certainly not technicians, but at least to examine the issue in depth, especially the economic-financial one, I believe is absolutely essential, given that the companies have even asked for 100% regional financing. It is fine that they are participated, so the money, on one side or the other, is always public money in some way, however - since the financing requested is a special law that, as for the Skyway, finances 100% - rightly a whole series of considerations must be made. Councilor, you know very well that from our point of view we are absolutely not against the project, on the contrary, but we know that it is a project of truly great importance and therefore certainly all the necessary investigations must be done, as was in fact said. Surely then you will reply that in reality this step forward was traced by the previous DEFRs, precisely in relation to the technical-economic feasibility, but the Council, at least from this side, had a totally marginal role. We have already spoken about it: that there is the political will on the part of the majority to carry forward this project is beyond any doubt, no one questions it at all, on the contrary; however, precisely because it was established that it was the Council that had to contribute and participate in the analysis, in the study and then in any case also in the evaluation of the technical-economic feasibility of the work, I believe this process must be carried forward. I truly hope that there was some sort of misunderstanding between you and the President of the Commission, because in fact it seems that perhaps... but you rightly did not participate in the hearings, so you cannot know what was said and what was not, but perhaps you could have believed that after that hearing we could move forward without any kind of problem and that the analysis of the study was finished, which in reality is absolutely not true. This initiative is precisely to clarify and we want to at least reiterate whether there is the intention to have the Regional Council express its opinion on this study and on the alternatives proposed in it: assuming that we are not technicians, therefore we cannot say whether alternative 1 or alternative 3 is right, pbecause we certainly do not have the expertise, at least, I personally do, to say what is the best thing, but to delve into the matter, given that it is a very substantial study, absolutely yes. ""What is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the assignment of the DOCFAP, in this case ousting the Regional Council, when it was said that the study was preparatory to the DOCFAP"": if we have not given any kind of opinion on the study, I do not understand why we are already moving forward in this direction. Furthermore, ""Whose decision was it"" - whether it was yours, Councilor, or the companies' - ""To proceed with the next assignment of the Feasibility Document of the project alternatives without even communicating it to the Regional Council, if not when the process has already started""."
47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,65,"For the answer, the floor is given to Councilor Bertschy. He has the right to do so."
47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,UV,4,4884,"Thank you, colleague Lavy, also for how you have illustrated the initiative. The topic is probably a topic of great importance and it may also be that, with respect to the terminology at a technical level, there may sometimes be misunderstandings, or even incorrect communication on my part, as on the part of the coordinator, as happened during the hearing. I clarified this during the discussion of the last Council. I come to the answers and then I also try to make two political considerations. On the part of the majority, to come to the first question, ""Whether there is the intention to have the Regional Council express its opinion on the study and on the alternatives proposed in it"", I would not answer this question exactly. Whether there is the political will to continue to discuss it in the Commission and in the Council: yes. I believe that it is necessary, as the President of the Commission also said when speaking on the last occasion: to have a meeting, perhaps a smaller one, to understand what the opposition is asking for in order to do this in-depth work and what we can give, as a political role, to the bodies we have. She said it and I repeat it: on a technical level it would be wrong to replace one another, also because, beyond the competences, there is also a question of responsibility for the procedures envisaged. The majority has no intention of not working openly on this project, we have been doing so since 2020, from the first DEFR, and we have done so subsequently. The DEFR indicate the paths, but these absolutely do not preclude discussion. We need to understand, once and for all - but I am also available for a meeting with the Commissions or with the group leaders, with whoever you want - understand what is meant by expression of the Council, so we go into detail. Several colleagues have requested it, colleague Minelli requested it and colleague Aggravi requested it: let's decide what role we want to give in this phase and let's do it. Of course we didn't want to collaborate on projects of such wide scope and interest. We are very convinced that the operation can go ahead, we have said so; this is also supported by a whole series of expressions from the structures of the regional administration. The Lega group was already saying it then, as I had the opportunity to say during the last discussion in the chamber: even the Lega group, when we made this choice on the DEFR 2022, had considered it a step that was too restrained, so let's welcome the in-depth analysis. I repeat: let's see what is required, whether a further hearing in the Commission on that document, or something else. At point 2, ""What is the reason why the companies are proceeding with the assignment of the Feasibility Document of the project alternatives of the work, ousting the Regional Council, when their leaders have repeatedly stressed that it would be the Regional Council that would decide what should be done"". On this, the question was probably asked following the hearing. In the last Council I said that it is not a new document, the document is the initial one, the one of the assignment of the project, which the companies have considered, pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023, Article 41, Annex 1.7 - more than the companies, the professionals who analyzed the study for the company - that it could be a DOCFAP still to be completed, so there was no indication to move forward, rather than give that project the value of DOCFAP. To date it has not yet been approved and the companies, to approve it, obviously also ask the regional administration for clarity on the next steps and the activation of a specific program agreement. This is why in the DEFR of last year and this year we said that it is necessary to start the authorization process, so as to then be able to have the structures express themselves on the entire procedure if necessary. Question 3 is now outdated, in the sense that there has been no indication to move forward, but rather now it is also the companies that are asking the political part - the Council, the Executive, the majority - how to proceed, because a series of elements are missing, in particular, as was said last time, it would be necessary to proceed with the SEA and the VINCA. To move forward, in fact, a process must be regulated at an administrative level, which could be regulated through a program agreement. I repeat that there have perhaps been moments inwhich we have not been sufficiently clear, I say this also because there have been several discussions in this Chamber with my colleague Minelli. It is necessary to understand what role the Council should assume, if it is the Council, or the Commission, if it is the Commission, with respect to the documents we have in our hands today. We will certainly not be the ones to preclude a discussion on the subject."
47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,5,42,"For the reply, the floor is given to colleague Lavy."
47950,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Impianti a fune",en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,6,1858,"I am satisfied, I also appreciated the tone with which you said that there is maximum availability. It is true, the question mark was somehow understanding how to work, because it has always been said that the Council has a central role, but it has not been defined how and what it means that the Council has a central role. We should have a meeting between group leaders to decide the next steps to take forward. I think it is absolutely correct and something truthful that there is the will, I think on everyone's part, to discuss this issue. As for the answer to the second question, I understood that you, in fact, have nothing to do with it and I didn't have many doubts about this. In some way, the attitude of the companies leaves me with some question marks, because, perhaps not having had any kind of response from the political side, to understand how the analysis of this study would have progressed, perhaps a phone call to someone on the Council, perhaps not to you, but to the President of the Commission, to understand if the analysis of the study in the Commission would have progressed, perhaps it should have been done. Because, as I said before, the DOCFAP is a preliminary document for the design and it had been reiterated several times that the study was useful to us to then give directions for the design, to carry out these procedures, which was not done. We know very well that, when it comes to certain topics, some doubts arise. I am not talking about you, Councilor, I am talking at the company level, because several times we see certain attitudes that create many questions, to say the least. I therefore appreciate your spirit, I appreciate the fact that in any case it is also up to us, as Councilors, to see each other and decide what we want to summarize this centrality of the Council, so we will certainly update each other."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,1,85,"Item 70 on the agenda. For the presentation, the floor is given to colleague Perron."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Perron,Simone,1979,M,LEGA VDA,2,2423,"Thank you, Mr President, for the prompt passion with which you give me the floor. We always come to the topic of transport and buses. We are talking about the experimental on-demand public transport service for the connection with the international airport of Milan Malpensa. Highlighted that this line, which was in service from 5 July to 9 September 2024, was operational on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; recalled that - this is data from 2016, if I made a mistake in the request the Councillor will correct me, it is data that I found in the Sole 24 Ore - following the acquisition of 100% of Savda by the Arriva Italia group, public road traffic in the Aosta Valley is managed 50% by this company; considering that, looking on the site, the line is currently temporarily suspended and postponed to the next reactivation in December 2024; let's ask three very specific questions. The first: ""What were the results of this experiment during the summer months, whether there was satisfaction"", obviously they pointed out to us the fact that those who have to take the bus to go to Malpensa would have needed this bus even on more days, this is a bit of the rationale of the question, but you will give us information on this; ""What reasons determined the specific limit of days of operation during the period carried out""; ""What intentions does the regional administration have"", so perhaps information is given outside a little earlier than it will happen on the company website, to allow people to know which and when other buses of this type will be there; ""When will the service be reactivated and the possible limitation of operating days in the winter tourist period"". These are the questions. By the way, since we are talking about electric mobility - this is not addressed to anyone in particular, but I stick to the topic perfectly, so as not to incur the reference to the topic that is present in the regulation - Norway is one of the main international producers of oil and one of the first exporters of natural gas in the world, so, even if it had all electric cars, clearly Norway does its own calculations and sells oil and natural gas to the whole world. Then at home it has electric cars and many praise the case of Norway. Brilliant. Let's get to our buses. Thank you, Councilor."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,50,"For the answer, the floor is given to Councillor Bertschy."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,UV,4,3917,"Returning to the Aosta Valley, to our buses and the connections with Malpensa, which are also smaller, lighter means of transport, as a connection; ""What were the results of this experiment during the summer months"": precisely because we are talking about experimentation, the connection was introduced in the past for the winter period and we decided to try to experiment it also in the summer periods. Exactly 839 people were transported between July and September. There is also the distributed timetable, where there was greater use. We also tried to introduce a night timetable, to try to connect to international connections that leave at other times. The experimentation is a positive experimentation. Probably the service - in fact we also spoke about it with Councillor Grosjacques, with the Office - should be advertised even more, information should be given both to the local population, but above all to tourists, that this possibility exists and exists in this experimental form. The objective is clear and should be to achieve... and I'm already coming to the second question: ""What reasons determined the specific limit of days of operation during the period carried out"": precisely because it is an experiment, we have tried to give this experiment a first part of organization linked to the periods of greater travel, in particular for the moments of arrival and departure of people. The ideal would be to be able to extend it, indeed, to have it completely at service throughout the week. It is also a question of cost evaluation, we must understand if, by implementing the service, the greater use can make the expense appropriate or if we then risk not having this optimization. For my part, for our part, there is no limit to reasoning in this sense. It is always a question of using resources in the best possible way and trying to do it in the best way to also guarantee the economic system, in particular the hotel system, an additional service for its customers. The evaluation was conducted, in fact, together with the carrier and the Hotel Association. This winter we will work to reason about next summer and to evaluate whether the service can be implemented. It seems like a good service to us, the assessment we give is that it is a useful, necessary service - especially given the phase we are experiencing with transport - and that it can give added value to our territory. As regards point 3, ""What intentions does the regional administration have regarding the new activation of the service and the possible limitation of operating days in the winter tourist period"", the service is in operation until 12/31 because the administrative planning could have been done with a commitment up to that date. We will shortly bring the commitment resolutions for the following years to the Council and obviously the service will continue during this winter and also during the next summer, with some changes to the timetable. As I was saying, we have also introduced departures from Aosta at 03:00 in the morning and at 05:30 from Friday to Sunday to Malpensa, because that is the time of arrival of international flights. Some assessments have been made; the service will continue, the goal is to make it grow and advertise it more and also to understand, directly from those who can benefit from it, if other improvements can be made, making it grow and knowing that we must make more resources available. It is a service that also requires payment by people, so it has a cost that, if used well, can be optimized, because, a bit like all transport services, if they bring added value this added value is then distributed throughout the territory and the related industries."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,5,44,"For the reply, the floor goes to my colleague Perron."
47952,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Trasporti, Aeroporti",en,Perron,Simone,1979,M,LEGA VDA,6,410,"We will make our assessment based on the data you provide us. You have rightly made your assessments and the company too, I can simply tell you that - since we had received reports that require implementation, probably with other assessments - if you could extend it to other days it wouldn't hurt and it could be an important service. That's all I can say to you, in the meantime I thank you."

47953,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,2,1636,"Let's return to the issue of the roundabout in the ex Fera area in the Municipality of Saint-Vincent. It is a topic we have already discussed on several occasions in this Regional Council, presenting inspection initiatives, most recently that of 17 April 2024. On that occasion, we were informed by the competent Councillor that the executive planning of the initiative was being updated and the necessary programme agreement to be stipulated with Anas was awaited. We have brought the issue back to the agenda today, because we believe it is an extremely dangerous situation. We see widespread attention on the territory, with the construction of roundabouts, but this topic has been discussed for several years, indeed, I could say that it has been more than ten years, and also another initiative, always on the Saint-Vincent ring road, which has not yet been examined, in correspondence with the cemetery area; these are situations in which there is a great need for intervention. We are surprised that nothing has yet been implemented in this area. There have been several inspections in the ex Fera area, even a few hundred meters after the Fera, where there is access to the Champcillien area, we also talked about this, with an extremely dangerous situation. Seven or eight people have already died in road accidents there and the situation is not being addressed. Therefore, with this initiative we want to ask whether the executive planning has finally been completed and whether the program agreement for the financing of the work has been defined."
47953,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,49,"For the answer, let's hear from Councilor Sapinet."
47953,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976,M,UV,4,4272,"Thank you, colleague Marquis, because this initiative allows us to give an update, to take stock after what we said, if I'm not mistaken, in April. Compared to the previous intervention in the spring, we can confirm the amount of funding planned for the state roads of our region, within the new program agreement between the Ministry of Infrastructure and Anas, an agreement that was approved with the Cipes resolution (Inter-ministerial Committee for Economic Planning and Sustainable Development) and was published in the Official Journal on July 10th. The new assignments, as we have already said - they are official - amount to 9 million, which are to be added to the 5 million already assigned in advance with resources from the 2021 and 2022 budget law. Therefore, on the certain basis of the amount of state funding, this administration has held a series of meetings with the technical structures of Anas, and another is scheduled for next week, to start the discussion on the projects to be included in the next update of the program agreement. We can therefore anticipate that, as a regional department, we have asked Anas that the future plan includes the construction of new roundabouts along the state road, more precisely therefore: in the municipality of Pont-Saint-Martin; in the municipality of Châtillon, at the intersection with via Pellissier; in the municipality of Saint-Denis, at the entrance to the regional road to Pontey: we have asked for the subdivision of an important intervention, which included the Pontey roundabout with the hamlet that is found arriving in Châtillon, therefore going to subdivide that intervention, giving priority to the Pontey roundabout; regarding the intervention that gives access to the municipality of Champdepraz, the construction of a roundabout, as already said in a previous question by colleague Brunod, is particularly complicated, but we are thinking about a safety intervention that will improve the current situation; finally in the Municipality of Saint-Vincent, with two requested interventions: the one in the Fera area, which was already partly planned, and the new roundabout at the intersection with the cemetery road, which you rightly mentioned. The second question: the roundabout in the Fera area is considered, both by the regional and municipal administrations, strategic for the industrial area as well as for making the area's traffic safe and could also constitute an improvement in the road infrastructure for the inhabitants and visitors of the neighboring hamlets, coming from the Municipality of Montjovet. Even before the formalization of this agreement, of the new state funding that we mentioned above, the construction of the Fera roundabout had been the subject of discussions with Anas, discussions that had led to the definition of the design process, which was shared with the municipal administration of Saint-Vincent; process started and in the process of being completed. Unlike the other roundabouts mentioned above, in fact, the Fera roundabout had an advanced stage of development, in fact Anas had already acquired part of the design. In this regard, we urged Anas, which informed us that the design update is nearing completion and is expected to be completed by the end of the current year. The works for the construction of the Fera roundabout are included by Anas in the intervention called AO 280, which also includes the roundabouts of Verrayes, in the Champagne area, and Morgex, at the height of the motorway junction. This was included among the adaptation and safety interventions of the 2016-2020 program contract, which was therefore re-proposed in the new 2021-2025 program contract, to cover the additional economic needs compared to the funds previously allocated. We had these 5 million, which were in fact the surplus with the project of these two roundabouts, Verrayes and Morgex, within which Fera had already been inserted. The 5 million did not cover everything, with the new allocation of these 9, which brings the total to 14 million, here is the total coverage of this roundabout, plus those I had mentioned a little while ago."
47953,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,5,63,"For the reply, the floor is given to colleague Marquis, he has the right to do so."
47953,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Viabilità",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,6,1247,"English: Perhaps we are finally getting to the point of realizing the result. Since the executive design is still being updated and since we had already talked about it and I also mentioned earlier that the roundabout in Fera is nearby, near the Champcillien junction, so there are still 200-300 meters of road to go, and you had done the inspection with Anas at the time, which revealed the extreme danger of that situation, where I said before that there have already been numerous deaths; I believe it is worth urging Anas or checking that the remediation and redevelopment of that situation have also been included. Otherwise, it will not be possible to get to grips with different practices, if it is not included in this initiative. I would invite you, Councilor, to check this, because otherwise there are huge risks in that situation, if we cannot reduce the risk that exists today, because it is extremely dangerous. We note with satisfaction that it seems that the work has been financed. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation from now on, to avoid further delays compared to those that have already occurred up to now."

During the initiative it was reported that in Italy in the 15-17 age group 30% declared they smoked"", we point out that within the aforementioned article the National Coordination of Teachers of the Human Rights Subject reiterated the urgency of intensifying awareness campaigns on the phenomenon of smoking among adolescents also through the planning of some lessons on the harms of tobacco in the presence of health specialists in the sector; we note that as of today... but today was referring to October 4th because the initiative is obviously an old initiative, which is reported on the official website uslvda.it, there are some pages and sections relating to the prevention of the regional prevention plan that report the wording: ""pages under construction"". We have verified in recent days that the page relating to prevention has been completed, so it is no longer under construction, while, as regards the regional prevention plan section, there is still a section that is under construction; we recall that on December 6, 2021, the regional prevention plan 2021-2025 was approved with Regional Council resolution no. 1654. This plan identifies ten predefined programs and three free regional programs, integrated and transversal, with which it is intended to implement all the macro objectives and all the strategic objectives of the national prevention plan 2020-2025. The competent Councillors are therefore asked to know: what the situation is today in the regional territory compared to what is represented at the national level, how many and which initiatives are promoted by the respective Departments regarding awareness against the harms of smoking in schools and also in general, that is without considering the classic days or anniversaries; if there is an intention to promote and intensify new activities, projects and awareness campaigns against the harms of smoking in the regional territory."

47954,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,6058,"Coming to question no. 1: ""how is the situation in the regional territory compared to what is represented at the national level"", we return to a topic that has already been the subject of debate during the Regional Council in July. The data we report are taken from the PASSI 2022-2023 surveillance. In Valle d'Aosta, among adults aged 18-69, 60.6% (Italian data 58.7) of those interviewed are non-smokers, 13.7% (Italian data 16.8) can be classified as ex-smokers, 25.7% (Italian data 24.5) are smokers. Among those interviewed, 24% said they smoked every day. With reference to young people, a 2022 study on health-related behaviors in school-age children photographed and monitored the health of Italian adolescents aged 11, 13 and 15 and, for the first time, also of 17-year-olds. The picture of the schools in the Aosta Valley that emerged is improving as it is characterized by a perception of adequacy of the structures and attention to health promotion activities. As regards smoking, the study shows that the majority of the children interviewed declared that they had never smoked. The percentage of non-smokers decreases with increasing age, going from 99% of eleven-year-olds to 96.6% of thirteen-year-olds up to 89.5 of fifteen-year-olds. The data also tell us that from 2019 to today the habit of smoking has significantly decreased, in fact the percentage of young people in the Aosta Valley who have never smoked has gone from 78.6% in 2018 to 92.2 in 2022. Coming to question no. 2, attention to prevention related to smoking is included in the regional prevention plan, as you mentioned, in particular within the ""Schools that promote health"" program, and identifies some strategic lines of intervention aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles in the school context, including the fight against the consumption of tobacco and nicotine products. In the 2023-2024 school year, with the Coordination of the Superintendence of Studies of colleague Guichardaz, whom we thank for his contribution, awareness-raising courses on smoking and other addictions were presented in schools on this topic, consolidated over time, on the initiative of LILT Val d'Aosta, with the active involvement of the first and second classes of secondary school and a project for the recovery, use and recycling of disposable electronic cigarettes carried out at ISILTEP in Verrès. As regards the ""Addictions"" program, always included in the regional prevention plan, the specific actions, including health promotion, are implemented by the consolidated activity of the Addictions service of the USL Company. The Ser.D. in fact has within it a micro team dedicated to the treatment of nicotine use disorder, composed of a doctor and a psychologist. From the data updated to July 2024, it emerges that 31 patients have been taken care of by the Ser.D., including one minor. In May of this year, the members of the aforementioned team participated in a radio broadcast aimed at the entire population. In the prevention activities carried out with students of lower and upper secondary schools within the scope of the Interinstitutional Table for educational co-responsibility and legality by the Ser.D. operators, the focus is on addictions, naturally in all their aspects. Smoking is treated together with other substance and behavioral addictions. An awareness-raising event aimed at institutions took place on May 31, 2022 at the Fondazione Sistema Ollignan Onlus entitled ""The seduction of smoking"", financed with restricted ministerial funds. Coming to question no. 3, as we have already anticipated during the work of the Regional Council last July, in response to an initiative on the topic of baby smokers, we confirm that within the ""Addictions"" program of the regional prevention plan, in collaboration with the Ser.D. of the USL Company, the planning for 2025 of an awareness-raising activity against smoking is in the initial phase. The initiative is aimed at the younger generations and intends to use forms of communication that are more responsive to the target of the very young people to whom it is addressed and to intercept young people both in school and extracurricular environments.In terms of raising awareness among the youth world, we also inform you that the Youngle project is being implemented by the Ser.D., entrusted to ""Essere Umani onlus"", which aims at primary and secondary prevention and is aimed at the adolescent population. The presentation press conference, among other things, was held on October 9th and had an excellent response. It is in fact a web app, therefore a web application, in which the young person can chat anonymously with a peer about their problems: from sexuality to relationships, naturally up to substances. The peer educators, that is, the peer educators, are trained and supervised by professionals and can recommend a referral to dedicated services if necessary. They will also form the editorial team responsible for opening social pages in which to convey messages aimed at current lifestyles, including abstention from smoking. A further strengthening of the therapeutic options, therefore secondary prevention, will be given to the use - soon to be introduced - also of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of nicotine use disorder, alongside other treatment aids. We have introduced this treatment in the additional regional LEA with resolution no. 1082/2024 and the treatment will be free for the entire resident population of the Aosta Valley. We remind you that we are the only and first Region at the moment to have included transcranial in the additional free LEA for its population."

47954,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978,M,RV,6,2787,"I tried to follow her carefully in her response on this topic, which certainly deserves a lot of importance. It is a very complete, very technical response, where she provided a lot of data. Obviously we wanted to underline that we re-presented this initiative even though one had already been made by colleague Lucianaz in July, because within the response that she had already provided then there were still data, which she has now reconfirmed to me, of studies done in 2022. Since this article, which we cited in the introduction, came out at the end of September 2024, reporting data at a national level, we wanted to understand the picture at a regional level updated to today to understand if further investigations had been done or there was the possibility of undertaking new paths to have more up-to-date data, which give a general picture of the most up-to-date problem regarding this problem of the effects of smoking. English: You answered us in a complete way, but reporting in your answer much of what had already been reported in July, therefore on the various initiatives that the department is undertaking we are pleased, obviously focusing attention through these inspection initiatives on issues on which we are convinced that everyone is paying the utmost attention, trying to do more and more excellent work, more and more synergy between what is health, education, youth world, to try to reduce these problems as much as possible, but above all to raise awareness. At the same time, as has been reiterated in this article that we have cited, through these initiatives, these projects, that there is an increasing presence of health specialists in the sector who bring in a better way, in a more representative way, but at a technical level the situations and above all the problems to make people understand what we can face. Our attention will always be very much on this issue, we trust that there are increasingly important projects in this regard. Here too you told me what had already been reported in July that in collaboration with the Ser.D. is in the initial planning phase for 2025. This is what you said today and it is the same thing that was reported in July, so we understood that, in this respect, we are still in the development phase of this project. We have not had any major details ahead precisely because it is probably still in the development phase. It will certainly be very important to start in a complete and in-depth way under this topic, as we have already reiterated, so later we will return to the topic, not in a critical and polemical way, but to bring attention to this problem together."
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,200,"Given the absence of Councilor Restano, which we have received, we move on to the interpellation registered under point no. 74 of the agenda. Councilor Aggravi illustrates the interpellation, he has the right to do so."
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,2,3778,"Within the health and social welfare plan there are two objectives: MA 4.2 and MA 5.4, reported in the premises. The first aims to reorganize governance within the regional welfare system, with specific reference to the separation of the social policy programming function from the service management function through the establishment of an instrumental body to which the management of social-welfare services will be entrusted, including the socio-professional service, as an essential level of social benefits. The second aims to establish the control room for the definition of the new organizational and management structure of social services and interventions, the preparation of a feasibility study for the establishment of an instrumental body and the manager of social services and the revision of the Valle d'Aosta area plan. The initiative is from October 4th. At the previous Council, a question was discussed with Councilor Marzi entitled: ""News on the meetings of representatives of the Regional Government with cooperative societies in relation to the future management of micro communities"", during which the Councilor had already partly given a piece, which was then useful for the preparation of this interpellation, in particular the contents of resolution no. 282, therefore of the control room and also of the assignment to an external body with proven skills and experience in the field of programming and review of organizational, procedural, management models of services in the context of social policies to be supported by the structures of social policies. We then found in the Economic and Financial Document in two sections, one relating to the Presidency of the Region, a passage, of which I quote a part, namely the fact that the appropriate assessments will be carried out regarding the evolution of the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta S.p.A. and the services provided by it in order to rethink the legal structure with particular reference to the new needs for the provision of social, social-welfare and socio-educational services. A part then in the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, which in fact takes up the objectives that have been represented in the health and social welfare plan. What we ask the Councilor is: ""if the potential ""constituting"" instrumental body, as mentioned in the two passages of the Regional Economic and Financial Document, corresponds to the same""; I apologize for the typo, not ""the same"", obviously. It seems like a trivial question, but in reality it is not, because objectively even in the DEFR hearings the doubt has arisen every now and then, even in those of the previous DEFR, so at least the question is clear and we will have, I hope, but I am sure, a clear answer. The other questions are: ""what directions were given to the external body entrusted with the support of the offices of the Department of Social Policies with the resolution of the Regional Council - which I have already mentioned - in particular whether among these there are, among other things, indications regarding the assessments regarding the evolution of the Service Company; whether it is intended to involve any third sector bodies during the performance of the activities relating to the support referred to in the previous point and, if so, in what terms; whether in light of the possible creation of the instrumental body referred to in the premises, the Regional Government intends to keep the Valle d'Aosta Service Company ""alive""? I wanted to make it simple, so we have given human life to a company? so deprived of the provision of services in the social, social-welfare and socio-educational fields""."
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councilor Marzi responds.
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,6437,"The identification in section 3 of the DEFR 2025-2027, was actually already present in that of 2024-2026, of strategic objectives regarding the management of social services both of the Presidency of the Region and of the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, tends to the same purpose. On the one hand, the focus of the Presidency of the Region is to evaluate the evolution of the Valle d'Aosta Service Company in order to rethink its legal structure, in particular with regard to the provision of social, socio-welfare and socio-educational services. The need underlying the objective expressed in the part of the Department of my responsibility concerns the reorganization of the system of social-welfare services, maintaining the function of programming territorial social policies in the Department, delegating the management of the services to a third party. The objectives therefore respond to the same purpose of evolution in the provision of social services. The question was not only irrelevant, but, in some ways, we must be grateful because, as we have said on various occasions, probably not very effectively, the fact of answering as I have just finished answering, I hope, has the effect of avoiding this type of doubt. Coming to question no. 2: ""what directions were given to the external body that was entrusted with supporting the offices of the Department of Social Policies with DGR 282/2024 and, in particular, whether among these services there are, among other things, indications regarding the evaluation regarding the evolution of the Valle d'Aosta Service Company"", with reference to the directions given to the Poleis company, which is assisting the offices of the Region in preparing the feasibility study, the following was requested. The feasibility study will have to develop a proposal for the establishment of the instrumental body and for the revision of the Aosta Valley area plan in a study report that provides: first point, an assessment of the legal nature that the instrumental body to be established will have to assume, comparing its respective characteristics, strengths and any critical points, also with the aim of applying the public contract to all employees of the future instrumental body, you will remember that this point was treated precisely within the reference Commission by the undersigned in the hearing of the DEFR. Point 2, the assessment of the economic-organizational sustainability concerning the creation of an instrumental body responsible for the management of personal services, with specific reference to the following services: professional social services, services for people with disabilities, residential services for the elderly, residential services for minors, socio-educational services for minors. The study will specifically develop the following aspects: the organizational chart of the instrumental body, the optimal unit cost of the service, the structure of the profit and loss account and balance sheet, criteria and methods of participation of the members in the financing of the company, organizational methods aimed at ensuring the coordination of the social policy programming function with the function of managing personal services, with specific reference to the reorganization of the competences of the Social Policy Department in relation to the activities delegated to the company. Point 3: a model for reviewing the functions and methods of operation of the regional area plan, as a tool for programming regional social and socio-health policies integrated with other sectoral policies. The study project also includes support for the structures of the Regional Administration in preparing the bill aimed at establishing, precisely, the instrumental body and the related report. Coming to question no. 3 ""whether it is intended to involve any third sector entities during the performance of the activities relating to the support referred to in the previous point and, if so, in what terms"", it is beyond our understanding why it would be necessary or appropriate to involve third sector entities during the performance of the activities relating to the preparation of the feasibility study. This is a feasibility study for the establishment of: i an instrumental body of the Region, therefore at this moment the regional structures involved are working together with the company entrusted with the technical assistance, therefore the structures pertaining to labor policies, the Department of Social Policies and of course the Superintendence of Studies, in addition to the involvement of the Department of Personnel and the Management of Service Companies. Once the feasibility study is completed, whose delivery is scheduled for the end of the current year, all the assessments, including political ones, of the case can be made and therefore the trade unions and the relevant stakeholders will be involved, as already communicated to them, including of course the third sector bodies that are represented, among other things, in the tables of the area plan for the concertation phase. At the moment therefore we are still in the preparation phase of the feasibility study which, as you can imagine, absolutely expresses a whole series of complexities to which an answer must be given, those recalled, in fact, in the answer to question no. 2. Once this phase is completed, the feasibility study will provide useful elements for political discussion and with the relevant stakeholders regarding the establishment of the instrumental body. Coming to question no. 4 ""whether, in light of the possible creation of the instrumental body mentioned in the premises, the Regional Government intends to keep alive the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta S.p.A., thus deprived of the provision of services in the social, social-welfare and socio-educational fields"", as is known, you know better than I, the Società di Servizi Valle d'Aosta guarantees the provision of a whole series of activities, not only in the area of ​​personal services, but also with regard to services related to culture, forestry construction and road works. For these activities it would therefore remain operational."
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,31,Councillor Aggravi replies.
47955,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,6,2273,"Councillor, do you remember the proof of 9? It didn't always work, but it was useful to understand if the numbers added up. My question no. 3 had a similar purpose to the proof of 9, it's not certain that it works, but at least for the moment it makes me understand that the calculations more or less add up. The first question, yes, answers the doubts or, better, it was thought that there was a need at least to have a clear answer, also because, as you rightly recalled, the same indication was already present in the previous DEFR, but already at the time we had some doubts and the hearings organised already last time had not given a univocal, or in any case clear, answer. Let's take note of the elements that constitute the assignment given to the consultancy firm, we will see what the final outcome will be. Obviously there are two issues on which I would like to focus more than anything else. I repeat: it is a banal observation but you will accept it. Certainly the company's financing structure... I say this because, also with respect to what was already said in a previous question, it should never be trivialized or simplified, because obviously once you start it is good that the structure is well defined so as not to have to run for cover. It will also be important to understand the methods relating to the application of the public contract considering that today we have a company reality that, although publicly owned, still has its own specificity, so we will see what the results of the study will be. As for the last question, yes, it is true, perhaps this too may have seemed a trivial question, but perhaps it should be discussed more in the context of the overall management of the subsidiaries than in the context of its specific delegations. It is true, it remains in place for other purposes, however, also seeing some indications or in any case clarifications that are made in the latest reports on the management of the company's budget, or in any case also in the context of the planning documents, it is obvious that a further evaluation will have to be made to avoid that the company has some lack of profitability in the face of the loss, allow me a parallel, of the business units, which obviously will go within the scope of the instrumental body."
47956,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,92,"Item no. 75. Councillor Manfrin has asked to speak for the illustration, he has the right to do so."
47956,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,2,3387,"With this interpellation we return to the topic of autism, because we talked about it on the occasion of the regional economic and financial document in which in the part dedicated to social policies, and evidently also to disability, a series of interventions were highlighted, a series of actions, a bit - let's say in quotation marks, forgive the term, it's not the correct one, but just to be clear - to ""boast"" what have been the things implemented by virtue of the ministerial funds that are made available. In the meantime, a verification that we carried out directly with the Ministry, as well as... a letter that we then wanted to report, there are large excerpts of it in the interpellation, but it is a letter that was sent both to the members of the V Commission and evidently, I imagine, also to you, Councilor, however the ANGSA association directly highlighted some critical issues and above all raised an alarm. As we reported in the text of the interpellation, the association intends to share the concern about the timing of implementation of the ministerial decrees of January 24 and February 6, 2023 and, in particular, this is the central part of this interpellation, regarding the funds allocated to basic or applied research, to the increase in the staff of the national health service, to training initiatives, to the development of the territorial network and individualized life projects and to the improvement of assistance to people with autism spectrum disorder. We know that some discussions had taken place precisely on this, some fruitful because it must absolutely be recognized when there are positive parts, others less so, but more than for lack of will, let's say for the issue of the tight timing. In fact, the association writes: ""More than a year later, it is clear that the aforementioned decrees have not yet been implemented in the health sector. Recalling the need for an early, systemic and long-life intervention program, in the face of more than 200 people with autism in the regional territory, whose needs are still awaiting answers, ANGSA VdA hereby intends to urge the competent structures to promptly implement the aforementioned decrees"". With this letter, the association evidently intends to illuminate, highlight, and make known what is a bit of a critical issue, namely the delays. In fact, the association writes: ""The failure to use the funds within the appropriate timeframe and their consequent return to the Ministry would constitute a serious missed opportunity, which would harm the entire population with autism and the families of the area, compromising the improvement of their quality of life, the possibility of recovery and enhancement of residual abilities and frustrating the implementation of the expected new services, with important repercussions in the care of new generations of subjects with autism"". It is therefore clear that an alarm raised, I believe, in a polite manner by the association absolutely deserves a response, obviously equally polite, but I know that you are, Councilor, to understand if these funds can actually be used, with what timing and to avoid that they may be lost, that therefore they cannot be used."
47956,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,47,"For the answer, let's hear from Councilor Marzi."
47956,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,3975,"I answer the two questions, namely ""what are the reasons for the delay highlighted by the ANGSA VdA association and whether every useful action has been prepared to use the funds in a timely manner"". First of all, it is important to underline how the dialogue between the Department and the USL Company is constant and continuous also on the topic of autism. With regard to the funds in particular, with the resolution of the Regional Council n. 628/2023, the activity plans concerning autism spectrum disorders were approved to be used on the funds referred to in the ministerial decree of 24 January 2023, for a total of just over 302,000 euros, and the ministerial decree of 6 February 2023, for 269,591 euros. The latter includes: the study of basic or applied research projects, the increase in the number of personnel of the national health service responsible for providing the interventions envisaged by the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders, developed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, the implementation of training initiatives, the development of a territorial network with the function of recognition, diagnosis and early intervention on neurodevelopmental disorders and individualized life projects based on the concept of quality of life. The purposes and initiatives are aimed at improving assistance to people with autism spectrum disorders both in terms of effectiveness in relation to the quality of life of those affected and their families, and in terms of organizational adaptation of the regional health and social-assistance networks. All of this was naturally shared with the regional technical table, established with the resolution of the Council n. 1633 dating back to 2017, which includes, among others, representatives of the two departments of the Department of Health, Health and Social Policies, the Department of Superintendence of Studies, the Department of Labor and Training Policies, the University of Valle d'Aosta, the USL Company, including general practitioners and pediatricians of free choice, associations of relatives of subjects affected by autism spectrum disorder, in addition to significant support also guaranteed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. Regarding institutional courtesy, the technical table meets periodically and the meetings have always been fruitful opportunities for discussion and sharing, as also highlighted in the letter you mentioned... I quote ""recognizing the merits of the Department of having maintained constant attention to the resources made available by the National Fund"". The topic of programming and carrying out activities related to funding was also the subject of analysis in all meetings of the technical table that met during the current year on March 7, June 21 and August 7. The technical table will soon be reconvened, providing for an update, as also requested by ANGSA, regarding the interventions envisaged by the activity plans within the ministerial funds in question. Among the various actions to be taken advantage of the aforementioned funds already implemented in order to provide a response to the increase in cases of diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, we can mention the increase in human, professional and trained resources dedicated to existing services, the increase in individualized therapeutic plans, as well as the activation of support paths for school, social and work inclusion. Periodic technical meetings are also currently being held between the Department and the USL Company focused on the development of the territorial care network. At the moment, therefore, the programming and the activity already underway provide for the use of state resources for the purposes decided. Finally, we inform that the project proposal for both the new 2024 and 2025 funds has also been submitted to the Ministry."

It is quite clear that the letter that arrived after, obviously, the convocation of the technical table and before the convocation of the one you announced, therefore the next one, therefore the last convocation dates back to August, underlines and highlights a problem and a need. For maximum transparency, I highlighted that there was an active collaboration with the Department. You wanted to emphasize it, but I had obviously said it too. However, it is equally clear that, if everything were actually without any critical issues, this letter would not have been necessary. I obviously thank you for your response, the hope I can make is that the technical table can meet as soon as possible, therefore when you announced the convocation... and that from this there can then be some positive news, because it is clear that the alarm raised is certainly worrying, therefore the fears are absolutely well-founded.

We are talking about free additional services in healthcare. What are free additional services? They are those services that management staff and healthcare sector staff, and not only, perform or have the right to perform to reduce waiting lists and reduce the use of outsourcing. These services are paid with a sum that is predetermined on the basis of a company agreement, where the trade union forces also intervene. The State financial law, no. 13/2023, in paragraphs 218, 219 and 220, has allowed these sums to be raised, determining a maximum figure and an amount to be allocated to the Regions. Valle d'Aosta benefits from an amount, which is equal to 588,000 euros, of which 420 for management staff and 168,000 for sector staff. Following this determination, the Regional Council, through a Council resolution, which for us was made in April 2024, at no. 405, determines the destination of these sums. The Council, led by President Testolin, has decided, on the proposal of the Councilor and after consultation with the trade unions, to allocate this amount only to the personnel who deal with the emergency urgency, determining an hourly compensation of 100 euros for the medical management staff and 60 euros for the health personnel of the health sector. With the interpellation we ask what are the reasons behind the choice to recognize different hourly spending commitments between the emergency urgency and the other departments, when the reference standard allows to proceed with the same figures in all the structures and if there is the intention to adjust the amounts also for the other structures where the possibility of carrying out the LPA aimed at reducing waiting lists and reducing the use of outsourcing is foreseen.

In light of the aforementioned legislation, the Department, the USL Company and the trade unions agreed on the need to maintain the company freelance profession for the emergency and internalizations at the value of 100 euros per hour for medical managers and at the value of 60 euros per hour for healthcare personnel in the healthcare sector up to the capacity of the allocated budget. For all other cases, the contractual rule for doctors was applied in the minimum amount of 80 euros. This agreement has its rationale in the following considerations. First of all, the budget for the Company Free Profession, the LPA, both the one connected to the financial and the contractual one, is defined and non-derogable. An increase to the maximum value of all services would in fact have significantly reduced the overall hours that could be provided and, consequently, reduced the services obtainable for citizens. Secondly, all hours, even those paid at the minimum value of 80 euros per hour, have guaranteed doctors a considerable increase in compensation (+30%) compared to the previous remuneration of 60 euros per hour. Legislative Decree no. 73/2024 on waiting lists in Article 7 has also provided, and you know it, for everyone a tax discount on LPA hours, moving to an Irpef taxation of 15%, i.e. the substitute tax on additional services of healthcare personnel, thus generating an increase in the net value paid to workers. Emergency services, by their nature, cannot be delayed or not provided and already provided for the treatment of 100 euros per hour. These are the ones for which it is necessary to give priority and guarantee continuity to the compensation already guaranteed. The services related to internalization are also equally a priority, also due to the provisions that have blocked the possibility of renewal or a new call for outsourcing of services, even in the absence of staff as you know, see article 10 of 34/2023. For example, the third emergency department clinic and emergency department radiology had to be taken over by the dependent staff upon expiration of the contract. The hourly value brought to 100 euros for doctors has effectively allowed the service to be maintained unchanged, moving from the token operators to the staff of the radiology facility, as, among other things, has often been requested within this Council. Colleague Restano, and you know this for the ongoing relationships with your Company, it was the operators themselves, due to the sense of responsibility that distinguishes them, who wanted to give the maximum figure of 100 euros a connotation of exceptionality. What I can tell you about these initiatives is also linked to the fact that your questions are part of a logical discourse that does not see the workers in the sector, doctors, nurses and all 26 health professions working for this exceptionality. You will agree with me that this is the approach, on which questions like yours can then be asked, which makes it clear that these tools, LP and LPA, are additional tools that serve to provide an answer to a problem that is very difficult to manage. Other types of approaches do not grasp the connection of exceptionality. In some other questions of the day it almost seems that for some the exceptionality wants to be the norm, but, as you point out with your question, this is not the case."

The interpellation wants to highlight that, since the State law, which sets clear and evident limits on the basis of which you have moved, in Article 118 establishes as a prerogative that the financing is aimed at reducing waiting lists and the use of outsourcing, it does not set limits to the departments, but by applying it in this way and, I repeat, you do it within the terms of the law, it is reduced on one side, but it is increased on the other. There are equally urgent tests, of a radiological or other type, which are not affected by the LPA or at least cannot be affected to date. The purpose of the interpellation is to invite you to try to find a different solution, that is to allow further investment in the Company, in free company services or, to define them in another way, in free services within the Company, so as to avoid the continuous recourse to companies outside the Valley by the people of the Aosta Valley, or to outsourcing, which evidently do not bring advantages to the economy, bring damage to the environment, risks to health and are starting to become a social problem. I believe that these four reasons are sufficient to go in derogation of certain rules or at least to ask you to want to look into the matter in more depth, therefore meeting the needs of the population and also incentivizing health professionals."
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,72,Item no. 76. Councilor Minelli has asked to speak and has the floor.
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,2,5103,"The Regional Council, with resolution no. 1086 of 9 September 2024, established the technical political table and the control room for the reorganization and strengthening of the regional system of interventions and services for people with disabilities. This table will have to deal in particular with the revision of law no. 14/2008. The resolution also starts the procedure to identify an external subject who will have to draw up the feasibility study for the period 2024/2025. In the text of my interpellation a part of the title of resolution no. 1086 has gone out, I apologize. However, the text shows the will of the Region to reform the Aosta Valley system regarding disability, with the support of technical assistance and it is a fully shared objective. In relation to this important intervention that will take place, in the past weeks, now a month ago and more, we received the letter sent by one of the associations that deal with disability in our territory: the Famiglie 162 Committee for the implementation of law no. 162 in Valle d'Aosta. In this letter we are reminded that ""any reform of the rules that concern the world of disability must take place in the wake of law no. 227/2021 ""Delegation to the Government on disability matters"" and with reference to the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities"". These are documents that we have already had the opportunity to discuss in this chamber and we have also done so in the Commissions. In addition to the aforementioned law, no. 227, we must also take into account the important implementing decrees that have been issued by the national Government, which provide for the launch of policies for the deinstitutionalization of services, what we could define as standard services, with increasing attention to forms of personalized support. This is an important paradigm shift, considered very positive for many personal situations, by those who have always been concerned with the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. : The request that specifically comes from Committee 162 regarding the definition of the new system is a request that we know is shared by many other associations and is aimed at working so that this new system - I quote from the letter - ""is not aimed at thinking of new or better services intended as places, walls, dedicated spaces, or segregating, but is aimed at creatively designing new methods, which allow each citizen with disabilities to have support that compensates for their impairment or fragility to give concreteness to their life project in everyone's world"". This seems to me to be an objective as important as it is challenging, which expresses with great clarity the need to respect the individuality of people with disabilities and to concretely take charge of everyone's life project, a project that unfortunately often has to be scaled down and revised due to obstacles arising from an assistance system that also needs to be revised and strengthened. Also because, I recall, the UN Convention, which has become Italian State law, n. 162/1998, from which the association I mentioned takes its name, establishes that ""the person with a disability has the right to choose where, with whom and how to live"". The Families Committee 162 then expresses the hope of being able to participate together with all the other stakeholders in the process of reviewing the regional law: n. 14/2008 and, more generally, in the reorganization of the regional system of interventions and services for people with disabilities. It is true that in the resolution I mentioned, n. 1086, it is stated that the working table will also include representatives of the associations that deal with disabilities in the region, however, given that reference is normally made to the most representative associations, precisely because it is usually so, we understand a wish on the part of this association, but also on the part of other associations, which express the same hope, that is, to be a truly active part of this important process of review, because we know that it will then have consequences on the entire regional disability system. It is for these reasons that we ask the Government to know whether the assessments that led to the formulation of the resolution have examined in depth the law no. 227/2021 and whether the legislative decree has been taken into account.ivo n. 62 of 3 May 2024, which is specific to personalized life projects. We ask this because the letter we received rightly refers to the fact that is not mentioned in the resolution. It is important to understand it because it truly outlines processes of evaluation and preparation of personalized life projects with methods that are new compared to the past. The second question is: ""if there is the intention to involve the various associations that in Valle d'Aosta deal with disabilities and that intend to actively collaborate in the process of reviewing the law""."
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councilor Marzi responds.
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,2623,"With reference to the interpellation presented by my colleague, which is based on the note sent to me and the Councillors responsible for disability by the Family Committee 162 for the implementation of law no. 162 in the Aosta Valley, I am responding today, as I noted, together with the Coordinator of the Department of Social Policies, on 9 October last, to the President of the Committee 162. The planned reform of regional law no. 14/2008 is necessary because, in addition to being a rather dated system - we talked about it when we talked about the DEFR and I am pleased that, when it comes to making interpellations, it is made known that at least the process of reviewing no. 14 has started - precisely following the approval of the delegation law no. 227/2021 and the related implementing decrees, it is more urgent than ever to rethink policies in favor of people with disabilities that are respectful of the most recent guidelines on the matter deriving both from the aforementioned national regulatory framework and, as you recalled, from the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In this sense, the fact that the text of resolution no. 1086/2024 refers to delegation law no. 227/2024 and not to the subsequent implementing legislative decrees should not be understood as a devaluation of the implementing provisions but, on the contrary, as a desire to adopt those principles and purposes expressed in the delegation law, which are then subject to detailed regulation in the decrees approved by the Government. Coming to the second question, namely ""whether it is the intention to involve the various associations in Valle d'Aosta that deal with disabilities and that intend to actively collaborate in the process of reviewing regional law no. 14/2008"", I believe I can state, as is also clear from the resolution of the Council no. 1086, that this process intends to be as participatory as possible, giving the widest space both to the stakeholders and to all those who wish to collaborate, as already happened on the occasion of the launch of regional law no. 14/2008, which already followed an absolutely participatory path. It is also important to recall, but you mentioned it, that in the resolution of the Regional Council no. 1086 there is talk of a technical table and a control room with a technical composition and that in the technical table it is expressly recalled that representatives of the associations for people with disabilities will be involved and, based on the topics discussed, other subjects may also be called to participate."
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,51,"For the reply, the floor is given to Councilor Minelli."
47958,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Disabili, Associazionismo - volontariato",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,6,1647,"Thank you Councillor. When you ask a question, you acknowledge that the process has started and here it could not have been done differently because the resolution is clear: the process has started, we know, thank goodness, it was also written in the DEFR. I imagine that your introductory note made in the speech refers in some way to the other process that has started and started with a delayed fuse. When things work, they say, when they work less, they say the same. Beyond this, the interpellation was essentially aimed at receiving reassurances and the second answer that you gave is indeed reassuring or, better, confirms what was expected, however, given that often then those who participate, as also happens in other areas, are the most representative associations, the concern was to be able to all be there. It seems to me that you have confirmed this, so it is certainly good news. On question no. 1 you say: we absolutely did not want to devalue the decree that I cited, that is, no. 62 of 3 May, we included in the citation of law no. 227 also those that were the subsequent steps. Maybe, that's fine. I believe that, considering the importance of that decree, it could have been cited, precisely because in that decree reference is made in a very precise and very timely manner to the issue of the change of the new rules that exist with respect to the extension of a personalized life project, which already existed in the past but which now has a value and a structure that is certainly different and more important. In any case, thank you for your reply."
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,72,Item no. 77. Councillor Manfrin has asked to speak and has the floor.
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,2,8175,"With this initiative we discuss a topic that, unfortunately, often comes back to the fore and how, despite ourselves, we must take note that every opportunity that in theory should serve to wage a just battle against violence and I want to reiterate against any violence, wherever it comes from and whoever it is directed against, is absolutely important. Imagine the surprise when, looking at the resolutions that have come out, we see that two projects have been funded: one costing 10,000 euros and the other more or less the same: 9,990 euros. I am particularly struck by the title of this initiative, because an initiative against violence is called: ""Sex Joy, for non-violent affectivity"". Moreover, I also went to look at the definition of ""affectivity"" and the dictionary says: ""In psychology, a dynamic complex of various feelings"". We will probably talk about feelings, but ""Sex Joy"" left me with some doubts before... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...well, yes, in my opinion, that was the intention. We then did the appropriate in-depth analysis to understand what this project consisted of and we drew a series of ideas from this project, which also earned me the title of I don't remember what a well-known page, a well-known far-left political group, wrote to me. ""Andrea de Torquemada"" perhaps they called me. I wanted to reassure that obviously I will continue to deserve this title. The project tells us that ""the project intends to prevent gender violence and eradicate sexist stereotypes thanks to targeted actions, of an informative and educational nature, but also artistic and cultural, which promote gender equality among the younger segments of the population"". This English is nice because it muddies the waters a little, it tries a little to mask in a positive way what is brought. It is said that ""the first area of ​​objectification of women is precisely the erotic experience"" and they write ? it seems like a political manifesto for this project -: ""we want to bring to the center of local debate issues that still struggle to enter the public agenda due to fear and taboos, with the aim of countering the discriminatory and patriarchal culture in which gender violence is rooted"". A manifesto that seems to me to be reading a little... let's go back to the topic of Trump's victory, which we have happily acknowledged... the topic that some inconsolable feminists have brought up: we have not talked enough about these things, we have not managed to get this issue into the political agenda and therefore people have not voted as we wanted, they have voted in a slightly different way, which we did not like. In short, this project tells us that ""the patriarchal cultural system in which all forms of gender violence are rooted is struggling to defuse"". So essentially the problem is the patriarchal system. I also looked up the definition of ""patriarchal"" and ""patriarchy"" and it is rather curious. I won't read it to you because you know it well, but I certainly don't think it's the root of all evil. They always write in the project ""'Sex Joy, for non-violent affectivity"" ? we always have this contrast between sex and affectivity, which, in my opinion, has little to do with violence ?: ""it places the theme of sexual and affective education at the center of the interventions"". With this project against violence, that is, they want to provide sexual education, at least that's what they say. I won't tell you the name of the person who proposed it, but it's curious because they are in this association, I don't know how to define it... it's called APS, the same people who also do projects for the Municipality of Aosta, little projects for the Region always on the same theme, a little assignment here, a little assignment there. It's curious, they are always the same people who go around and take money. It almost seems like they live off this, that is, that their main activity is to do these projects. It is a danger, because evidently a person tends not to want to solve problems perhaps if these problems give them a living. So this is another issue that I put on the table. Obviously I am not saying that this is the case, but in general, if this type of disclosure becomes a profession, the risk is created. These associations say that ""the project is constituted in various interventions on the themes of gender violence, sexuality and gender equality in the artistic fieldico, cultural, informative and educational"". There are a whole series of descriptions, which I will cut out of love for my country. At point no. 3 of a list of objectives it is said, among other things, that ""we want to spread the discipline of consent, opening the discussion on future scenarios of the relationship between men and women export""... ""export"" is actually written and this is an error that unfortunately is reported in the project, you can see that it is written quite hastily. Moreover here among the subjects proposing the pages, I pointed it out before to another colleague... there are some other errors that are particularly funny. ""Spread the discipline of consent, man-woman relationship, export the themes of contrast to patriarchal culture outside the so-called ""feminist bubble"""". In other words, we are all feminists, we must involve men too, let's get them involved in this beautiful political battle. As for spreading the discipline of consent, I honestly don't understand what it means: in other words, do we have to explain that consent is needed between two people in order to have an emotional relationship of the type described in ""Sex Joy""? Because if that's the case, I'm reminded of that fantastic speech that a prosecutor gave a few years ago, who told how immigrants who arrived had to be explained that raping a woman was not okay, because they probably didn't know. There's a video, I think many of us have seen it, that is particularly funny and edifying if we then imagine that the same people who say it have to judge these types of crimes. The thing that actually left me particularly shocked was the list of results. At the end of all this beautiful project on sex, on consent, on ""transporting"" the issues and so on, it has results. What are the results for which 10,000 euros were given, money from the taxes of the people of the Aosta Valley? ""The project aims to combat patriarchal culture and gender violence by offering the population opportunities to meet and reflect on innovative issues - cutting-edge issues, we might say - such as sexuality and affectivity, bodies and gender stereotypes, deconstruction of patriarchal culture. In particular, among the expected outcomes of the project is the prevention and fight against gender violence - this is fine, but I would have stopped at violence - educating the young generations of formative age to recognize and fight patriarchal culture - therefore training - in which acts of gender violence are rooted in plural forms, not only violence by men against women - drum roll, I look at my colleagues - not only violence by men against women, but also homolesbotransbiphobia"". So we said it. We have been going around in circles throughout this project, gender violence here, patriarchy there, but we have also stuck a nice rainbow brushstroke at the end. In short, in light of all this, Councilor, I sincerely did not understand... among other things, I apologize, for the record, among the activities that are proposed there is also ""the organization of recreational evenings"". I do not know what ""recreational evenings"" are, but they are written in the project. Maybe I will ask for a specific explanation of what these ""recreational evenings"" are. With the presentation I gave you, I hope I have explained to you what our Region has unfortunately gone to finance and I ask you what the relevance of the project is to the purposes mentioned in the introduction and whether the Administration intends to make a better selection of projects so that they are relevant to the purposes of the law."
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,47,"For the answer, let's hear from Councilor Marzi."
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,2225,"Law no. 4/2013 on the prevention and fight against gender violence and support for women victims of gender violence recognizes that all forms of gender violence are a violation of human rights, physical and psychological integrity, freedom and dignity of the person and promotes initiatives to prevent and fight gender violence, including through public awareness and the dissemination of a culture of mutual respect between the sexes. In particular, Article 5 of the aforementioned law defines that the Region promotes projects aimed at implementing initiatives to prevent gender violence, particularly in schools and families, education on mutual respect in the relationship between the sexes, respect for sexual, religious and cultural identities, and non-violence as a method of civil coexistence and provides that anti-violence projects may include awareness and information campaigns on the issue of gender violence. With Resolution no. 401/2023 approved the call for proposals for the 2023 financial year for the financing of anti-violence projects for the prevention and information of gender-based violence, pursuant to Article 5 of the aforementioned Law No. 4/2013, and the specific theme on which the projects should focus and develop was shared within the Permanent Forum against harassment and gender-based violence. The evaluation of the projects, as provided for by paragraph 6 of Article 5 of No. 4/2013, is the responsibility of the Forum. The project in question was presented by the social promotion association Creature Montane APS and to the Forum itself. With reference to the expected results, it is also expected to raise awareness of a non-discriminatory and even less sexist culture of equality towards women. The project was examined by the commission provided for by the Forum which, in full legitimacy, positively evaluated the project in question, considering it consistent with the provisions of Resolution No. 401/2023 and in line with the theme defined within the Permanent Forum against harassment and gender-based violence."
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,49,"For the reply, the floor is given to Councilor Manfrin."
47959,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,6,4405,"I have taken note of the painful task of Councilor Marzi to defend the indefensible. I am close to you, Councilor, I realize the daunting task you are called to, every now and then you even manage to have a moment of pride, as you did yesterday, essentially not sharing what the Neuropsychiatry Service of our Region has done. I must tell you, however, for the next time, on some answers like these, if you manage to feign greater enthusiasm, probably the people who support these projects will be happier. I take note that your evaluations are linked to a mere list of rules, which evidently do not cover what is foreseen in these projects. The exaltation that, among other things, is in the project is beautiful, I repeat, it is not that there are many pages, it will be four/five, but with a lot of errors, so it means that perhaps they were more careful in receiving the funds than in writing the project. As always, then what is written is one thing, what is done I am very curious to know if it also follows the outline. The funny thing, in short, up to a certain point, is that, among other things, a show is exalted with a track, among other things, brought to the stage here in Valle d'Aosta, and not only, by a company from the Aosta Valley that is part of this let's call it ATI, because they are different associations even if they are not companies, but they receive the money and it is called: ""Having Bocca di Rosa as a mother"". This is the title of the show. The funny and recurring thing in this document is that it is always said that the image of women is sexualized and this is wrong, we can absolutely agree on this, but then the show is exalted, which is called: ""Having Bocca di Rosa as a mother"". I don't know, we all generally know Bocca di Rosa's profession, I don't know if this can have a congruence with what is outlined in the project. What remains, however, is that pages and pages are written, they try to confuse words with words, but in the end the line is clear. There is, as my colleague Perron rightly said before, a lobby, which is a very strong lobby, a lobby that is fueled by these actions, which have no intention of doing what they declare. What is done with these actions is simply self-feeding and political propaganda based on this self-feeding. We know very well that this project has no intention of developing results of that type, but, as they wrote, having evenings with tiktokers who present you with the petalous thing, who tell you ""girl power, we are all strong, we are all good"", but maybe next year you will come to the Gay Pride because that way we are many, we prevent homolesbobitransphobia, at least I think that's how it reads, which is obviously not in the law, so you know very well that this is absolutely not within, so much so that... my colleagues will agree, the action you want to do is to insert some traits of the PL n. 64, right in the law you mentioned, so evidently this part is not there but they want to force it in anyway. These results that are highlighted are not the results that we should have, we should have a structure that allows us to protect anyone who even just fears being subjected to violence, we should have a structure that teaches us not to use violence in any case, against anyone, because violence is never the explanation, instead we have hordes of people who feed themselves, who live off projects, who live off these things, they take on a job here today, tomorrow they will take on a small job from the Municipality of Aosta and they live off exactly this in function of the construction of the next project, the next cooperative, the next management. Then maybe it happens that these same people go to manage a public space and say that Fascists cannot enter there, maybe they even lay hands on them or call the police, who knows! I, Councilor, invite you, even though you have not found any inconsistencies, to think more carefully about the next time and to pay more attention to what is paid with our money, otherwise sooner or later, when the Government changes, perhaps these things, as has already been said, will find the taps closed."

47960,XVI,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,2,1533,"The month that has just ended, the month of October, is the month that has been recognized internationally for the promotion of awareness-raising and prevention activities for breast cancer and taking into account how an early and timely screening and prevention activity can guarantee the possibility of recovery in a very high percentage of cases relating to breast cancer, all this avoiding having to access healthcare, with less invasive treatments for women affected by this pathology. We have learned that, in the context of the awareness-raising activities that were carried out in the month of October, the Aosta Valley Section of the Italian League for the Fight against Cancer has launched an appeal with the request to introduce urgent and imperative measures to ensure that early intervention can be done in these situations that occur in the area. Basically, two proposals are made: the first is to lower the age, from 45 to 40 years, in relation to the screening that takes place on an annual basis; the second is at the same time to also start an awareness-raising within the school world to carry out an informative activity in the area regarding this topic. Therefore, with this interpellation we ask the Regional Government and in particular the competent Assessor if it intends to evaluate the reception of this appeal, or to introduce the two requests that have been put forward by the Aosta Valley Section of the League against Cancer."
47960,XVI,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councillor Marzi responds.
47960,XVI,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,2943,"Thank you, colleague Marquis. First of all, it should be noted that screening for the early diagnosis of breast cancer is usually aimed at women aged between 50 and 69 and is performed with a mammogram every two years. In some Regions, the effectiveness is being tested in a wider age group: between 45 and 74. This expansion of the target in Valle d'Aosta has already occurred since 2016. At a national level, the offer of screening to women aged between 40 and 44 is also being evaluated, but at the moment it does not appear that this age group has already been taken into consideration in a systematic manner by any Region. This expansion is therefore the subject of analysis and comparison in institutional tables, such as the National Screening Observatory and, consequently, we are also doing the same type of evaluation in our Region with respect to the further expansion of the offer of breast screening to this age group as well. At the moment, however, it is objectively a priority for the facilities that deal with screening activities to implement the percentage of adherence to the first level of mammographic screening. In this sense, we are working to develop targeted communication campaigns, a greater offer in the territory and a progressive digitalization of the procedures of the investigation path, which range from the call to the transmission of the result. The results published by the National Screening Observatory for 2023, although naturally limited, as I mentioned before, given that the age in the rest of Italy is 50-69 years, to this age group, therefore excluding from the calculation all the services administered to women aged between 45 and 49 and 70 and 74, show for the regional mammographic screening a percentage of adherence of 47.9% compared to a national figure of 55.4 and Northern Italy of 65.5. For this reason, at the moment we believe - and we are confident that you do too - that it is a priority and an urgent matter to raise awareness among women in the current extended and expected age group to adhere to the checks. In parallel, as mentioned, we will also work to evaluate the strengthening of the screening activity and therefore also to broaden the target audience, as requested. Perhaps, colleague Marquis, this initiative of yours will also help us to carry out prevention and promotion of the screenings that are recalled. Coming to question no. 2, prevention is done in more general terms with respect to the specific topic, premature with respect to the school age group. In fact, in this logic, a collaborative action is being carried out with the Superintendence of Studies, especially within the regional prevention plan, in order to propose secondary prevention messages to young people who should in turn be a vehicle of information and education towards adults."

47960,XVI,ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,6,2026,"Thank you Councilor for the response that was given to us. We have essentially advanced what was the request that was proposed by the Aosta Valley Section of the League against Cancer. We realize the difficulty in joining, which is a problem that must be addressed. On this occasion you spoke to us about procedures, digitalization, problems of convocation. In fact there is a whole organizational issue that has not found a solution for too long. We are a small Region and we should be a model in this respect, because it is easier to manage small numbers than large numbers when you have to design a management platform. Therefore we believe that it is correct to proceed with the dissemination and information campaign in schools, because this can be, in a context such as has been represented, an important element to create education towards attitudes that can be positive on the subject, which can then be reported by the world of school and by young people within the family to raise awareness on the issue. We believe that the evaluation is a positive thing to do and we hope that the words you said, where you say that this path will be evaluated, are a real evaluation, that it is done as quickly as possible, because even in Valle d'Aosta the number of people affected by this pathology at a younger age is growing. If you can intervene and find the problem in the initial phase, it is also much easier to be able to intervene in a positive way and with much higher percentages of success. Furthermore, prevention done with due attention is true that it leads to a more effective and more efficient organizational model from a certain point of view, but it is also true that, on the other hand, it then leads to savings in the management of subsequent health expenditure. We therefore trust that this topic will not be underestimated and will be treated with due attention."

47961,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,2,8073,"With this interpellation we return to the topic of the cost of district heating and we do so by taking the example of public residential buildings, because from there we can also have a term of comparison with other housing and between housing and costs before and after connection. Now, all this arises from a series of questions. We have highlighted over time, but we have always been answered by the person who was pro tempore Councilor for Social Policies, the then Councilor Barmasse, and also by you, Councilor Marzi, that in reality it was not true, that the costs of district heating were absolutely in line, indeed they were even lower than the cost of boilers, of the previous LPG. They were therefore all inventions. We then cited several articles for our benefit. An interesting journalistic analysis was done by ""Aostasera"" precisely on the cost of district heating, this for private condominiums, where it was highlighted that the cost of district heating was double or triple compared to the normal cost, let's call it that, of the previous heating system. Now we finally have a testimony from a public body that takes a stand on the issue, because on August 8, 2024 - and we're talking about August - a statement from the Municipality of Aosta comes out, which says: ""Palaindoor only partially used, but the costs of district heating double. The Municipal Council of Aosta has extended the management of the Palaindoor until December 31, 2024 to deal with the high costs of heating. The Municipality will contribute to the heating costs"". Finally, therefore, the fact is acknowledged, even by the public, that district heating is absolutely more expensive than other systems. In the body of the article that reports the part of the statements that the Municipality made, I think on the occasion of the City Council, it says that, to deal with the high costs of heating and the economic difficulties of managing the Palaindoor, the current management is extended until the end of the year and the Municipality ends up paying 50% of the bills, because otherwise the companies that manage it cannot cope. I think this position is clear and clarifies very well what the economic outlay that unfortunately district heating requires is. Let's instead come to another communication, even more clear, that I have already mentioned but I think it is appropriate to take up again and highlight again, where ARER has thought of communicating something important to users. We are grateful for once because we have finally put down in black and white also the critical issues related to district heating. ARER says in a communication sent to tenants: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in past seasons""... and it is strange, moreover, that we are talking about fuel, because you will know, Councilor, that so much has been done to spread the fairy tale of district heating powered by waste from Cogne, therefore a green source, indeed even that it reuses something that would be lost, instead here we realize as if by magic, in reality, district heating uses fuel. I repeat it, among other things, once and for all, once again, because, in my opinion, it helps to understand it: not only when the hot water leaves the plant and goes somewhere else to develop its effects, it clearly loses heat on its way, it loses approximately one or two degrees for every kilometer traveled and the district heating network is 50 kilometers long in the city of Aosta. I'll let you do the calculations. Not only is fuel used to produce that heating source, but then there are revamping plants specifically to avoid the effect of the loss of temperature, which use additional fuel to always heat that water that had started from the other side and was already hot. All this obviously produces costs, multiplied costs. ARER then tells us: ""Given the considerable increases in the cost of fuel in past seasons and considering the probable continuation of such costs at least for the 2024-2025 season? And here's a twist? Together with the possible limitation of available fuel"". I have said this before at the DEFR, but I will say it again: do we expect a war? Is there a fuel constraint? Are the world's oil reserves exhausted? Are the gas reserves exhausted?Cogne will no longer work? We don't know, that is, explain to us what is happening. Why will there be a limitation of the available fuel? What is happening? Why does ARER write to tenants that they might run out of fuel? It really seems like being below deck on a ship and the cabin boy says: ""Captain, look, we're running out of coal here, we have to slow down"". I put myself in the shoes of a tenant who reads something like that. ""In light of all this - also the limitation of fuel - careful and scrupulous use of heating for sanitary water is recommended"". Limit consumption, wash once a week, don't heat too much, because here you have to limit it. ""Both to avoid an excessive increase in individual expenses, and to reduce fuel consumption"" which, as was said before, could become scarce, or even go to zero and here we freeze to death. Then Councilor will remember a discussion on boilers, the famous boilers, we also talked about it with colleague Baccega, he told us that the boiler system is wrong, it is dangerous, it had to be changed, that it cannot be used. ""Buh! How disgusting boilers!"". Where one opened and closed and knew what he was consuming, if I open I consume and I know how much I consume, I am doing it myself. Better district heating, which has monstrous costs, but above all a part of undivided consumption, and this is not said. There is a part of consumption that does not depend only on what I use, but a part of consumption of the condominium, which I would not have paid with my boiler, however this communication tells us: ""Only for tenants who use autonomous heating systems, boilers or alternative forms (stoves) we remind you that before the start of the winter season tenants are required to carry out periodic inspections of the systems used and cleaning of the flues by specialized personnel"". We find at the bottom of this communication the solution to the danger of boilers: commit the tenants to do maintenance. A solution that we could define as Columbus' egg. In the face of all this, however, we already have the first effects. I have two bills from last season and the current season. Last season the same user had an estimate of consumption use for the 2023-2024 season of 450 euros, so in one season he was made aware of the fact that the estimate was 450 euros and that he would have consumed that amount. The same accommodation is forcibly connected, with the men at the door who throw you out if you don't connect, to the district heating and this year the estimate arrives, which goes from 450 euros in 2023-2024 to 1,750 euros in 2024-2025. An increase that is plastic, is in the cards and is due to the mandatory connection of district heating for all accommodations. This is why, in light of this, Councillor, although it is almost certain that we will not get any answers, other than a strenuous defence of what has already been put in place by ARER, we ask you: whether a comparison has been made between the costs incurred before the connection to district heating and those incurred afterward; if so, what is the outcome of the comparison; if not, whether you intend to do so and, if the cost is higher than the previous one, identify the appropriate methods of support for families in need; what are the reasons for the announced and considerable increases in the cost of fuel and also what is meant by ""limitation of available fuel""."
47961,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councilor Marzi responds.
47961,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,7018,"In the communication note to users sent by ARER to tenants, emphasis is placed on the careful and scrupulous use of heating and domestic hot water precisely to be of help in limiting their use and, therefore, to also have adequate attention to expenses. Precisely because ARER, as recalled by its presentation and also by its initiative, in reality does not only carry out the role of condominium administrator, but also of a subject involved in the management of socio-housing hardship. Normally a landlord, a condominium administrator, whether renting or owning, does not send this type of communication to tenants: this is true precisely because ARER in reality also carries out that type of service. English: The Department also requested data comparing the costs incurred before the connection to district heating and those incurred afterward and there is no increased cost for users connected to district heating compared to previous or alternative supplies, neither in the 2021-2022 season, nor in the 2022-2023 season, nor even in the 2023-2024 season. For the maximum protection of its tenants, a contract was signed with the Telcha company, which guarantees the maintenance over time of the agreed economic convenience, equal to 16.64%, compared to other alternative sources available on the market, with particular reference to the price of gas in relation to the overall cost. Therefore, regardless of the private dynamics that may exist between a public structure, managed by a subject, and the district heating company, which you mentioned in the presentation of the initiative, this does not concern the dedicated relationships that both I and my colleague Barmasse have repeatedly recalled, which exist between ARER and Telcha. Not because it is not the public's duty to reason about who supplies district heating, but that does not pertain to the initiative because the relationships that bind ARER to Telcha are relationships that must be maintained within certain cost parameters, naturally in favor of those who live in the housing emergency or in the reference public housing. The consumption estimates for the 2024-2025 season are drawn up on the basis of the final accounts of the 2023-2024 season and generally report an average decrease in costs of about 14% of all ARER buildings connected to district heating. The only increase forecasts concern the buildings called Filippini and Stura, in the Cogne district, whose connection will be starting from the 2024-2025 season: therefore, inevitably, it has increased for the simple fact that previously heating was not included in the estimate. As already mentioned, unit costs are guaranteed to be as competitive as possible, but the overall cost of heating also depends, obviously, on the tenants' consumption. In this specific case, it is also useful to report the data that I now represent. The expenditure for buildings connected to district heating is reported below, with a comparison of the last three heating seasons. After the anomalous increase in the 2021-2022 season, there was a significant reduction in costs already in the following season and there is a further reduction for the season just ended. In fact, to date, compared to a 2021-2022 season of 1,071,499 euros, last year in the 2022-2023 season there was already a drop of 20.29% on average, therefore going down to 854,000 euros. At this time there has been a further drop of 14%, as mentioned earlier, which brings the total costs of connected condominiums to 734,000 euros. As regards the whole issue of water and water management, that too is part of a dynamic between a subject appointed to participate in the system of socio-housing hardship and its tenants, because in fact in the management of public spaces, therefore also of public housing, there are parameters and objectives that are given to those who manage public spaces that are also linked to the use of water and energy efficiency. It is important, colleague Manfrin, with respect to history and the countless initiatives that will continue to exist, where in fact you and I do not have to discuss, but rather discuss, about what colleague Lucianaz was referring to yesterday afternoon with respect to a direct line, in reality the direct line exists on the issues. You naturallyEnglish: currently brings forward certain types of requests and we try to represent the complexity of such a large management. However, I have already told you once and I will repeat it: the story of the difficulties in terms of costs with respect to the tools used to heat the public housing in the Cogne district, in particular, is a story older than me and you. It is a story that in history has seen, over the last twenty-five years, ""n"" thousand minority Councilors, ""n"" thousand Administrators, who have tried to represent, whatever the choice made to heat the houses in the Cogne district, by those who collect the just requests of the residents of the protests because they were too expensive and, in fact, find solutions. Every time the solutions that were proposed were found, the next tool that was criticized as too expensive for the management of the public housing was the one that was first longed for. Here is my colleague Baccega who will remember the ""n"" thousand discussions in the City Council with the then Deputy Mayor regarding the issue of boilers and heating devices in the same council houses we are talking about today. At that time, boilers and all sorts of other types of heating devices were longed for to be replaced, with all the delays involved, by district heating. Then people started to protest because district heating was not being connected as quickly as possible. Even today, you only have to go on the Internet and you will find endless discussions between the then Deputy Mayor and a colleague, who we all know. Today we are at the same point regarding district heating, even if district heating, among other things, in some cases has also been brought up by some minority colleagues, represents from this point of view, not because it is the best solution, but because of the specific relationships that exist between the company that supplies it and ARER, which are expressly dedicated to ARER, a less expensive tool than other forms of heating on the market today. I know you won't be happy with this. I believe that fuel is in fact another of the tools for which ARER wants to communicate... in my humble opinion, that part on the old communication is a typo, but I will let you know. In my opinion, it is still a typo in the old peer communication that was sent last year. I will, however, let you have the reference."

47961,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia, EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,6,4661,"Thank you Councilor for your answer which, as you predicted, evidently does not see us in agreement, but it is not that you do not see us in agreement because of a question of bias. I thank you for the answers you wanted to provide and obviously I also imagine what is the painful task that falls to you every time. I believe that there is an underlying reasoning. What is the point? The point is that today we are dealing, in particular with public residential construction, but it is not only this, because, as I have highlighted several times, the problem of costs concerns and unfortunately also involves private condominiums. I have had experiences of people who connected their condominium and evidently a minute later regretted it when the first bills arrived, but this is a private experience. Having said that, what is the issue? The principle is this, Councilor. I understand, and you are perfectly right, often politics seeks a quibble, something to be able to discuss and above all to agree with the interlocutor who comes raising a problem. But, as I told you, I actually have the comparison between before and after, but I don't think that's the choice, the problem and the issue either. I believe that the problem, the issue on which this question of costs has not been digested, was the imposition. The imposition generates a dispute. If people had been put in the position of choosing whether to connect to district heating or keep the old heating system, I believe that all of this would have been digested better. I'll tell you more, Councilor: the people who were threatened - I have brought this up several times in this Council - that if they did not allow the workers to enter the housing they would be thrown out of their homes, have made an extra move. Because they were rightly told: well, this is considered an improvement to the housing, so you are obliged to let the workers in. Fine, let's let them in. But I'm keeping my old system. I'll make you do all the connections you want, I'll keep my old system, which I'll have the appropriate checks done and I'll use that one, that wasn't allowed either. ARER stubbornly said: ""woe betide you, we're seeing that you're not consuming with district heating, woe betide you. Close it down, remove your system immediately"". This is not a motivation of costs or no costs, this really seems like a vindictive issue: ""Oh yeah, you won't let me do what I want? Oh yeah, you won't let me? You won't use the system I gave you? Then I'll beat you"". This is profoundly wrong. After that, it's a question of costs. You say it's not a more expensive system. Let's assume I believe you and you're acting in good faith, rightly so. I don't know if you've had a comparison or if you've actually had the bills, because I wouldn't trust the tables they give me, an Excel table made by a surveyor who tells me: the cost before was like this and then the cost was this. This is manipulation, in the sense that one person manipulates one cost and another. I would ask: excuse me, can you give me the history of a bill for that accommodation from 2021 and 2024? It is something grave, if there is an increase, it is clear that I will detect an increase, I will read it. Since, I repeat, I do not know if you have this, but I think they have made you a summary table, you should trust it. You do not want to trust what I tell you and what I show you, at least trust the statements of the Municipality of Aosta. It is the Municipality of Aosta itself that says: ""The Palaindoor is only partially used, but the costs of district heating are doubling"". The Municipality of Aosta says it, not me. How come the Municipality of Aosta detects a doubling of the cost of heating and the ARER does not? Do they use two different district heating systems? No, because we are in a monopoly regime, there is one monopolist, he provides everything. So, you understand, there is a discrepancy on this: either they increase for everyone or they do not increase for anyone. You say that there are preferential prices with regard to ARER: I take note of this, but in reality the bills say something completely different. You may eventually and rightly modify and justify what you deem most appropriate, but this is not a political quibble, unfortunately this is a fact. I hope that you can pay due attention to what you haveI said and I hope that somehow, sooner or later, we can get to the point of giving people the freedom to warm themselves up however the hell they want."

This emerges from a report released ten days ago and presented in Rome. The data refers to 2023. Eye exams scheduled for 120 days, which move four times as much, almost 500 days; the same for eco-Doppler, class B eye exams, hip replacements, etc. 7.6 of citizens have given up treatment, almost 1% more than in 2022 and almost 2 out of 3, 4.5%, do so precisely because of the long waiting lists. The rate of giving up among women is higher than among men. I presented this initiative some time ago, Councilor, because the citizens of the Aosta Valley, as you can well imagine, as is often and willingly heard in this chamber, rightly ask for information and clarifications. English: What is the situation in Valle d'Aosta? According to an Agenas survey on the ratio between visits provided in ordinary form and those in intramoenia, during 2022, which seems to be the latest data available, the Valle d'Aosta Region has once again recorded one of the indicators that is defined as the most critical in Italy: compared to 87% of ordinary visits, in intramoenia it reaches 12.25%. Specialist visits in intramural mode, therefore outside the normal working hours of doctors, have a waiting time that is decidedly lower than the ordinary one. Here, I imagine, because it is preferred by the Val d'Aosta people, practical people, who when they have an emergency, a need, see to dealing with it as soon as they can. Of course, this is not for everyone's budget and in fact it is not so easy for everyone to be able to access this service. Fortunately, however, that the situation in Valle d'Aosta of the waiting lists is less serious than elsewhere, can certainly also contribute to this fact. I won't go on any further, also because in the inspection act I filled you with popular rhetoric, where you certainly excel compared to me, so I won't go any further. The initiative was to provide the public opinion of the Aosta Valley with some data and the terms of the question of how much the intramural profession affects, precisely, the Aosta Valley health system."

47962,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L., Personale medico e paramedico",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,7716,"English: In order to immediately excel in the art of dialectics, the first thing that comes to mind for you regarding initiative no. 80 is to reach an agreement with your new group colleague, colleague Restano, regarding the LPA, because he maintains that the LPA should be given in a more extensive manner and you, in no. 80, maintain that the LPA should be numbered differently. Now we will try to explain some aspects. The phenomenon of waiting lists, as we have already had the opportunity to share on several occasions, is the main health problem perceived not only by our community, but by the entire population on the national territory. It is a topic that, as is known, is continually brought to the attention of the media, even if most of the time the information provided is aimed more at making noise than at giving correct indications and solutions to citizens. With this I am obviously not talking about you, colleague Lucianaz, but I am talking about those who use this tool to distract. We reiterate once again how the problem is essentially linked to the lack of doctors and therefore to the difference between supply and demand for services. Therefore, it is clear that, beyond the specific issue you mentioned in the initiative, this widespread problem will exist until truly useful paths to finding these figures are identified at a national level, also with a significant review of the sector contracts. For years, the concrete commitment undertaken together with the USL Company has been aimed at announcing numerous competitions, creating agreements and pursuing collaborations with other regional entities. In this sense, the data that the USL Company communicates regarding participation in competitions have been the subject of discussion in the chamber several times. Precisely because the phenomenon is dated in the years and heavily involves the entire national territory, the Government in office, at the gates of last summer, issued a specific decree-law, which we have already discussed in the chamber on several occasions, the last time in July 2024, effectively recognizing its structural dimension within the national health service. To implement the various regulations on the subject, we were forced, with resolution of the Regional Council no. 1185 of 30 September 2024, to approve the establishment of the Central Unit for the management of healthcare and waiting times and lists, composed of healthcare and administrative professionals. We are therefore following all the requirements set out in the national law on the matter, as well as the activation of the national waiting list platform and lastly the appointment of the Sole Responsible for Regional Healthcare which took place at the end of last October. Pending this activation, Agenas, which you mentioned, will activate a new data flow relating to specialist services starting from 1 January 2025 which will replace the current one. Furthermore, the USL Company has already revised the discipline of the protection pathways which provides that the patients who are unable to be provided with visits within the prescribed times are offered alternative solutions by the Company itself, mediating additional activities organized by the Company, or through the appeal always with the sole payment of the ticket of the accredited private individual. Let us now respond to the specific points of your initiative. Point 1: ""how many local health care doctors work in the intramoenia regime and where do they work?"" Intramoenia is called LPI. The doctors of the USL Company who carry out intramoenia private practice - and therefore outpatient and surgical - are 158 out of a total of 297, practically only half. They carry out this activity at the various company facilities, therefore the Umberto Parini hospital, the Beauregard and the facilities on via Guido Rey n. 3, the so-called ""outpatient clinics"". We also remember that the facility where, in fact, intramoenia activity was centralized was one of the various things required in the various regulations that have chased each other over the decades for the management of waiting lists that required that intramoenia activities be all centralized in one place. The autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta was perhaps the only or one of the very few regions in Italy to try to manage waiting lists in one of the various decrees that have followed one another over the last twenty-five years.for the management of the topic. Let's come to question no. 2 ""how many visits in the private practice regime were carried out in 2023 and divided by specialist visit or other visits"". As regards the number of services carried out during the year 2023, given the impossibility of listing in detail the significant amount of data, the project of the services that find their source in the Agenas monitoring is made available via email, which you will surely already have and, if you do not have it, we will provide it to you, because it is a public table on which, regarding this latest regulatory variant, this file also arrives. Among other things, in this table we are in the average of the non-solution of the problem and only in four cases a little worse. ""How many institutional hours has each individual doctor adhering to intramoenia performed and how many have they performed as a freelancer"": the evaluation of the relationships between institutional activity, therefore ordinary activity, and intramoenia freelance activity, which the latest national regulations on waiting lists have brought to the attention, has always been monitored by the USL Company. The comparison is made between volumes of services provided per team. We therefore confirm that the relationship is maintained, as can be seen from the data provided. Institutional activity is always higher than intramoenia activity because on this point it is useful to specify that the institutional employment relationship provides for 38 hours per week, while freelance activity does not exceed 10 hours per week on average. ""What actions does the competent Councillor intend to adopt in agreement with the Health Authority with respect to the last aspects"": as we have already highlighted, the USL Company has always guaranteed over the years compliance with the relationship between institutional activities and intramoenia activities. There are several actions aimed at incentivizing staff to perform activities in the institutional sphere, including through paid work in company freelance work, which is the LPA, referred to in initiative no. 73 by colleague Restano. The bone of contention, in my humble opinion - and with this there is absolutely no will to dislike initiative no. 80 - is linked to the fact - and we will also have the opportunity with respect to no. 81 to intervene on the merits - of taking into consideration what are currently the three main problems that Italian public health has: the first is the number of professionals, of any characteristic, therefore both medical professionals and the other 26 health professionals; the second is the financing of the public health service; the third is the waiting lists. Of these three gigantic problems, waiting lists are naturally the most hated by the population, as I already had the opportunity to declare in July, but I am not the only one doing so, otherwise the national government, which has just transformed a decree into law, would not now be re-editing another decree to manage the issue. The problem of waiting lists is a separate problem for the Italian public health service, including the regional one. It is the one most hated by everyone and, unfortunately, the one with the least solution of all."

I had asked you some more specific questions, well, we'll see what we can get out of this file. What the man in the street, like me, is wondering? Without being Bocca di Rosa, but am I in the street too?, is that perhaps the monopoly regime is bad for a company, because, if the problem is pandemic and has been dragging on for years or decades, probably not the subordinates, but someone at the top must face some organizational problems. I recently heard a head doctor complain about spending more time doing administration than his job as a doctor. Probably these structures have too high an administrative load, we have more officials in the offices than in the corridors... I don't know, but certainly thanks to those who, it's strange to say, operate under the intramoenia regime, which, if nothing else, lightens the load. It seems like a paradox, but thanks to these the lists are certainly lightened. With good will, more can certainly be done. I start with the environmental conditions of this hospital, which are certainly not optimal, but to some it seems that things are fine this way and will continue to be this way for decades to come. I repeat, however, that a company should also find all the strength and energy possible within itself and I would say that they are welcome, that they renew, that they definitely make this machine more efficient. Good work to those at the top of the structure then."

47963,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,2,3012,"English: We have received the 2024 Civic Health Report from Cittadinanzattiva, which this year also wanted to somehow analyze the framework of enforceability of the founding elements of the national health service, with the idea of ​​highlighting critical issues and strengths of the system itself in its regional articulation. The picture of our Region appears to be unedifying compared to this report, but, as is often represented to us in this chamber, those data do not represent reality or at least this is what we are told. In some way, therefore, we would like to understand from the Councilor and we have highlighted some salient issues. First of all, the report highlights that the Aosta Valley has suffered a percentage drop of 27% in total services provided in 2023 compared to 2019, resulting in the second worst data in Italy. It underlines how this reflects a worsening of access and efficiency of the health service. Then there is a worsening of waiting times, a topic already discussed in a previous interpellation. The report highlights a particularly significant increase in waiting times for the oncology area, with a worsening of 17.74% between 2019 and 2022. This is also a particularly critical figure for what concerns urgent and delicate treatments, even if the company has already responded to this in some way, but the Councilor will say so. There is then a focus on the use of intramural freelance professional activity, which we talked about a little while ago. Valle d'Aosta is the second region with a higher percentage of hospitalization services provided in freelance compared to institutional ones: 0.5%, equal to 83 services out of 18,000. This could indicate, but we ask the Councilor, a more frequent use of paid services to make up for deficiencies in public health. There is also a difference between prescribed and provided services. Valle d'Aosta also has the highest percentage: 28% discrepancy between prescribed and actually provided services, another sign of the system's difficulty in ensuring all prescribed treatments. This report, compared also with what has been reported and with what has been done by IRES in the analysis that SPI Cgil gave us, highlights here too those critical issues that we have in some way spoken about at length. We also believe that both Cittadinanzattiva and SPI Cgil have in some way a certain capillarity in our territory and that in some way the fact that these problems are reported I believe is done first of all to try to have answers and above all to somehow encourage improvements. In light of all this, we ask the Councilor if the aforementioned analyses, therefore especially those of the Cittadinanzattiva report, correspond to reality and what actions have been implemented or are intended to be proposed to improve the health system."
47963,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,30,The floor goes to Councilor Marzi.
47963,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,10158,"I will answer both questions together. First of all, it is important to understand two issues. The first is that the civic health report by Cittadinanzattiva always carries out the analysis on the same data relating to 2022 and in some cases on the data relating to the first half of 2023. This is a normal delay in national reports, but it must be taken into account. It is also important to point out that very often these reports are all drawn up starting from the same sources, such as, for example, the evaluation of the LEA or the new guarantee system. Every time a report is published, a new initiative is presented, but each time it is presented as if it were new data or updated data, but the data on the essential levels of assistance relating to 2022 are always the same. So for the umpteenth time we analyze and explain them. We thank you, therefore, for giving us the opportunity to once again tell of the great commitment and all the attention that both the Department and the USL Company are investing to improve and strengthen both the quality of the data and information that are disclosed, and the services provided. I think that the 2022 data will be at least the sixth or seventh time that we have analyzed them in the classroom. Fortunately, in the meantime they are improving. As I anticipated, I confirm that we have already had extensive opportunity to comment on the data reported to attention and these have certainly been an important starting point for reflection to start improvement actions. Today we can therefore update the situation and report a value closer to us than the information published and referred to 2022, or to the beginning of 2023. Coming to the second issue that we want to bring to attention, also this one already illustrated several times in this classroom, concerns the topic, for years never taken into consideration, of how faithfully we describe the healthcare activity that we provide. It is called data quality and it concerns both the completeness of the information entered in the information flow and the correctness and congruence of the data in terms of exact rules and codes. This, for example, since I mentioned earlier that this is the umpteenth time that we have dealt with the topic, was the subject of an initiative by colleague Aggravi. On this last point you already know that we have been investing for some time, both through the establishment of the Information Flow Office at the Department, from 2023, and through a specific working group provided for by the health and social welfare plan and the subject of specific action also in the Annual Operational Program, i.e. the POA 2024, of the health and social welfare plan at sheet no. 20, approved with resolution no. 622/2024. The working group is addressing the qualitative issue of the flow, as well as the performance of healthcare, identifying the areas to be strengthened and proposing action to contrast it with the collaboration of the reference clinicians. Coming specifically to the questions you raised, reported in the premises of the interpellation, compared to the 23% drop, the drop, as you certainly know, was attributable to the difficulty in finding the necessary professions. Here we come to initiative no. 80 of colleague Lucianaz just now. The lack of specialist doctors, technicians and nurses affects above all outpatient services as the available human resources are obviously oriented primarily towards emergencies, then to guarantee coverage in the hospitalization departments and subsequently, with the residual resources, obviously respecting the work shifts imposed by the USL, on outpatient services. However, the increase in hiring has already made it possible to recover part of the services considered and in fact the same data for the first half of 2023, compared with 2022, recorded a +4.1%, which rises to a +7.5% if all specialist services are considered. This despite the fact that the new hires were intended to naturally and primarily recover the volumes for hospitalization activities. Specifically, the surgical activity, in 2023, exceeded that of 2019 by more than 25% and in the first months of 2024 it recorded a further +11%. Coming to the other question, on the highest worsening of waiting times, in addition to referring to data from two years ago, we inform you that the Complex Oncology and Oncological Hematology Structure of the Parini Hospital in Aosta has recorded2023 saw a 22% increase in services and the trend is also confirmed by partial data for this year. The Reception and Services Center (CAS) also guarantees patients rapid access to care and first visits are guaranteed within five working days. After a decline in activity in 2020 and 2021, obviously coinciding with the pandemic, oncology activity has started to grow again since 2022, recording 861 hospitalizations with 11,456 days of decency in 2023. The trend is confirmed again this year, the numbers for the first half of 2024 are in line with those of 2023. ""The second Region with the highest percentage of private hospitalizations"". As is known, small numbers have a high variability. In fact, over the years, especially the last ones, the value has fluctuated between 02 and 05. However, Agenas constantly monitors the private institutional relationship and the data collected on regional volumes of activity and freelance professions. In relation to institutional activity, they have always demonstrated full respect in Valle d'Aosta for the ratios between the volumes of the two types of activity. Coming to the higher percentage of services actually provided compared to those planned, what was reported in response to the first question is partly valid, and the considerations that are mandatory in terms of appropriateness of the services are partly valid. The number of services per inhabitant is higher than the average, an indicator of the existence of margins for recovery of appropriateness of prescriptions, on which we are working. Coming to the last question, that is, the discrepancy between high health expenditure and the goals achieved in terms of coverage of demand, you, colleague Guichardaz, the first thing you must consider is that it is never, if it were not so, the thing that everyone would be telling us is that we do not put enough resources into public health. Let's instead come to the object of analysis of this data. First of all, I mentioned it earlier in response to colleague Lucianaz to question no. 80, the problems of the public health service in Italy today are always the same three mentioned above. Let's clear the waiting lists, because I clearly said the above and it's not the first time I've said it. Let's instead stick to two dramatic issues, but on which we can try to do something: the first is the number of professionals at 360 degrees, from doctors to all the expected health professionals, and the second is the financing of the public health service which at this moment in Italy is the object of a very close comparison between the central State and all the Regions, I won't explain why. In Valle d'Aosta this problem, with extreme sacrifices by everyone, does not exist and will not exist for the next few years, because the reference data on which we have tried to stabilize health expenditure in the next few years with respect to the financial coverage of the LEA, you will see it in the next budget forecast, will certainly be the subject of a more in-depth discussion in the chamber. However, it is important to say that what we have tried to do with the next budget forecast on health expenditure is the coverage and stabilization over the entire three-year period of the same figure with regard to the essential levels of assistance. In the current forecast, the 2024-2025-2026 one, the reference expenditure for the coverage of the essential levels of assistance in 2024 was 277 million, then 270 million in 2025 and 266 million in 2026. Even just this discrepancy between the first year of the old budget forecast compared to the second year, always of the old budget forecast, created problems, for example, for the Aosta Valley Health Authority for the preparation of its own budget forecast. Naturally in 2024 you have to make the budget forecast for 2025, in 2023 you had to do it for 2024 and so we can move forward. Having figures for the second year of the three-year period lower than those of the current year, there were always problems, so often we went in derogation with the budget forecast not allowing the Aosta Valley Health Authority to have its own budget approved on January 1st of the following year. With the stabilization that we are making of the essential levels of assistance over the entire three-year period, even increasing to 278 million euros, we are in fact guaranteeinga stabilization of health coverage, so the first thing we all have to say is that with everyone's sacrifice, with everyone's analysis, because these things here, I can assure you, I say them here but it's not that they give particular merit, in fact maybe tomorrow I find letters that tell me ""but if you put the money in, because I can't make the visit in a day, two days, three days"" and so on. I say this to everyone because that is the object of contention and they ask me continuously. Since we have the job of being the Administrator, therefore of making choices also planning and strategic, with respect to the last question of your initiative, it is absolutely important to represent this. Naturally, all of this is also connected to the guarantee of spending on Title II on investments. I think we are one of the few local health companies to guarantee a €6,650,000 funding every year, so this, regardless of what might seem to be discrepancies between how much we invest and how much we get back, is actually a positive thing for our health system."

47963,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Piano socio-sanitario regionale",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,6,3164,"Councillor, every time you say ""it's the same data"". Of course, it's the same data, but new ones are always added: for example, the services actually provided compared to those prescribed, I hadn't seen them in the Agenas report. This is an example. On this too, Councillor, you know very well because we were also in the majority together and we discussed it extensively, but one of the priorities that our political force put forward was the issue of the Observatory, but not because of our own punctiliousness, because every time we clash with those data and evidently, if none of us understand them, because today it's my initiative, that of Councillor Lucianaz, and so on, but in every Council it's like this, evidently there is a problem, Councillor, that you must start dealing with. Above all - I say this in every forum and in every place - we certainly cannot say that there is no money and it is also written in the premises of my interpellation, because in fact we cannot say that no money is being put into the budget. But allow me - we will come back to the next initiative of J.B. Festaz, which is perhaps even easier to understand since it is a small reality -, if we go from 2 to 5 million and if the quality of the service worsens and people leave, can we ask ourselves a question? Can we ask ourselves why, by increasing resources so much, we end up arriving at these conclusions? Evidently the results are not visible and, from this point of view, even on the waiting lists, allow me, those floating lists give hives to all those who call the CUP and tell them: ""you are placed in floating"", which means: wait, hope and you will never have the possibility of being examined. This is what people perceive. After that for you it is a sensible thing, continue to do it, but this is not how you give effective answers to people. Look, Councilor, I made a mistake, I did not send you the video I told you about yesterday, but I am sending it to you. If you tell a person who is waiting for a hernia operation when it is a high priority: ""you have to wait a year"" and then, calling a private clinic, you tell them: ""it's 6,000 euros but we can come to an agreement, maybe it's 3,000"", there is a problem here. After that, maybe you will tell me that it is a fake interview and this, in my opinion, should be reported, because, if these things come out in the newspapers and on national broadcasts, on the one hand there is still a return of image on the Aosta Valley that is not positive. I tell you this because, unfortunately, in my life I have also had people with serious disabilities next to me and even just when choosing where to go on holiday the first thing we looked at was whether it was close to a hospital and what the health system was like in that region. Those were the first choices we made to identify the region to go on holiday. I tell you, Councilor, in my opinion, take these initiatives as initiatives that want to help in some way and certainly not always crucify the Aosta Valley health system, which we know very well makes enormous efforts."
47964,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,103,"Interpellation no. 82 of the agenda. Councilor Restano has asked to speak, he has the floor."
47964,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Restano,Claudio,1964,M,RV,2,3379,"Let's talk about the family nanny service. We have learned of a note that freelance family nannies have sent to the Regional Administration, to the offices of the Regional Administration, essentially. The nannies are asking for an increase in the nannies-users ratio, which is currently one to four. They arrive at this request after a series of evaluations and comparisons with other situations. I tell you that in the Province of Trento five children are authorized, therefore one more user; in Veneto nannies are authorized to assist six children; in Valle d'Aosta four are authorized and, where there is a nanny's child over 3 years old, the fourth child is also allowed, but the service must be managed by the mother... the fifth child. Obviously it has always been a service of excellence for us, a service also developed on the territory, which has allowed the people of the Aosta Valley to live in the mountains and to have those who provided a service provided, with great professionalism, organizational skills, people with a strong sense of responsibility, whose goal was the well-being of the children. Other services similar to this one have the same objectives and perform the service in the same way. It must be said, however, that, for example, the nursery service has a user-educator or nanny ratio of one to eight, therefore significantly higher. You understand that the balance at the end of the month is completely different. Why did the nannies come to this request? Obviously because there have been a series of changes over time, for example, the early entry of small users into nursery school, therefore brought forward by months, means that small users who use the nanny service leave the service at the end of the year and the nanny goes from four users to three. If perhaps at the same time one of these children is only hired part-time, the nanny has a further hole, therefore you understand that the income is always lower. Being able to increase, at least as they underline, by one unit, if not by two, would allow the financial accounts within the service offered to be rebalanced. I believe that a further request is coming or has already arrived from the nannies, always to the offices of the Region, who ask for an adjustment of the fee that the parents of these children must pay to the family nanny service, to bring it closer to the fee that is paid for the nursery service. Obviously on one hand, with the same ISEE, a fee of 272 euros is paid and on the other 487 euros, so there is a substantial difference, beyond what is given by the Region. There is also a further request, which is the one regarding the recognition of the meal voucher, which is 1 euro. You understand, they use local products, the snack is free, the meal is given for only 1 euro, it seems a little too little for all this, to be able to continue to provide a service of this type. Unless the political choice is completely different, let's all go to work in the nursery and, since someone says it will be free, let's provide the free nursery service. However, it is a political choice that must be expressed. What is essentially being asked, Councillor, in the end, is whether you want to make an assessment and meet these requests, or whether you intend to take a different path."
47964,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Famiglia, tutela dell'infanzia",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councilor Marzi responds.

To save time for everyone, therefore I believe that you will be absolutely satisfied with the interpellation and also with the sources that have represented you more than the relevant Councilor knows."

47965,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,2,4873,"This morning, colleagues Aggravi and Manfrin addressed the issue of the proclamation of a state of agitation with respect to the J.B. Festaz, here we are going to take a step further than the requests they brought and that is why, by mutual agreement, we had decided not to include this interpellation. As for the issue of the expansion of the Parini Hospital, I believe that the position of our regional group with respect to the issue of the J.B. Festaz is known, that is, we said we were against moving the RSA and the UAP to Variney because we were convinced that that move would have led to a worsening of the service, which then occurred, so much so that we even had to set up a commission to verify the state of the art and then because there was also an outsourcing, but on the other hand because we thought it was wrong for people with a certain amount of experience to go and occupy places in the Hospital and then be reabsorbed into the Community Hospital. Somehow, during the many questions that followed in those months of July and August of 2023, we had started to say that it seemed a bit like a shell game, where at a certain point I move the RSA to Variney and outsource, I move whoever was in the RSA to the Hospital, at this point the Community Hospital is freed up and then who knows whether either the Community Hospital or in some way the hospital department will also end up outsourcing them. This was a bit of the picture we had during that period, so we had insisted, for example, on inter-compartmental mobility, because we knew that it had already been used, as you also confirmed in several of our questions, we knew that there was the possibility, therefore, if in some way we decide to send people to the hospital, in the meantime, in our opinion, it should have been asked of all those in the nursing home, and not just a part, but even there we had been told that there was a group, this group wanted to go all together and this group wanted to return all together. This is a bit of a summary of what happened. In the meantime, the work on the community hospital has begun, in some way it is also proceeding, there has also been the addition of the water columns, as you mentioned today during the morning, so in some way we have moved forward from that point of view. Now we are almost getting to the point, because I seem to remember that in any case you said that the Community Hospital would open in 2025 and 2025 is upon us, in any case there is also a time frame in which the movement of people who are in the Hospital... must be welcomed back into the Community Hospital. With this interpellation as a first point we ask for the state of the art with respect to the opening times of the new Community Hospital and also therefore the coincidence of the end of the duration of the temporary assignment of staff, or when we intend to open the Hospital and when this staff returns to the structure of the J.B. Festaz. In the meantime however we have analyzed the various resolutions that are coming out over time and we have noticed that calls are being made - you had also mentioned it to us - for OSS or nursing staff, but in some of the premises we found something a little strange, that is, that people on the list, with reached the limits of 36 months of work, are not considered. Even though we know there are vacancies, we are moving forward, or even going to a temporary agency. The other question is therefore whether it is true that operators with 36 months at J.B. Festaz have not been hired. Already this morning, Councilor Manfrin asked about the issue of staffing, the fact that we also saw that there was a position in the concierge service and that this was not filled by staff with limitations. You have already given an answer today, so it is up to you to repeat it or avoid it. What I am certainly saying is that, in the event that there were to be a mobility, at this point what you told me last time would completely fall, that is, that those staff could not be recovered within the facility, because we can very well move them to the hospital. There are many places available, so just as we can calmly move the staff without limitations, we can very well move the staff with limitations too.tations. Then we ask you about the developments regarding the state of agitation. Today you already told us that there seems to have been no agreement, but we wanted to understand better, also because you said that he had been summoned and then did not show up, I think that's what I understood. We would therefore like to understand this part better regarding the state of agitation called by the unions."
47965,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,27,Councilor Marzi responds.
47965,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,9357,"In the first instance, Mr Guichardaz, as I also said to Mr Restano a moment ago, the presentation of your interpellation - but this as usual and also giving you credit - shows that you already have much more than I can give you in terms of information, so you are absolutely asking rhetorical questions to which you already have the answers. Above all because, in reality, also with respect to questions no. 54 and no. 55 this morning, we have provided a whole series of information. I will start from the end. I did not say that I did not show up for conciliation: I said that I cannot show up for conciliation because in conciliation, at the prefecture offices, in these cases the Assessors cannot show up. Despite this, however, I met with the union representatives on October 29th in a very detailed meeting, which lasted two hours, in which I answered all the questions that were asked of me and we perceived, it is in the minutes, a satisfaction also on the part of the union representatives with respect to all the data that they requested from us, which were basically nothing other than the financial data that I represented this morning in response to no. 54 and no. 55. What financial data were I asked for? I was asked for the amount of the annual contribution for a maximum of 30% of the costs, pursuant to article 12 of no. 34/2004. I represented this morning that we went from a contribution, pursuant to article 12 of no. 34/2004, of 860,000 euros in 2018 to the current 1,600,000 euros. I was then asked what the contribution is regarding the per capita quota: it was 1,874,000 euros in 2018, it is 2,600,000 euros today, also because we went from a per capita quota of 115 euros for protected women... of 125 euros for protected women to a current per capita quota of 130 euros for protected women and 140 euros for protected women plus, so naturally it has grown. Then there are of course extraordinary contributions regarding current expenses, for example the current 750,000 euros for what concerns the contribution to contractual expenses, increasing for this sector. It has been done for other local authorities, it has also been done for the Jean Boniface Festaz. I recalled the extraordinary contribution for investments of 500,000 euros regarding the water columns, also following the inspection requested by you to go and look at the community hospital in finding this type of problems that were promptly transferred. All this means that in all respects we have gone from a transfer in favor of the Jean Boniface Festaz of 2,734,000 euros, contributions included in 2018, to the current 5,220,000 euros. If this is then transformed into minutes given to the elderly in difficulty at the Jean Boniface Festaz, to date we are record holders in this sense at a regional level, with absolute respect for the minutes for people in difficulty at this facility. Naturally, if we also transform all this into a per capita quota, also in this sense the Jean Boniface Festaz is absolutely the facility in the Aosta Valley that most respects this type of parameters. Of course, once you have done a 120-minute analysis, ... two hours compared to the current 10, you will understand that there was a possibility of going into the subject in an absolute way. Let's get to your questions, because otherwise, after I have represented everything to you for the umpteenth time in reply, you tell me that I have not answered every single question punctually. Let's therefore come to answer no. 1, which is the state of the art with respect to the opening times of the new Community Hospital. The PNRR, which financed the Community Hospital at Jean Boniface Festaz, foresees that the structure will open in spring 2026. Regarding the construction, we can report that the completion works relating to the entrance area and the gym are underway, while the department is already almost finished, therefore respecting the times and foreseeing the delivery and installation of all the furnishings. Coming to question no. 2 ""if it is true that the health care workers employed for 36 months at Jean Boniface Festaz have not been hired despite the many vacant positions"": the Company reports that there are six vacant positions of health care workers in the nursing home service as regardsthe current change in the organizational chart, however it should be noted that four of these remain temporarily covered by permanent staff and assigned until August 2023 to the RSA and UAP social-health service, which has not temporarily transferred to the USL Company. These four OSS staff units will be assigned to the Community Hospital when it is at the Festaz. It is only at that time that the four OSS positions at the nursing home will actually become free, because to date these people are obviously working within the Festaz in the other departments. To date, therefore, contrary to what was claimed, the vacancies for OSS figures are actually two and not six. It should also be noted that in the second half of 2023 the Jean Boniface Festaz Company stabilized 10 OSS with full-time and permanent contracts, drastically reducing the vacant positions which in turn are covered with fixed terms. The positions temporarily filled by temporary staff are linked, among other things, to replacement contracts for long absences of permanent staff. It should be noted that none of the operators in question have or will reach with the existing relationships a period exceeding the 36 months of service that you mention. Having taken note of the final approval of the organizational chart, the Festaz Board of Directors has deemed it appropriate to authorize the Director to hire full-time and permanent n. 2 OSS, in order to fill the only two vacant positions that are in fact present to date, as we have highlighted. Therefore, as a result of this, there will be no OSS positions not filled by permanent staff until the opening of the Community Hospital. Coming to question n. 3 ""if the vacant staff present in the organic endowment to be assigned to the operation of the Festaz has been proposed to the staff with limitations"", the Company reports that there are currently no vacant positions in the concierge service, as also recalled in the questions (points no. 54 and no. 55) this morning. Coming to question no. 4 ""the developments of the state of agitation proclaimed by all the Aosta Valley unions with the explanation of the Administration's intentions to try to re-establish a collaborative climate"", as already specified and recalled this morning when discussing the questions, the regional offices of the competent prefecture services, regarding the management of the conciliation attempt initiated by the unions against the Festaz Rest Home, have communicated that the conciliation attempt had a negative outcome following the meeting of 30 October last, where, I reiterate, the Councilors cannot participate, however they had answered all the unions' questions the day before... between the parties who can naturally present themselves. However, it is useful to highlight that the minutes reveal some positive ideas in this sense from the nursing home, which communicated that starting from 2025 it will be possible to allocate additional resources for staff replacements and also that two of the six vacant OSS positions will be stabilized shortly, thus recalling that the other four are covered by permanent staff, temporarily assigned to the nursing home and who will transfer to the Community Hospital only once it opens. It will open, was the first question, therefore from the spring of 2026, so there are 18 months to be able to make a whole series of choices. It is also useful to point out that, even with respect to the requests that came from the staff who were present in the health facility and who should then go to open up with the Community Hospital, these professional figures, therefore the OSS and the nurses, have all asked together to be able to transit to the Parini - these are the resources that were used to reopen the Neurology Department, regarding the fact that we find ourselves in a difficult situation - and we had also said, in the project made at their request to go all together and to be able to return all together, that it would be a training moment for them. We can make it clear, after this has happened, that on their part the experience is so positive that they are even officially expressing the possibility of continuing to operaterare at Parini, both from Parini, towards this staff, both OSS and nursing, the response was absolutely positive. Also in this sense therefore we do not believe we have done something strange, but we have simply tried to find a solution that would benefit the Aosta Valley community as a whole."

47965,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,6,4066,"Councilor, no one says that you did not do good for the Community. What I say is that it was quite understandable, but it was already understandable when you made that draft agreement, so at that point, I repeat, it should have been asked of all the staff of J.B. Festaz. I also allow myself to say: why then does the staff of the micro, even that, not have the possibility of doing a training period in the Hospital, instead of those of Introd now having to go to Morgex and so on? Let's give everyone this great opportunity if that is the idea and I repeat, because, in my opinion, the plan was already clear from the beginning, that is, when it was decided to move the RSA Variney and outsource it, to move the staff to Neurology. Of course, as you said, in the draft agreement it was written: ""ensuring the same the necessary training, as well as gaining experience in view of subsequent employment at the community hospital"". I believe that people do not like to go back and forth like packages, this is quite evident, so it was quite normal for this to happen. From the beginning I have been saying: but why don't we do inter-compartmental mobility? Why isn't this possibility given to everyone at this point? I tell you, Councilor, we will monitor this very carefully because we have spent initiative after initiative on this and you remember it well, so much so that you spoke of feuilleton for a reason, because I have a folder of this type. From this point of view, I will bring them all out to you, because every time I have said to you: but why don't you do mobility? I have asked you a thousand times. If this mobility happens now, I tell all the OSS in the territory to do the exact same thing, because at this point, if the idea is to outsource everything that is outside to bring it to the Hospital, it can be a choice, then the possibility is given to everyone and not just to whoever you want. On the other hand, you continue to talk about money and that is right, because the money is put in by the Regional Administration, but, when we talk about funding, then we do not look at whether this funding goes through, how is the assistance, the quality and the working conditions? It seems to me a bit like saying that those who sell underwear do not know what their neighbor, who sells socks, does. This is what I seem to be saying. Also from this point of view, I, Councilor, invite you not only to say: ""we gave the money"", but whether that money goes through. From this point of view, you also said it today: you said that 60-day replacements are done differently and the people who are there are employed. I do not think it takes a scientist to understand that this brings an increase in work for the staff who are there and they are staff who already do a job that is not exactly a non-wearing job, so much so that we have been asking for all this for a long time. Maybe your numbers need to be reviewed because, from what I heard today from colleague Manfrin, an OSS must have just resigned, so most likely the numbers are still increasing. With respect to the fact that you couldn't go to conciliation, I wonder, if you couldn't go, why were you invited? That is, if someone can't, why were you invited? That is, in my opinion, you shouldn't even have been invited. This is my opinion... (intervention by Councilor Marzi off microphone) ...no, that you don't go to conciliation of course, but why were you invited? What I want to say is that if the trade unions asked you... and just look at another interesting resolution from October 2024, that is when it is essentially said that the Board of Directors does nothing other than what the Councilor tells them. So if the Councilor asks to rationalize, they rationalize. I don't know... I'll send you the letter, Councilor, so that we can discuss things in some way, but, from this point of view, most likely then you should talk to whoever you appointed to that Board of Directors."

To be fair, I must say that the first time agri-campsites were mentioned was, I believe, in November 2022, following a question from colleagues in the Lega group, who asked what the approval timeframe was for the law on multifunctionality in agriculture. During the response of the then councilor Sapinet, agri-campsites were also mentioned, because, completing the response, he said: ""there are still some particularly important aspects relating to the performance of some types of activities not yet provided for in the current legislation, such as agri-campsites..."" and then continued with something else. The issue was then taken up again seven months later by my colleague Minelli during an interpellation, which aimed to find out, among other things, the state of the art on the reform of law no. 29, which is the law that regulates agritourism. In the introduction to the interpellation, my colleague Minelli recalled an amendment she had presented on the law, I must say famous law no. 8, which concerned the Covid period. She had inserted an amendment where she spoke of agritourism facilities that could include open spaces intended for the temporary settlement of a maximum of three tents or caravans, for a maximum of 9 guests, for which a toilet, a shower and a sink are reserved. She was basically introducing the concept of agri-camping. I also recall my position on this amendment, which was not entirely positive. Having said that, it cannot be hidden that the phenomenon of agri-camping is an evolving phenomenon, which could be well-suited to our local reality if well-coordinated and regulated. Since it is therefore growing out of all proportion in other regions, we wonder what could be done in Valle d'Aosta and what the state of the art of the law is, whether we are at a good point, whether we want to implement it, whether we want to make a separate one. Just to know what the landing point might be."

The Coordinator of the Department of Agriculture stated that paragraph 5-bis, as well as paragraph 5-ter, which were added with law no. 8/2020, do not find organic reference in the regional law on agritourism. I would also like to point out, for the sake of completeness, that as of November 4, 2024, according to what I have been told, no request for agri-camping has been received by the offices, therefore from 2020 to 2024 to date this rule has not been implemented. During 2023, the competent offices of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources worked on a regional bill on multifunctionality in agriculture, which, among other issues, rewrites the rule on the subject matter covered in this initiative of yours. The proposal of the offices, included in the draft, provides for the possibility of carrying out hospitality activities in open spaces aimed at the stay of guests in mobile setups, provided that they are not permanently anchored to the ground and have dimensional and technical characteristics that comply with the provisions in force. This regulatory text, currently still being analyzed and defined, has been included among the objectives of the DEFR 2025-2027, approved by the last Council."

47967,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978,M,RV,2,3443,"I refer to the information reported in the article in ""Aostasera"" of September 24, where we learn the following: ""The Giro d'Italia returns to Valle d'Aosta, in 2025 possible stage arrival in Val d'Ayas. According to rumors, the location in the Lower Valley should host the finale of the third-to-last stage of the Corsa Rosa. The hypothetical date is Friday, May 30"". We also report the contents of the article in ""La Vallée Notizie"" of September 28: ""The Giro d'Italia will arrive in Ayas, possible date Friday, May 30. Confirmation of the Corsa Rosa route soon"". The article in ""La Vallée"" also reports the following details and information: ""Ayas could be the location of the Aosta Valley stage of the Giro d'Italia 108, which will be presented in mid-November by RCS Sport. According to the first rumors that are leaking out, on Friday 30 May 2025 the Corsa Rosa, which will start on Saturday 10 May and end on Sunday 1 June in Rome... should be the third to last stage from Borgomanero to Ayas with the climbs of the Col d'Arlaz, the Col Zuccore and the Col de Joux in the finale. The next day, Saturday 31, the start from Brusson or Verrès, or more likely from Canavese, for Sestriere, with the Colle delle Finestre that the organizers of the ""Tour de France 2025"" also want to include and then transfer to Turin airport to reach Rome by plane for the grand finale in the capital"". : Following these articles, obviously, in the following weeks, other articles followed, which partially reported the information we have just said, others some very close dates, but different from those mentioned. We all remember well what happened to our Region during the thirteenth stage of the ""Giro d'Italia 2023"", where unfortunately the Corsa Rosa did not pass through our roads, despite the fact that the Aosta Valley, through a working table, had worked to coordinate the organizational interventions, snow removal and decorations to best welcome the runners. In those days, the following contents were reported on aostasera.it: ""Failure of the Giro d'Italia to pass, the Aosta Valley requests sporting compensation. The request in the formal letter of protest sent to the President of RCS, the CEO of RCS Sport and the Director of the Giro. Meeting in Saint-Gervais for the Tour de France on July 16th"". We also highlight what was reported in the ANSA news of June 12, 2024 in the days of the Giro ""Next Gen 2024"": ""Valle d'Aosta is aiming for a stage of the Giro d'Italia 2025"" and the Councilor reported: ""Negotiations are underway with RCS"". The competent Councilor is therefore asked to know: whether the information reported in the various articles cited above and also those that came out subsequently regarding the planning of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" and in particular regarding the part involving our Region are officially confirmed or not; how it is intended to proceed with the objective of obtaining from RCS concrete sporting compensation for Valle d'Aosta in view of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025""; whether there are any new developments or developments regarding the meeting that had been scheduled for 16 July 2023 in Saint-Gervais during the ""Tour de France"" regarding the interest of the competent Department in bringing the largest cycling race in the world back to the Aosta Valley."
47967,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,53,"For the answer, the floor is given to Councillor Grosjacques."
47967,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962,M,UV,4,7385,"I will answer the first and second questions together. In the meantime, as you well know, obviously, with respect to the time of the presentation of the interpellation, there has been a postponement of the presentation of the ""Giro"", which was initially set for November 12, postponed to a date to be determined. At the moment it would seem the presentation will be in early January, but the date is not confirmed. Beyond the dates, which also emerge from the correspondence that I will read to you, I am not at this time in a position to confirm either the arrival of the stage, or the subsequent departure, as there is no confirmation of this, because the official confirmation, as communicated by RCS, will only be available on the day of the official presentation. As for contacts, as you correctly reported in the last part of your introduction, on the occasion of the Giro ""Next Gen"", we started to talk with RCS Sport, even if the contacts, in reality, continued after the... let's say the unfortunate stage of May 2023, which saw our Region completely skipped, to then resume in Switzerland and arrive in Crans-Montana. We had a series of meetings and telephone contacts, which I then followed up with a letter on September 11, 2024, this also in response to the second question on what we asked RCS in relation to the missed passage of 2023: ""I am following up on the meetings held to confirm the will of the autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta to host a stage arrival and departure of the ""Giro ciclisto d'Italia 2025"", the route of which is being defined by your organizational structures. With this and in the spirit of great collaboration that has always existed between the entire Aosta Valley community and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"" I am asking you to evaluate as the main option the possibility of having the stage arrival at the Colle del Grand San Bernardo in the municipality of Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses, at an altitude of 2,473 meters above sea level, already identified as Cima Coppi in the unfortunate Borgofranco/Crans-Montana stage of the edition of the ""Giro ciclisto d'Italia 2025"". 2023"", whose passage, due to adverse weather conditions, had to be replaced with the provision of the passage of the riders inside the Gran San Bernardo Tunnel, which in turn was then definitively cancelled, with great disappointment also and above all for the great work carried out by the local communities to welcome the Giro caravan in the best possible way. The arrival of the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would therefore be a fair and dutiful recognition certainly appreciated and prepared with great professionalism..."", then a series of other considerations. On September 20, I received a reply: ""We have received your letter of September 11 regarding the request to organize a stage finish at the Colle del Grand San Bernardo and we thank you for your interest in the Corsa Rosa. The proposal is certainly very fascinating, but at the same time we must take note of the logistical non-feasibility of a stage that ends at the top of the pass. The set-ups of the arrival stages of the ""Giro d'Italia"" require large spaces for the construction of the hospitality areas, the TV compound, the sponsor village and all the service structures. Several parking areas are also needed for the vehicles of the team, the organization, the media and all those who follow the ""Giro d'Italia"". While on the one hand we are unable to accommodate your request, on the other we are available to study a sports project that can enhance your Region and return the Corsa Rosa to the people of the Aosta Valley, given the historic fruitful collaboration that unites us and that led, during the current year, to the great start of the ""Giro Next Gen"" for athletes under 23. The plan for the ""Giro d'Italia 2025"" would foresee the last stages taking place in the north-west of the peninsula and then returning to Rome for the final stage. In this context, a stage arrival and a start the following day in your splendid Region would fit in perfectly. The two stages would be inserted, as previously mentioned, in the last weekend of the race, to be precise Friday 30 and Saturday 31 May, configuring themselves, at least on paper, as decisive stages of the Corsa Rosa"", then a series of other evaluations on the returns of the presence of the ""Giro"". The dates should thereforebe confirmed because the problems - and I continually use the conditional precisely because we do not have certain news - should only concern the first week of the ""Giro"", while from the second onwards everything should be confirmed. I can therefore confirm the dates at this point. Together with the ""Giro d'Italia"" there will be a stage of the ""Giro"" for electric bikes, the ""Giro d'Italia"" with the pedal-assisted road bike is interesting and increasingly followed. It is a ""Giro"" within the ""Giro"", with teams formed by former professionals in the team and by real captains appointed to win the final classification. They are joined by VIPs, invited from stage to stage, to further ennoble a starting group of absolute value and level, not only in sports. The mileage of the individual sections is around 50 kilometers. To this must also be added the section of the stage pedaled by cyclists invited by the main sponsor Mediolanum. Also in this case at the start there will be former professionals and well-known figures from the world of entertainment and business. Associated with this, we are thinking of creating a stage committee that can work to enhance the fraction, involving the territory and the community with, for example, among other activities, a cycle-pedal race that can involve all the actors of the professions linked to the world of the mountains. As for the third question, as you reported, there had been a contact to have a meeting on July 16, 2023, through the Mayor of Saint-Gervais, with the general director of the Tour, Christian Prudhomme. The assessment made after appropriate checks highlighted that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to be able to communicate with the management of the Tour during the very hot days of the race, risking having little attention and putting at risk the goodness of the project itself, filed in Paris in 2019, called ""Tour du Mont Blanc"", which involved Haute-Savoie, Valais and Valle d'Aosta in a triptych of stages. One of the hypotheses at the stage level included the departure from Bourg-Saint-Maurice, the entry into the Aosta Valley from the Colle del Piccolo San Bernardo and the arrival in Pila. It was therefore decided to postpone in view of more appropriate situations, dedicating time and resources to first of all bring the ""Giro d'Italia"" back to the roads of our Region, also because, making the parallel with the stages organized by some Regions of the North, therefore Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Piedmont, in the great departure of the ""Tour de France 2024"", which involved these regions with three stages and a departure on the fourth day, the cost that was communicated to us via short routes amounts to approximately 7 million euros. Today therefore these are resources that would not be available for an activity of this kind."
47967,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,5,44,"For the reply, the floor is given to colleague Brunod."
47967,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Manifestazioni sportive",en,Brunod,Dennis,1978,M,RV,6,4096,"I listened carefully to the Councilor's response regarding this long-awaited stage, but let's say stages that will be in 2025, but above all long-awaited by the people of the Aosta Valley after what happened in 2023. Obviously you cannot bypass the institutional steps that must be taken by the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", so you gave us some information to clarify a little what was reported in the newspapers. We understand that the precise details cannot yet be revealed at this time. What you said well and that is right that it is then reported in the media is that the precise dates will be the 30th and 31st. We said this because we learned from the newspapers on the date of October 28th, in ANSA news it was reported - I think from a press release from the Regional Council - that you confirmed the two stages and the dates of May 29th and 30th had been written. On the same day, ""Aosta News"", which always took its cue from this press conference, reported the 30th and 31st. It is therefore also right to specify these dates so that things are clearly understood. These dates are certainly very positive because, as we all know, the end of the ""Giro d'Italia""... will then be the decisive days for the general classification and therefore, in terms of spectacle, it will be a great sporting and technical spectacle in our region. We hope that, as has been reported in the newspapers, highly technical routes will be identified, because our roads are such anyway. In the second stage, assuming these locations that have been described unofficially in the media, therefore with a possible arrival in Val d'Ayas and a restart in the valley floor, which could be Verrès, we hope that the restart could perhaps include a route that does not start immediately from Verrès towards the valley floor, to try to better enhance our region, our roads and above all all the excellences of the Aosta Valley. We are certain that the arrival of that stage, that is, the previous day... which will arrive inside the Aosta Valley and then go to the Ayas Valley... that stretch will already be covered, so replicating it in the exit would be a bit of a duplication in terms of international showcase. This is a passage, then we know that it is not easy to be able to do what you want, but surely, if you lay good foundations, or give suggestions, maybe in time you can do things as one hopes. The other issue: you spoke of committee initiatives to best enhance our territory. We share this aspect a lot, they are fundamental, in fact we thank in advance all the volunteers, associations, Administrators who will work to better enhance the passage of these athletes of the caravan, because, as I said, events like the ""Giro d'Italia"" have great visibility and therefore we must seize these opportunities in the best possible way. Here too, you probably cannot reveal more details to us. We hope that in the discussions that have taken place between the Department and the organization of the ""Giro d'Italia"", always referring to what happened in 2023, there has been the possibility of putting together a media plan that is as rich as possible in terms of promoting everything that is our Region from a historical, cultural and naturalistic point of view. We all know that, when there will be a live broadcast, that is, the decisive phases of the ""Giro d'Italia"" that will arrive in our region, therefore with a live broadcast that goes worldwide, if we manage to transmit as much as possible everything that is part of the Valle d'Aosta system, it will be a great result for everyone. We therefore hope that this work has been done and that on the other side RCS has taken these ideas, but above all... we repeat again... how can we say it? has put in the maximum effort to give this great result, remembering what happened in 2023."

47968,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,2,2962,"Let's go back to talking about commerce in this Assise, about small commercial activities, which are increasingly being absorbed by large-scale distribution. There have been rumors for quite some time now, in Verrès, about the possible relocation of a well-known supermarket in the Lower Valley, which I will not name. This possible relocation to a more strategic area has triggered a heated debate among local traders, who express significant concerns about the impact that this reality could have on their businesses, already tested by the economic crisis, the high cost of living and, in particular, by the phenomenon that persists throughout the territory, both nationally and in the Aosta Valley: that of commercial desertification. The fear of traders is evident, the relocation and possibly its expansion could further intercept potential customers, thus eroding the shares of small shops already put at risk, precisely as I said before, by the phenomenon of commercial desertification. I would also like to point out that concentrating spending in a single point of sale could alter the face of the historic center of Verrès and thus reduce the wealth that circulates within the Community, with negative repercussions on the local economy, a concern that, in our opinion, is more than understandable. I reiterate that we, as an opposition group, will always try to find concrete solutions to strengthen the economic and social fabric of the Aosta Valley. Allow me at this point to point out that the commercial landscape is constantly evolving: on the one hand, large-scale distribution, which, in our opinion, must absolutely be regulated, and on the other, small neighborhood businesses, two different retail models with their own strengths and weaknesses. Large-scale distribution offers a wide choice of products, competitive prices, convenience, but at the same time has disadvantages, such as perhaps the lack of customization, environmental impact and less attention to quality. On the other hand, small neighborhood businesses offer a more personalized and, if I may, even a little more human shopping experience, quality products and, above all, they contribute to keeping our villages and towns alive. It is clear that these businesses also present significant challenges, higher costs, a more limited offer and, consequently, the difficulty of competing with large-scale distribution. Having highlighted these differences between the two businesses that constitute the commerce sector, let us now move on to the purpose of this initiative. The undersigned calls upon the competent Councilor to find out whether this information is true and, if so, what strategies are intended to be implemented to protect commercial businesses that risk being swallowed up by large-scale distribution."
47968,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,77,"Councillor Grosjacques asked to speak for the answer, he has the floor."
47968,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962,M,UV,4,6524,"With reference to the first question regarding the news of a possible inclusion of a supermarket in the former Vuillermin Marmi area, in the municipality of Verrès, I would like to point out that in this regard there are no communications of any kind in the files of the Department. The Municipal Administration of Verrès, which we consulted on the matter, also informs that to date the Municipality has not filed any building application for the construction of a new commercial building on the lot of the former Vuillermin area. The only building permit relating to this area, filed in 2024, in fact concerns a remediation intervention of the asbestos roofing of the existing warehouses. At present there are therefore no elements that allow us to confirm or deny the news. I could also end it here, because the Municipality has correctly responded on the basis of the documents it currently has available, but I think it is more correct to give an answer, because the ""it is said"", the ""it is heard""... There are some things that are in progress, not formalized, for which I allowed myself to hear the proposer of the initiative, who represented to me that at the moment the intervention concerns, as I told you, the removal of asbestos sheets on three warehouses forming a single body, located a short distance in particular from the school complex and the micro-community for the elderly, a removal intervention that therefore I believe is to the advantage of the community. A new request for building intervention will then be presented for a total redevelopment of the area, with the drafting of the PUD, as provided for by the general municipal regulatory plan, with the aim of transferring the current medium-sized sales structure activity? you didn't mention it, so I won't mention it either? currently located in the same municipality, a short distance away. The new structure would not accommodate new types of goods, therefore no restaurant, no hamburger joint, no parapharmacy, as is obviously heard from the rumours in the village, nor larger surfaces than the current ones, except for a new fishmonger's department in the spaces needed to guarantee a quality service for a business not present in the municipality of Verrès, nor in the neighbouring municipalities. As for the structure currently occupied by the sales structure in question? I believe that this is also part of the reorganisation?, the intention of the promoter of the initiative would be to place a non-food product there that is not present in the area. With regard to the second question, namely ""what strategies do you intend to implement to protect the local commercial activities that are facing competition from large-scale distribution"", we reiterate that the Regional Administration is fully aware of the importance of the widespread presence of commercial activities in the area since commercial activities preside over and keep our communities alive and provide essential services for residents and tourists who visit our region. One could therefore imagine protecting local businesses by introducing restrictions on the establishment of specific categories of production and commercial activities, perhaps on the basis of product or size criteria. However, this path - and my colleague Ganis knows this very well - is not viable because no regional intervention can ignore the principles of protection of competition, freedom of establishment and the free provision of services. Principles that, in application of the Bolkestein directive, prevail in most cases. In this regard, I recall that in 2013 there was this article 1 bis, which we refer to in all inspection activities and which therefore I do not want to repeat, because it is perfectly known. In its current formulation, therefore, the regional law on trade, taking into account the specific territorial characteristics of the Aosta Valley, establishes that free access and the exercise of commercial activities can be limited only when the objective is to protect health, workers, cultural heritage and the environment. The Department is now defining a new update and refinement of regional law no. 12/1999 to pursue the best possible balance between the constraints of compliance with the principles of protection of competition, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services: the positions set by European and national legislation and the needs for protection of the territory in a broad sense. Furthermore, regional legislation enhances small commercial businesses in accordance with the principles of the Landscape Territorial Plan, with a view to protecting mountain settlements and small nuclei. This enhancement is implemented through urban planning choices that are essentially the responsibility of municipal administrations. In fact, even if the municipal general regulatory plan is subject to verification of subjection to strategic environmental assessment, the government of the municipal territory is and remains the prerogative of the Municipality and, in the absence of imperative reasons of general interest, which I listed a moment ago, there are no tools that allow the Region to prevent a local body from allocating an area of ​​its territory to the establishment of a medium or large sales structure. Therefore, since it is not possible in most cases to select or limit commercial activities on the basis of the size of the sales spaces or the types of goods or services offered, the Region intervenes with incentives to support commercial activities deemed important to ensure balanced development of the territory. This is what we are doing with the contributions in favor of neighborhood businesses and with the subsidized loans for investments or for the creation of liquidity, provided for by regional law no. 19/2001, with which the Region supports investments for the opening and renovation of commercial businesses. I will close by saying that there are further support initiatives, in addition to those I have just mentioned, that are also being studied in favor of commercial activities, in particular, a bill to support energy efficiency and innovation in tourist-hospitality and commercial activities is currently being prepared... more of a study than a preparation, with resources already included in the 2025 budget."

47968,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,6,1485,"I thank the Councilor for the response and for his attention to a sector, that of commerce, which is a sector in particular difficulty. I thank you again for having examined this issue in greater depth. Personally, I have done nothing other than bring to the attention of this Council, that is, I have done my job, the concerns of many traders and also those of neighboring countries, who do not look favorably on this possible move. Furthermore, it is one thing to take into account a move, excuse me; on the other hand, it is a move with an annexed expansion of the sales area, which will not happen, as you have clearly highlighted. At this point, however, politics comes into play, because there are two ways: either focus on large shopping centers, or make the most of our small commercial and neighborhood businesses. I therefore close, I have already mentioned it several times, because the law on commerce, which is particularly dated, antiquated, should be updated. We have said it many times, we have been saying it for years, also taking into account all these problems that we are experiencing at the moment, that twenty years ago did not exist, therefore e-commerce, large-scale distribution and the economic crisis. We, as a group, will continue to monitor and bring the requests of the traders to this Council. I hope that today ? and I do not know until when ? the traders of Verrès can still rest easy and sleep soundly."

47969,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,2,3639,"Today, however, I would like to draw your attention to a topic of fundamental importance, which is the question of the cost of living, a topic of great current interest and concern for the citizens of the Aosta Valley. The high cost of goods and services compared to other Italian cities significantly affects the quality of life and the economic well-being of the Aosta Valley population. Allow me to bring to the table an article that appeared in a well-known newspaper, whose name I will not reveal: ""From a survey by Codacons (Coordination of associations for the defense of the environment and the rights of users and consumers), in 2024 Aosta is the Italian city where living costs the most, while Naples is the cheapest. It is best to do food shopping in Catanzaro, while Bolzano boasts the most expensive food and drink trolley. Goods and services also have higher costs, for a total of 573 euros. Comparing the most expensive city and the cheapest, it turns out that in Aosta the average cost of living is around 57% more than in the Campania capital"". Returning to our beloved Region, the causes of the high cost of living that contribute to the increase in prices are many: the geographical position, being a mountain city, the costs of transport and distribution of goods are higher than in flatter areas; the seasonality linked to tourism; the local economy strongly linked to tourism, especially winter tourism, so the high demand in certain periods of the year can increase prices; the higher cost of living, so salaries and pensions are not always able to compensate for the increase in prices; we also have the problem of limited supply, so the presence of a small market can limit competition, favoring the maintenance of higher prices. All this, allow me, generates a negative impact on the lives of the citizens of the Aosta Valley, hitting precisely the most vulnerable groups. Many families struggle to make ends meet and are forced to give up essential goods and services. The increase in prices erodes the purchasing power of citizens, limiting the possibility of consumption and, finally, the high cost of living could push more people to leave our Region in search of more favorable economic conditions, therefore also in defiance of the policies to combat the phenomenon of depopulation of internal areas and mountainous zones. Considering that this issue is also very much felt at a national level, many organizations and institutions are involved in monitoring and managing this phenomenon. I remember that at a national level, Istat, the Government, the AGCM, which is the Authority for Market Competition, the UNC (National Consumer Union), are involved, which have the task, precisely, of monitoring the trend of prices and intervening in the event of anomalies or speculation. Therefore, if on the one hand these organizations and institutions can contribute to protecting consumers, on the other hand it is necessary to implement a policy of support and assistance to Aosta Valley families in difficulty. Based on these considerations, our group asks the competent Councillor to find out which retail price monitoring tools are currently in use and whether the Council intends to engage in dialogue with the most representative trade associations and representatives of the distribution sector in order to explore solutions that can promote greater transparency and competitiveness in prices, such as the promotion of sustainable commercial practices."
47969,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,3,59,"In response, Councillor Grosjacques asked to speak."
47969,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962,M,UV,4,5909,"With regard to the first question, the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, as part of the initiatives undertaken to defend the purchasing power of families, as you highlighted in your illustration, has activated through the action of the Guarantor for the surveillance of prices, also known as ""mister prezzi"", a supply chain monitoring project that, to date, relies on statistical information coming monthly from the markets at origin through the Institute of Services for the Agricultural Food Market, at wholesale through the Italian Telematic Commodity Exchange of the Chambers of Commerce system and at consumption through the National Institute of Statistics. The information collected, which also concerns the monthly price levels of consumer goods and services in the Aosta Valley, can be consulted on the website of the Price and Tariff Observatory of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy. The same website also publishes analyses and in-depth analyses on price trends. Last June 27, with the signing of a protocol between the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, the Ministry of the Interior and Unioncamere, an experimental monitoring project of the consumer prices of some food and agri-food products sold in the main retail markets, in the regional capitals or autonomous provinces, was included in this system of detection and sharing of information. The project is aimed at experimenting with a new method of monitoring prices, with particular reference to agri-food products sold in local markets and in the regional and autonomous province capitals and has the objective of strengthening the surveys at territorial level and the level of analysis of consumer prices on the basis of detailed investigation plans and through interaction with users. The project also includes the activation, by the prefectures, of specific observatories, which will see the participation of a plurality of stakeholders, including consumer associations registered in the list referred to in Article 137 of the Consumer Code. In particular, the protocol of 27 June 2024 provides that consumer associations, in addition to the aforementioned observatories, are also involved, through the Directorate General for Consumers and Market of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, in the implementation phases of the initiative on the territory, contributing to the collection in the markets of information and price data necessary for the implementation of the protocol. To this end, the Ministry of Business has published two notices: a first notice that was rejected on 18 September and a second notice, on 26 September, to collect expressions of interest from consumer associations registered in the list referred to in Article 137 to participate in the price collection. The entities thus identified upload the price data collected on the territory into a software made available by the Ministry itself, which forwards the data to the Guarantor for Price Surveillance. The observatories are currently being activated in the various provincial capitals. The observatories are assigned the task of monitoring the trend of consumer prices in the identified sectors, of analyzing any problems and of making reports to the Guarantor for Price Surveillance. The Observatory meets at least once every two months and at the same time draws up a report on the trend of consumer prices to be sent to the Guarantor for price surveillance. The special Observatory in Italy is based at the Prefectures and the Regions are not part of it, even if evidently in the case of our Region there is participation in the prefectural activities on the basis of the protocol signed by the Ministry of the Interior. In Valle d'Aosta, as in many Regions and Provinces, this special Observatory was established at the Prefecture and the survey activities have been started with reference to two local markets in Aosta. The data collected will be sent directly to the Ministry via the Chambre Valdôtaine. As regards the second question, obviously we return to the point that we have already discussed in some way in the previous interpellation. I want to say that the activation of the Price Observatory in Valle d'Aosta will constitute a new additional venue in which the dialogue with the d: The various stakeholders in the distribution and consumer sectors will be strengthened and institutionalized, with meetings at scheduled intervals, according to the methods just illustrated. The purpose, as mentioned, is precisely that hoped for in the question you asked, that is, to promote greater transparency and competitiveness of prices and in this regard the Department has asked to be able to acquire the reports and any relevant documents that will emerge also for subsequent assessments for the purposes of amending the rules on trade. I will not repeat the issue of local businesses, because we know it by now. Within the framework of the regulatory framework currently in force, the Department grants contributions in favor of local businesses to mortgages in order to support competitiveness in the distribution sector, as well as to protect consumers and guarantee them a widespread service throughout the territory, as well as other initiatives under study such as those I illustrated in the previous answer. In conclusion, the Department supports the initiative in favor of consumers also through the granting of contributions to consumer associations both with funds from the regional budget, pursuant to regional law no. 6/2004, both through the participation of the Department in ministerial calls for tenders annually aimed at the same purposes."
47969,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,5,43,"For the reply, the floor goes to colleague Ganis."
47969,XVI,"COMMERCIO, Disciplina, attività, professioni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,6,2064,"Thank you Councilor for your reply. I welcome the Councilor's commitment to intervene with measures aimed precisely at reducing the cost of basic necessities. You also told me about these projects that are being implemented: in Valle d'Aosta we have this special Observatory, we hope they do something. What I want to tell you is that every day, unfortunately, we hear stories of families forced to give up - I'll get to the heart of the initiative - essential goods and also of young people who leave our valley. Many elderly people, after a life dedicated to work, struggle to meet expenses, even basic ones. I therefore believe that we cannot remain inert in the face of the difficulties of our fellow citizens, so it is our duty to seek all possible ways to guarantee them a dignified life. For this reason, we must implement all possible solutions, even by revisiting policies that may have been implemented, therefore, to address the high cost of living in our region, it is necessary to involve institutions, associations, businesses and citizens. Now I come to the heart of my initiative. Allow me to point out some solutions. You mentioned a couple, I will tell you others, in my opinion, important, always with a view to effective collaboration: incentivizing local production, implementing collaboration between consumer associations, giving support to local businesses, but also introducing maximum price caps for some basic necessities. In all of this, however, we have an important and fundamental role in combating the high cost of living through fiscal policies, investments in infrastructure and support for families. We talked about it in the other Council, where we also talked about vouchers for families in difficulty. Therefore, solving the problem of the high cost of living is a complex process, it takes time, but through a joint commitment it is possible to improve and guarantee greater social equity."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,1,139,"Let's continue with the motions. Item no. 87 on the agenda. For the presentation of the motion, the floor is given to colleague Erika Guichardaz."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,2,4659,"At the end of this session we will talk a little about national politics, our colleague has already done so this morning, in some way anticipating some of the themes of this motion and so I will also have the opportunity to respond in some way to the observations he made this morning. We all know that the bill: ""Provisions on public safety, protection of personnel in service, as well as victims of usury and the prison system"" has been approved in the Chamber. This bill is now in the Senate. We highlight that in the 38 articles of the ""Security"" bill there are 13 new types of crime, plus various aggravating circumstances, including: article 10, which provides for imprisonment of up to one month for blocking a road or railway committed by an individual and from six months to two years if the crime is committed by several people together; article 15, which opens the possibility of prison also to pregnant women and mothers, and to newborns; English: Article 19, relating to crimes of violence or threat and resistance to a public official, with the aggravating circumstance provided for if the act is committed to prevent the construction of a public work or a strategic infrastructure, such as, for example, the bridge over the Strait or the Turin/Lyon railway line; Article 28, which authorizes public security agents to carry certain types of firearms without a license; Article 32, which provides for the closure of businesses for 5 to 30 days for shopkeepers who sell SIM cards without identifying customers and so on. With all these new rules inserted, the Government has decided to want to manage numerous social issues, in our opinion, in the most illiberal way possible, that is, by repressing with the use of the penal system of prison, rather than opening up to dialogue and listening, while intervening to alleviate the problems that afflict citizens, which is what we would expect from a democracy. For us, balancing security measures with the protection of individual freedoms is important and for this reason we recall the principle that security policies should in no case compromise the fundamental rights of citizens, such as privacy, freedom of movement and expression. In this sense, there is already an initial response to what colleague Manfrin was saying today, because this flyer was on the union noticeboard, in my opinion, rightly so, because even the workers' right to demonstrate is affected in some way. I highlight this because it seems to me that, from what he said, then I did not check on the union noticeboard, but it is not that all the initiatives are there... evidently there are initiatives that are more dedicated in some way to workers. I have not analyzed with the attention that my colleague has given to the issue of the noticeboard, but an initial response, in my opinion, is there. A right, which is the right to demonstrate, is currently being somewhat limited by the ""Safety"" decree, so I think it is important for workers to know that demonstrating can become a crime against them. We also believe it is important to provide for monitoring and transparency mechanisms for the new measures so that their application can be controlled and that they do not lend themselves in some way to abuse. Democratic control is essential to prevent the tightening of safety regulations from being used disproportionately. This is why the challenge is very simple. In the meantime, we will understand what our colleagues think, many of us participated in those demonstrations, they also authenticated signatures, so, from a certain point of view, they also took action on this issue and what we would like to somehow bring out is what the Chamber thinks, certainly having some certainties with respect to the person in front of me, because I can already imagine what they will say. The commitment, however, is to activate the regional government, to take action towards the Aosta Valley parliamentarians so that the national government and the parliament are asked to remove this bill, which for us is in some way also an attack on democratic principles that we believe are important. As I was saying, I can already imagine what some people will say, but this is our thought and this is what we are saying.so we also wanted to submit to the Chamber and understand what our colleagues think. It is noted that from 19.41 President Bertin resumes the presidency."

I definitely, personally, do not approve of this bill. There is no doubt about that. But where am I going to get lost here? On the commitment. The commitment of this motion has ended, it can no longer be done, it is in the past. The Deputy has already voted. It was necessary to ask the Senator, who we know very well...

47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,6,1045,"I will of course try to explain first of all why the Members of Parliament are being asked. This is a question of institutional courtesy, because, from a certain point of view, we have two Members of Parliament. After that, I imagine that the Member of Parliament also has contacts with Senators, right? Let's hope at least that in some way he not only works with the Senator, but also works in other ways. This is to be hoped for, that he is not there alone and scattered. What we are therefore asking in some way is that he also take action to ask for the deletion, that is, from this point of view, I believe that he can do it very well regardless of what he voted or did not vote for, whether he has already voted, and so on. Taking action to ask for the deletion is something he can very well do. From this point of view, therefore... if you then want to amend and write that we are only asking the Senator and you want to do this, however, it would be important to understand what your position is, which cannot hide behind, sincerely, these reasons that we have heard at this moment."

I would make a proposal: either withdraw the motion and, as forces opposed to the provisions of the bill, perhaps, I don't know, present a national legislative initiative in the Council that seeks to repeal a law approved by the State and therefore the Left forces are united and present... or there could actually be a modification to the commitment where the writing is proposed, obviously there will not be a vote in favor from our group, I'm saying it already, we will abstain, or present the initiative so that someone, who in this case is the Government, writes a legislative text of council initiative, perhaps by the pen of a Councilor of the majority, certainly very expert in this... to present a legislative bill of council initiative towards the Italian State, which seeks to repeal this type of commitment. I doubt that it will be supported by Senator Spelgatti, I don't know what the Deputy can do, but it could be a proposal. With this commitment, we cannot vote on it because the excerpt today, once approved, can objectively be requested...

47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Padovani,Andrea,1986,M,FP-PD,24,7,Thank you.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,25,33,The floor goes to Councilor Manfrin.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,26,1620,"Just to draw your attention to two actions that have been carried out: the first is a sentence that I did not understand well and I would like to ask you to verify, because it seems that the Councilor, addressing someone on this side of the room, uttered a sort of insult, an invitation, we could call it that. Since the colleague has always been very prompt in obviously reporting expressions of a certain gravity, we would like it to actually be verified what this expression was and for this, obviously, we would like to act accordingly; if instead it did not exist and we misunderstood, well, no problem. Secondly, we point out that for the second time the colleague has addressed some Councilors who are part of this room with obviously disrespectful references, such as ""circus councilors"", evoking periods of history that are now, clearly, dormant. I therefore believe that everyone here in this room has the right to be able to be there and to be able to agree or disagree with what is said, but the dignity of all the members of the Council must be guaranteed. I would kindly ask you, President, to apply your role and to avoid addressing people who are in this room who think differently. Therefore, all the speeches, the interventions of this world are legitimate, but I ask you, please, to avoid disrespectful expressions and above all disrespectful of roles, because one can think differently, this is obviously legitimate, but respect must always be there."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,27,73,"All right. Councilor Marguerettaz has asked to speak, he has the floor."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,UV,28,1446,"I am intervening because I would not like an absolutely incorrect interpretation of the Rules to become a precedent. I am sorry, but, Mr Manfrin, you cannot invoke a point of order and interrupt the speech of a Councillor, because in this case the Council becomes a hubbub and I must tell the truth that this passage makes me ashamed, because you say, invoking the Rules, that the main question is suspended, but it is suspended after the previous speaker has finished speaking! You cannot intervene by blocking people! Because otherwise everyone here invents a motion and while you are speaking, since I invent something, you interrupt me or I interrupt you. That is not the case here! It means that the point of order interrupts the discussion, but you must let the speaker finish! That is the Rules! Allow me, Mr President, you cannot tolerate... I therefore intervene so that it remains in the minutes so that this interpretation does not have to be repeated. Today this issue is closed, but it is not that someone has the right of veto and intervenes and interrupts the speaker, it is not like that! It is written that ""they have precedence over the main issues and suspend the discussion"". The discussion, in the sense of reservations. You make a reservation, Padovani finishes and then you will say everything you have to say. You have no right to interrupt a speaker! But where have you ever seen an interpretation like that?"
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,29,350,"That is exactly the case, otherwise the logic would not stand. In this specific case, Councilor Padovani allowed his speech, but obviously the right to finish the speech must be guaranteed, otherwise, there could be no discussion. This is the logic, Councilor. I give you the floor for a short speech, two minutes."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,30,1050,"Even one. Just to clarify that in article 60, points of order, as Vice President Marguerettaz rightly said, it is written that ""they cause the discussion to be suspended"". The suspension of the discussion is specified, if you look, in attachment 24, because ""the Rules of Procedure Committee, in the meeting of 23 November 2000, decided not to generally admit points of order for the verification of the quorum that interrupt the speech in progress of a Councillor, while other points of order for a point of order made during the speech remain admissible, in such a case causing the temporary interruption"". This is a resolution of the Rules of Procedure Committee of 2000, which means that the rationale of the rule is that the point of order interrupts the speech. This is the choice of the Rules of Procedure Committee and this is written in black and white. I'm sorry, Mr President, but I said something to you because evidently that is how it is, so more than that... I made the point."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,31,236,"It should be a point of order, not a motion that interrupts to raise personal matters. There is a point of order, the order is invoked and it is verified... this was not the case. The floor is given to Councilor Di Marco."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Di Marco,Aldo,1962,M,PA,32,467,"Yes now, wool goat, Regulation... the fact is that we made a fool of ourselves this time too, when it was enough to wait for Councilor Padovani to finish and then he had every right to say what he wanted. We managed to make a fool of ourselves again, President, so perhaps it would have been better if you had intervened a little earlier. Because that way, in my opinion, even on the outside they see us as paillasse [literal translation from the patois: clowns]."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,33,57,"Are there any other interventions? Councilor Padovani, please continue."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Padovani,Andrea,1986,M,FP-PD,34,4221,"I would start from the beginning. The ""Security"" decree represents an attack on individual and collective freedoms, represses dissent and aims to transform citizens into subjects. The Right addresses every problem with a new crime and new aggravating circumstances without putting 1 euro to truly strengthen policies of urban security and social cohesion. It hits fragile subjects, such as pregnant women and children forced into prison, instead of alternative measures... it represses every form of dissent, even if exercised with non-violence or passive resistance and it completely unjustifiably undermines the industrial hemp supply chain or at least it tries and later I will explain why. From the introduction of the crime of arbitrary occupation of a property intended for someone else's domicile, punishable by 2 to 7 years of imprisonment, to the transformation of roadblocks from administrative offenses to criminal offenses, which rightfully earn the nickname ""anti-Gandhi law"", since it provides that anyone who blocks roads or railways incurs a penalty of up to one month in prison and a fine of 300,000 euros... if there are more than one person protesting, perhaps gathered in a demonstration of workers of a union, and here is the connection between the ""Security"" decree and the unions, the penalty increases from 6 months to 2 years in prison. There is no shortage of specific sanctions for those who protest against public works defined as strategic, such as the bridge over the Strait or the TAV, currently sanctioned with light sentences and fines. From Ilaria Salis, accused of having participated in an illegal occupation of an abandoned building in 2008 to the latest demonstrations, the majority led by Giorgia Meloni does not forget anyone in its repressive dedications. A package of measures is dedicated to prisons, not seeking solutions to the problems that are highlighted and denounced daily, first and foremost the suicide emergency, which unfortunately we witness month after month. The direction that is taken is the one that is least useful. The postponement of the sentence is made optional for mothers of children under one year of age or for pregnant women, and the crime of riot in prison is also introduced, which includes not only violent acts, but also passive resistance to orders, such as hunger strikes, punishable by 1 to 5 years. Then comes a new aggravating factor to the crime of incitement to disobey the laws: if committed inside a penitentiary or against detainees, the sentence can be increased by up to a third. Same rules in the CPRs, the Repatriation Detention Centers, treated, as seems logical to the Right, as real detention centers, with the addition of the ban on purchasing a telephone SIM card for migrants without a residence permit. With Article 18, and by decision of the Government, light cannabis is equated to narcotics, making its sale, importation, processing, distribution and transportation in any form illegal, destroying, or at least trying to destroy, thus, in fact, an industrial chain, a provision fortunately suspended by the TAR of Lazio, which ruled in favor of the growers of this plant. The urban daspo is extended, that is, the ban on access to some urban areas even for those who have only been reported or convicted in a non-definitive manner in the last 5 years for a series of crimes if these occurred in stations or airports. The so-called ""security decree"", which some have rightly renamed ""repression decree"", is a liberticidal law, which brandishes the Penal Code against unions, students and all those who want to express their dissent even in a non-violent way, a decree that responds to the problems and social injustices of our country by increasing penalties, disregarding our Constitution. These rules, in addition to not solving the problems, aggravating the work of the police forces and clogging up the courts even more, will only worsen the current situation, creating a climate of greater insecurity among citizens. This is evidently the ultimate goal of those who have been living politically for years, fueling fears and conspiracy theories."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,35,59,Councilor Marquis has asked to speak and has the floor.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,36,2332,"We of Forza Italia have lived this moment of discussion with discomfort, because as moderates, as a centrist group, we believe that there can be all the conditions to discuss between the parties in this chamber in a calm manner and in a manner appropriate to the institution we represent. As for the merits, we would like to make some considerations on this decree. We believe that the ""Security"" decree corresponds to the needs of the country to guarantee respectful coexistence between citizens. I have listened carefully to positions that are legitimate, but that we do not share at all and that are distant from our way of seeing the organization of society. Saying that we need to work on the education of citizens who live in hardship or who have problems is a fine declaration of intent, in two or three generations we will see the results. In the meantime we find citizens, according to what you say, who can afford to illegally occupy a property, someone else's private property and should not be punished. There are citizens who can demonstrate in the middle of a highway, who can block the country, who can block railway lines, who can block transport. In your opinion, does this mean demonstrating? Democratic demonstrations are done in a different way because of our way of interpreting the organization and democratic life of a country. It seems to us that, in this respect, there was a need to intervene, because we must also be respectful of the freedom of others. It is not that because I claim a right, my freedom, I can undermine the overall organization of society. There are ways to express one's principles, one's voice and one's ideas, in our opinion, in a very different way from those we have heard represented. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we are deeply convinced that we need a little more security in this country, that we need conditions that guarantee the conditions for everyone to live peacefully. In our way of seeing and interpreting the institutional organization, we cannot allow the lives of others to be undermined. For this reason, therefore, on the merits, we announce that our vote is against the proposed commitment."

47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,38,458,"I will return for a moment, but in my part of the speech clearly dedicated, therefore without taking up any more time, to the regulatory part, simply for the last part that you expressed. President, I realize that you must also, in quotation marks, give an account to those who tried to find a reason not to interrupt the speech, but I, as I told you, made a speech on a motion of point of order because Article 58..."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,39,29,"No, it was a point of order."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,40,14445,"...yes, in my speech I think I can... since we are talking about this debate. I therefore referred to the facts that undermine the honorability of a Councilor. Having been the recipients of some invitations, I thought it was important, given that the person responsible for it was the first to point the tip, the lighthouse, the finger at other people, to point out this passage, but we will talk about this, since the recordings are there, so we will have the opportunity to talk about this later, don't worry. As for the merit of the initiative, I would like to thank my colleagues in a very calm manner, because I believe it is indeed an important topic, on which the discussion allows us to express our thoughts and allows us to express them in a way that is in any case different between us and you, who proposed it, and we appreciated, I personally also appreciated the calm tones with which you rightly expressed your opposition. I appreciated it a little less, but that's part of the game... and I understand the rather agitated intervention of those who, unfortunately, are gagged so as never to be able to speak, especially when there are issues that concern something they would like to have a say on, so as not to have their last remaining voter stolen from them, by the very two colleagues who proposed this initiative and instead are always forced into silence... in fact I saw some colleagues with particularly dark faces, while the colleague who intervened with this vehemence was throwing out weeks and weeks of brooding, of unexpressed words. To get to the merits of the initiative, let's say that even with respect to what has been said, colleague Guichardaz, certainly, when you intervene on the merits of demonstrations, you limit the right to demonstrate, but let's not forget that the right to express one's dissent is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is clear that I cannot do it in the ways I like best, but I have to follow certain rules. Obviously the Constitution also provides for the application of the rules for demonstrations. For demonstrations, it has already been said, but I think it is important, a stop has been put to some methods that objectively had proven to be particularly wrong to express one's thoughts. I believe that there is no problem, and there never has been, in organizing initiatives, public meetings, parades, marches. We have also seen it here in Valle d'Aosta, several have been done and, when they are peaceful, they do not create any problems. It is different when these then intervene and perhaps suspend a public service or create an obstacle. We have all seen, for example, the famous initiatives that have become quite famous throughout the world... in one part of the world, in the Western world, the one that allows you to do it because in others they are not allowed. I don't know, those who demonstrate for the climate, I don't know if they are all called ""Fridays for future"" or have different acronyms. The traffic block that is being implemented obviously has some big problems: if I block traffic, I don't just block the person who is going to the cinema, I block the person who is going to work and perhaps risks being fired, I block the ambulance with a person on board who risks dying, I block a series of connections that certainly do not help attract attention, indeed they are even counterproductive for two reasons: first, surely the people who remain stuck in traffic are not happy and certainly do not get passionate about the topic; secondly, cars stuck in traffic certainly produce much more CO2 by remaining stuck there, certainly those are not the methods. I have heard of the crime of riot and the ""anti-Gandhi law"", which however has actually been used incorrectly because this type of crime was introduced for prison inmates and this law provides that ""anyone inside the prison who participates in a riot through acts of violence or threats or resistance to the execution of orders given committed by three or more people gathered together is punished with imprisonment from 1 to 5 years"". Acts of resistance are also passive resistance behaviors: imagine, for example, the walks and the prisoners who refuse to return to their cells as a protest when they have to go back. We have clearly seen acts of pof that type. Prisoners clearly have all the rights, they have lawyers who visit them in prison, they can demonstrate whatever they want, there are some methods in those facilities that are not good and these methods, this same type of situation is foreseen for migrant detention and reception centers. So it is not for all demonstrations, but for some types. Then we talked about detained mothers with children. We addressed a problem that unfortunately was a serious problem, because there was a reiteration of crimes by mothers, who in reality hid behind their children to avoid ending up behind bars and who used this as an excuse to continue to pickpocket. Perhaps in our reality we notice it less, but in the situations that have subways or trains, unfortunately, this is a reality that is very present and has become a plague. I think that anyone who watches the news can notice it. Clearly, this is not about taking people and throwing them behind bars, but, since here the sentence provides for a postponement, in that case the execution of the sentence will not be postponable, not always, but ""if the judge sees the risk that further crimes may be committed and it may take place in a facility with reduced custody for detained mothers"". The penalties for those who employ minors for begging are also being increased and the maximum penalty goes from 3 to 5 years. Again: cannabis was mentioned. This Government has said it from the beginning: we are evidently against the use of drugs, whether soft or hard, we rightly do not make this type of distinction. I honestly have only one thing to say: I feel very sorry for those who, to get through their day, find their personal relaxation or outlet in ""sniffing"" a bit of drugs. I feel very sorry for him and, honestly, I think that there are different ways, different ways of being able to live one's life and also of being able to find a moment of leisure and relaxation. What has been said about the sentences is indeed true, but the Government, obviously, from this point of view, will continue to move forward. Again: we talked about the demonstrations and the sit-ins. There will be a blockade, as we said, not only on the road part but also on the tracks, because unfortunately one person on a track is enough to completely block a train and a connection. We realize what can obviously happen. What has been said... the aggravating circumstance of dissent on works of great importance has unfortunately become necessary because, for large works that are indispensable for our country, such as the TAV, unfortunately it has come to urban warfare in order to defend a work that is truly indispensable and to connect Corridor 5, which unfortunately is a necessity. Moreover, for example, the Democratic Party has never denied this position and the need to build this work when it was in Government. I believe this was a need for everyone, not just one political party. Again: penalties for damages during demonstrations have been increased. In fact, demonstrating peacefully is not only allowed, but it is desired. It is right to demonstrate and I much prefer those who demonstrate, who expose themselves, who show that they do not agree in an absolutely peaceful manner compared to those who perhaps disguise themselves and go and smash windows, go and smash cars and perhaps smash the car of a poor guy who has to wake up in the morning and go to work, who has absolutely nothing to do with it, but, ""since I have to demonstrate, I smash everything"". We remember the interview with that kid who said: ""Well, if you don't smash things at demonstrations... that is, a mess!"". Those people unfortunately must be punished and deserve to be punished, it is quite obvious. Again: there is an extension of the urban daspo. We also believe this is a useful measure to be able to restore some order in those cities that are certainly today, unfortunately, also prey to petty crime, which is defined as micro, but which in reality the people who live in those realities feel in a significant way on their own skin. In the manifesto, in the flyer that was then put on the union noticeboard, it was said that we are taking it out on migrants. You also said it, colleague Guichardaz, in your speech. Why? Because it simply inserts a common sense rule, that is, notis that you blame someone, simply the situation is created whereby, in the event that companies sell SIM cards without observing the identification obligations for customers, the sanction of closing the business or activity for a period of 5 to 30 days is applied. It is clear that you cannot sell SIM cards to people who do not even have a regular residence permit, people of this type are in theory illegal immigrants and should not be in this country. Eventually, we know, you know it better than us and you also know very well the associations that defend them, they have every right to go and ask for the right to asylum, they can do it and, if the right to asylum is denied, evidently they do not have the right to be here. If they do not have the right to be here, why should they be able to have a SIM? To be here illegally, perhaps to commit crimes? Because in theory, if they are not here legally, they cannot work, they cannot have a contract. How do they earn a living? I think these are observations that everyone should ask themselves, but common sense. I don't think there are security things, as has been said. Crime of arbitrary occupation. This hasn't been discussed, but it is important. The part of illegal occupation of housing has really become a major situation and we are also suffering from some of it. Councilor Marzi knows it... I imagine Councilor Sapinet also knows it by virtue of their occupation with respect to the residential construction part, there are people who have unfortunately illegally occupied housing, even council houses, and unfortunately send them away... not those who can't pay because they can't afford it, but those who occupy these houses because they don't have the possibility of finding another, but clearly they are abusing a right... it is obvious that they absolutely must be evicted. In fact, the crime is introduced because ""anyone who occupies and holds without title a property intended for someone else's domicile or prevents access to the legitimate owner is punished with a sentence of 2 to 7 years. The rule - this is a great novelty - also applies to appurtenances such as garages, courtyards, balconies, terraces. The same fate for anyone who interferes or cooperates in the occupation of the property, or receives or pays money or other benefits for the occupation itself"". The plague that exists in other areas of occupying council houses by renting them. Again: an aggravating factor for crimes in stations and in the metro, we said before, that we do not feel but are absolutely present. Then a whole section on the modification of the Anti-Mafia Code to make it more effective. Simply put, the interruption of benefits to relatives of mafiosi... if they interrupt relations with the relative who, in fact, has been arrested, or is a subject receiving preventive measures or subjected to a related criminal proceeding. Again - this is a rule on which we have really focused a lot -: the revocation of citizenship if there is a conviction for terrorism or serious crimes. ""The term for adopting the measure to revoke citizenship for crimes of terrorism and subversion and other serious crimes is extended from 3 to 10 years and from the final judgment to the final conviction. It is not possible to proceed with the revocation of citizenship if the interested party does not possess or cannot acquire another one"". Finally, the crime of possession of material for terrorist purposes: ""Anyone who, outside of cases of association for the purpose of terrorism and training for activities for the purpose of terrorism, knowingly obtains or holds instructions for the commission of acts of terrorism, dissemination and instruction on the preparation and use of explosive or toxic substances for the purpose of committing crimes against State officials will be punished with imprisonment from 2 to 6 years"". We believe that these are common sense choices. On this and on security, the League has evidently made very strong choices, choices that were in the government programs, choices that we have claimed and choices that are absolutely compatible, and will obviously be once approved in the Senate. Earlier, jokingly, I said to my colleague Di Marco who was speaking that it was not known whether my colleague Spelgatti would vote for the measure in the Senate. I did notconsulted with her, obviously, for this initiative, but I can say with reasonable confidence that I will not be contradicted, that obviously Senator Spelgatti will vote for this measure. She will vote for it and apply it as is right, because evidently, just as we have suffered, unfortunately, in years of Governments that tended to see little alternation, saw a prevalence of the Democratic Party, which managed to govern even when it lost the elections, for once we have an elected Government that has obviously gathered consensus on a program and on this, evidently, will carry out what it promised to do. Rightfully, regardless of the feasibility or non-feasibility of the motion, I would like to thank my colleagues for having presented it and allowed us to express ourselves and obviously I announce that, if the motion is not withdrawn, the Lega group will vote against it."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,41,59,Councilor Distort has asked to speak and has the floor.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Distort,Luca,1964,M,LEGA VDA,42,5410,"English: I thought I would respond a little point by point to the different positions expressed first by colleague Guichardaz and then by colleague Padovani, but colleague Manfrin has already expressed the position in which I recognize myself, so I think it is absolutely superfluous to continue these insights. It is quite obvious that in any case I do not recognize myself, we do not recognize ourselves in the least in those who, in the name of Moloch, must demonstrate at all costs and with all means, impede the normal activity of a company. We do not recognize ourselves. They are visions, we respect the different position, but we do not recognize ourselves in the least, just as we do not agree in the least on disarming the Police Forces. In my opinion, in our opinion, the Police Forces are called Police Forces because they exercise and have force in the name of order, or they are Police Forces and it is permitted that they do exactly what the name, the expression expresses, otherwise there is a small philological or even simply logical short circuit. It is clear that all this is not just a question of fans, because we know, among other things, that unfortunately we live in a country where the problems are not even the criminals or those who commit crimes, or those who break the rules or those who make social life difficult with their behavior. The problem is those who support these people, and there are, there are political areas that do it, but I don't want to open this discussion. We are on the other side. We are with the police, we are with an order, we are with the rules, on the side of the rules and we do all this not out of partisanship, not out of fans, but simply because we put the safety of people in a society, in a community, first. The safety of being able to do your job, of going to work and not finding a roadblock while someone goes to open their business. We are for the safety of those who get on a train and know that at a certain time this train will arrive at its destination. We are for this safety. The important thing, however, is that truly, in a way that is perhaps unusual, and that you are not used to, colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli, I want to sincerely congratulate you, because you have highlighted a weakness, which has appeared very evident in this discussion, of the majority. There was a speech by colleague Di Marco that is absolutely acceptable. I can tell you this as a soldier on leave, very strategic, impeccable. He didn't bat an eyelid. I also congratulate you, colleague Di Marco, you have found the logical way, perfectly logical, to get out of the impasse of having to take a position of choice regarding this motion, which would have put the majority in a bit of difficulty, which evidently is made up of heterogeneous political forces, a component of the Left and an autonomist component, assuming that the autonomist component is not of the Left. However, the fact remains that the speech of colleague Di Marco had its beautiful placement, a logic, a logical thread, a guiding line and then there was the intervention of colleague Padovani, on whose contents I do not recognize myself, but I also congratulate you, colleague Padovani, because telling the truth is a sign of coherence. You consistently wanted to express your political position, trying to bypass on the Left, on the far Left, the protagonists of this initiative and of this motion, the signatories of this motion. In this positioning of yours on the far Left you have demonstrated that the majority truly has enormous heterogeneity, but above all this heterogeneity is not just the fact of saying: well, let's go and recognize the egg of Columbus. What does the Left have to do with the autonomists? Which is what not only we are asking ourselves, but the Valle d'Aosta has been asking itself since 2020. It reveals the fact that all this debate and this different positioning emerged after about twenty minutes of interruption, of majority meeting to evidently, I think, I presume, decide what positions to take during the discussion of the motions. So what went wrong? You decided that there will be a part, represented by Di Marco, which represents a part of the majority and then the other part represented by Padovani, who strongly takes a political position that bypasses the signatories of the motion on the Left. This is what is curious, this is what is important, it isthis that emerges, because it is so clear that I could stay here and talk until tomorrow but I do not convince the opposing side, I do not convince my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli to change their position. I do not convince you, colleague Padovani, to change your ideological position, but I ask myself: you are part of an area of ​​a party that is also represented by your two neighbors on the bench, by the president Bertin, by the assessor Guichardaz. So are you representing the party? Are you representing yourself? I would like to understand what the others in the majority think. What is the position of the majority? Is it Di Marco's position or the other position? This is an important element and this is the reason why I compliment my colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli. You have brought to light this absolutely contradictory situation and this is the majority that is governing the Valle d'Aosta Region."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,43,59,Councilor Minelli has asked to speak and may do so.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,44,3264,"I won't take much time, I want to reassure my colleagues who are tired, and we all are. My colleague Guichardaz has already said, obviously, if we are presenting this motion, it is because we are absolutely convinced of its validity and of the fact that the ""Security"" decree, the bill that was approved by the Chamber and that must be discussed in the Senate is dangerous and is absolutely contrary to a series of issues that we believe are important. I will give just one example, which is linked to... there would be many, but I will give just this one, which is linked to the issue of the ban on selling SIM cards to irregular migrants. I will borrow the statement that was made by Oliviero Forti, who is the immigration manager of the national Caritas, who said that this is a highly discriminatory measure, especially for one issue: because it does not only affect people who are in some way totally irregular, but also those who incur this ban and therefore will be deprived of this possibility... (intervention by a Councilor, off microphone) please! ...all those who are waiting for a residence permit, who have all the requirements, have completed the process and are just waiting to have that piece of paper that allows them to look for a job and be here, will also be deprived of this opportunity. I am also reporting the position of the Church, because this was in ""Avvenire"", which I believe has not yet become an extremist newspaper. I really don't think so. There are also doubts on the part of a whole series of magistrates, prison directors, who are worried about the effects that this type of bill will have. I will move on to the second part very briefly. It was said by my colleague Di Marco that this motion is outdated, that it makes no sense because in any case the bill has already been voted on in the Chamber. Now, the bill has been voted on in the Chamber, to become definitive it must also be voted on in the Senate, but nothing prevents some parts of that bill from being modified. If a bill is approved by one of the two Houses and the other branch of Parliament makes even minimal changes, that is, it does not vote en bloc on the text that was approved by the first House, this must return. The Senate could make changes, if it makes even small changes, the text will return to the House and the House will no longer vote on the entire bill, but only on the amended part. From a formal point of view, therefore, there is nothing that prevents this from going forward. Go and see, that's how it is. If it were not so, we would have abolished bicameralism in Italy, but at the moment it is still like that. Then on a whole other series of issues that colleague Manfrin addressed, in much calmer tones than usual, but because there had already been the previous outburst, we would have to respond point by point. We don't have time, it's late, we're tired. The motion will certainly not be withdrawn and the vote, as I believe someone else has also said, will then have to, as on many other occasions, be the litmus test of what people actually say, think and act, because otherwise they are words, words, words."

47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,UV,46,4199,"Obviously not for a question of punctiliousness, but I repeat that the previous passage is absolutely not compliant, because the motions of order are specific motions. The Rules say: ""points of order or for the agenda or for the priority of votes"". Finished. What you invoked was a personal matter or, at most, you should have asked for the jury of honor, honorability. You had no right to interrupt Padovani. That said, therefore, even the reference to the evaluations of the Rules... they are specific, but you did not make any reference to the Rules, nor to the order of votes, nor anything else. On the motion I believe that in the end there is a specific activity simply to plant flags, exactly like the ""Security"" decree. Because the ""Security"" decree, you see, introduces and leverages problems that are real. How can we ignore the fact that there are real problems of public order? The problem is to understand whether the ""Security"" decree solves these problems, because this is what we need to talk about. Colleague Di Marco said: ""we are against it, but because we believe that this tool is a propaganda tool. Let me explain. If something is prohibited, because a whole series of facts are already prohibited, we do not resolve the issues by increasing the penalties. Because here we do great advertising, electoral propaganda. A whole series of crimes that you have indicated are already not permitted and so, if they are not permitted, someone should already prevent them from being committed. With this logic of saying: ""we increase the penalties"" do you think you are resolving the problem? Absolutely not. You see, when we go abroad - and, in some ways they are right -, they ask us: ""but excuse me, what is the difference between prohibited and strictly prohibited?"". If something is prohibited, it is prohibited. So you are making propaganda on the fact that it is strictly prohibited, but things already cannot be done. Today is it permitted to block the highway? No. From this point of view, that is why we say that this is an instrument that is absolutely propagandistic and, if the colleagues had had a bit of intellectual honesty, they should have recalled the contrary vote of our Deputy, who voted against already in September. From this point of view, we were already clearing the field on the fact that this majority, composed of people who roughly represent all the movements that supported the candidacy of our Deputy... to understand what the orientation was, but not because we do not know the problem! We know the problem, but, from this point of view, the instrument is an incorrect and propagandistic instrument, just as this motion is propagandistic, if you will allow me, because it is simply to be able to have a showdown within the Left area. We believe that the commitment is an unvotable commitment, because if someone had written: ""commits to urge the Parliamentarians to vote against"", it might have made sense, but what the hell kind of democracy do you have in your head? The excerpt. The excerpt of what? That is, a bill that is being discussed in Parliament... (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...no, but you didn't write what you want to excise. You spoke in general about the excise... Have you also taken on Manfrin's way of doing things? (intervention by Councilor Minelli, off microphone) ...so you're making a personal issue... no, because taken from the fact that you insisted, I think that colleague Minelli thought that that was an example to follow, therefore speaking over colleagues. The excise of what? In the request it is written the excise tout court, of the entire decree law. Look, it doesn't work like that. If it's a rag, say what you want to excise; if it's to vote against, say that we must vote against; if it's to vote against, we've already satisfied you, we've already done it. For something that has already been done, for us this motion, as it is set out, is unvotable. For the sake of dignity, we will not vote against, we will abstain, because you have presented something that is technically unfeasible."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,47,59,The floor is given to Councilor Manfrin for the second speech.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,48,5552,"Very, very briefly, first of all I understand and I understand perfectly, Mr Marguerettaz, that it happens rarely, because I have to recognize your particular ability, you have frequented this room for several years and know how this room works in depth. A couple of times, however, you have to admit that you were caught off guard and this is one of those times. As I was saying, I therefore also understand the reasoning that you made subsequently, because you will never admit it, obviously, but, if there had not been this dispute, whether regulatory or otherwise, I am sure that you would not have intervened, nor would you have expressed an opinion. You would obviously have left, as you have done hundreds of other times, for probably one of your colleagues from the majority to express themselves on the merits. You are not used to taking a position and would not have expressed the positions that you expressed, because obviously today you have a bit of post-match tension on you and that is fine and I understand it, so we know well what happens. What you probably didn't understand, however, is what the content is, but I say it absolutely without animosity and without wanting to start a debate, also because we will certainly have more to discuss in the coming days. Article 60 of our Rules of Procedure establishes that ""points of order, or for the agenda, or for the priority of votes? are three different cases, so either a point of order, or for the agenda or for priority? interrupt the discussion"". We agree on this, we have established that these interrupt the discussion and interrupt the speech: that's why I evidently said... Obviously what happens? That, if I ask with a point of order to speak, therefore I interrupt the discussion, at that point I receive the floor from the President who asks me to explain the point of order. Which, however, was not done, because, when I asked for the floor to speak, the colleague was not blocked and I was not given the opportunity to explain the point of order. I therefore stubbornly insisted, because my right was to make a point of order. The point of order, which I then made subsequently, was precisely for article 58, therefore facts that undermine the honour of a Councillor. It is therefore clear that the failure to suspend the discussion and the failure to give the floor to the undersigned evidently made me intervene in a vehement manner, also because, as you will remember at the beginning of these three days of the Council, I had received a rebuke from the President, who had accused me of being... how could we say... he had told me that I was a little too shy. Since I have an infinite series of defects, but I am not shy, I thought it appropriate to re-establish things a little and the truth of the issues, therefore evidently I thought I was defending a right. It is therefore clear that the point I made was meant to interrupt the discussion, the discussion was interrupted only at a later time, but I believe that what happened is on record and we will be able to discuss it later. On the merits, I believe that technically my colleague Sammaritani can best express the position of the League, which will obviously vote against the motion, but I also think that it is not because, colleague Minelli, I let off steam first that I am kept calm afterwards: it is because it is precisely the anger that has come out of some of your close colleagues that has persuaded me that perhaps this is the best weapon. The best weapon is precisely to highlight that exactly, as my colleague Distort said, there are positions that are diametrically opposed within the majority and I thank you for your action, which brings them out in all their violence and in all their virulence, because I know that every initiative that is made, regardless of the justifications that are given, because obviously there is no one who intervenes with this violence and with this thirst for revenge, who then would like to vote for the one he believes in... what you wrote... the person who is on your right, but would like to be on your left, because he would like to represent an even more extreme wing than the one you represent... he would like to vote with every fiber of his body and, if he did not have these obligations of the majority, because obviously the things that have been said to him for trthere are two ways to keep him in that position: one, you become the President of the Commission and, two, if you are not the President of the Commission and you are not here, the Fascists will arrive. Because they told him this, this is what happened and this is what is holding him back. I have a great passion for his resistance and stoicism, but above all a great respect for the great work that another colleague does, who has become multiple Vice President of different Commissions, who has to manage Commissions different from his own, and above all who has to try to contain and find a compromise when it comes to topics that he obviously cannot resist voting or expressing himself. With a good tug of the ear, here he is... or with a good tug of the ear or with good consultation he always manages to bring home the result. A result that is a winner for him and not for someone else, but, fortunately, the accounts will be done in the end. I truly thank you for having brought this motion and I hope, I truly hope, that you will bring others."
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,Presidente,49,63,Councilor Sammaritani has asked to speak and may do so.
47970,XVI,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959,M,LEGA VDA,50,6056,"I will try to intervene briefly, also out of pity for everyone, and certainly without presumption of putting an end to this discussion, interesting because, apart from the regulatory aspects, it has involved issues that are both technical and clearly political. Evidently they are two different visions of how to manage a State and public safety in particular. Well, I must say, I do so because I claim a certain intellectual honesty, which I am always against... I have never liked emergency decrees nor laws made on the wave of emotion, therefore, when penalties are increased following a road accident, etc., I have never liked them, because I still consider them to be chasing events, which certainly does no good to justice and not even to the management of safety and justice itself. Having said this, I must say that what has been said, also by, for example, colleague Marguerettaz, who is always astute in his interventions, is not entirely correct. In the sense that there are many other examples of cases in which there are crimes that already exist, behaviors that are already clearly illegitimate and sanctioned by the Penal Code, but then they are detailed in greater detail because in a certain historical moment there are particular conditions, for which there is a certain particular sensitivity towards certain behaviors. I'll give you an example for everyone: 612-bis of the Penal Code, which precisely because it is called bis means that it was placed after, in fact you all know, the red code, stalking, harassment. These crimes already existed, these behaviors were already crimes, but certain aspects were detailed in greater detail because they wanted to protect women in particular, or in any case people who are the object of particularly serious behaviors towards relational life, social life. The same consideration applies to this ""Security"" decree, it is obvious. Provisions have been adopted that arise from a Government that has made a particular commitment to security and that is also evidently a reaction and a satisfaction, in quotation marks, I say in a good sense, to those who voted for it, evidently, because perhaps those who governed before had not done so. If you let certain things go, you let a sense of insecurity pervade society, you will probably then have to put some brakes on it. It may also be that you do too much, but don't worry about that, on the other side there is the Constitutional Court, there are the magistrates, they do it, they will evaluate. Many lawyers have also contested this decree, then I'm not looking at the political orientation, etc., because it is quite transversal, I must say, probably for the reasons I expressed before, the Order of Physicians, etc. Very well, there is no problem, problems are solved in the courtrooms, it will be the judges, it will be the Constitutional Court that will say: ""here you have exaggerated, this is even unconstitutional"". Very well, we will take note of it, period, but that is the issue. The problem is that clearly this legislative measure, which is in progress, was naturally the occasion and what better occasion for the Left to cry out about Fascism, repression, etc., etc., but this is in the game of roles, of course. The paradox, one of the paradoxes, because there is more than one, is rather that these things come from those who have never dealt with security, or have dealt with it too little, and have regenerated that insecurity in society that then demands these answers. Colleague Padovani, we do not need to go to the United States to be protected, we already do it here because, thank God, there is a Government that now we believe protects us, but before it did not. This is the fundamental issue. The other paradox is that precisely these criticisms of this system to resolve things, that is to say to increase certain penalties and provide for certain particular cases, come from those who then, in reality, do the same things, but in a much more subtle way, because perhaps they do not have the courage to say: ""look, I make a rule in which I prevent you from speaking or, better, if you speak of certain things, you are a despicable being"". They do it in a much more subtle way because they implement a certain marginalization, a contempt for those who express different opinions. It also becomes quite paradoxical, moreover, the fact that one could think of going to dialogue with the No TAV with the dialogueor and listening, because I really think we have the wrong approach. We have already seen it extensively. On certain types of crimes I can even agree, on certain types of aggravating circumstances or rules I can even agree on the fact that perhaps they could even be excessive, but, as I say, it is not up to us to evaluate it. On other things, such as occupation... I'll give an example for everyone and then I'll close, arbitrary occupation had already shown the legislation of deficiencies. It must be remembered that within this article there is also talk of the emergency procedure for the release of the property. Here we really have to weigh up the reciprocal interests, that is, is it more important to protect the person occupying the accommodation or the owner who, poor thing, finds the accommodation occupied and doesn't know what to do? This also happens here, as my colleague Manfrin has already mentioned, it has already happened here that someone, even with public functions, in any case of protection of public property, has gone to the Prosecutor's Office to say: ""they have occupied our accommodation, what do we do?"". And the Attorney had to answer: ""I don't really know what to do, let's hope he goes away"". Do you understand? This is the impotence. There, there is a need for regulatory intervention. To summarize, precisely, let's say that this type of measures are necessary: ​​they are necessary because people want more security and therefore, if there has been some exaggeration, precisely, the bodies responsible for clarifying things will take care of it. We will clearly vote against this type of motion."

Just one consideration. Colleagues, if this is the way to put this majority in difficulty, you are really off track, really. You are so off track that, for once, the Deputy we elected two years ago two months ago has positioned himself and represented us unanimously. Colleagues, you are really off track. I'm sorry, you also make me a little tender, if I have to tell the truth, on a political level, and let's not go into the contents because I think that my Group Leader today was really very good on the contents.

This last intervention makes me smile a little, not so much because of the tenderness, but because... but not to smile, but to laugh, because you made a movie of yourselves all together, that is, you decided everything you wanted to do with this motion, what the objective was, to make one side clash with the other, to put the majority in difficulty. Read what is written and retrace the steps that we have represented here on some contents. We have no problem saying that what we have written and what we think of that ""Security"" decree is what we have thought in terms of the issues on which it is going to intervene from the first day we came in here. There is no problem, from our point of view, no intention of putting who knows who in difficulty. Everyone has their own conscience, everyone is responsible for what they believe in, what they do not believe in, for the calculations they can make or not make, for the fact of remaining consistent with their principles, their values, or not. Period. That is it. Then, whether there is an excerpt in the request or another expression has been used, never mind, it does not change the substance. We know very well that the bill can be changed completely from one House to another, or in part, there have already been precedents, that is not the problem, but if someone believes that the measure is a measure that goes against what he believes in or what he is fighting for, then vote, period. There is nothing else. There is no desire to put who knows who in difficulty. Everyone is also responsible, before a chamber, a majority or political forces, to themselves.

After that, whether you really make up stories about what we think, or whether you go and find fault with the commitments when you write laws that you then go and modify a month later, because you wrote them badly, with the offices that help you... I ask myself: but really, instead of going and finding fault, if you agree with those things, change the commitment and vote yourselves too. I find everything that happened here today in this last part of the debate truly absurd and surreal. After that, it's fine, we'll vote, everyone will take their responsibilities and say what they... I was pleased that the colleague also intervened, because often on many motions we don't hear him and it's important to also have the opinion of the political force that is most represented at the moment, so, from this point of view, thank God that he finally got his say again in this Regional Council.

Based on what has been said, I believe that my position on the issue is very clear but, in case there was any need, before reading for the umpteenth time some posts on social media with distorted information and unfounded accusations, I would like to reiterate the concept, and I will do so very calmly, to demonstrate to the entire Chamber that I am sincerely not angry. The ""Security"" decree is for me a liberticidal decree, which brandishes the Penal Code and threatens penalties in order to erase any expression of dissent. This is sincerely something that, as a citizen, worries me both for today and for the future, but there is a ""but"", as they say, and I would like to thus get to the commitment of the motion under discussion. I believe that the binding, as has already been said, is in itself out of place, because the decree, in addition to having already been voted on in the Chamber by our Deputy, who obviously rightly expressed himself against it, would commit the Senator of the League to request the deletion of a provision, which moreover - and I look at the only colleague who has had experience of Parliament, the deletion of a decree in parliamentary law does not exist, I am comforted - is impossible in parliamentary law, which her party supports so strongly. I think that this thing makes absolutely no sense. Although I reiterate my total opposition to the provision in question and have sincerely not understood what the use of this binding is, which, among other things, my colleagues have said can also be interpreted in many ways, but then in the end we vote on what is written... I sincerely, given the binding, do not see the point in participating in the vote, so I will remain in the chamber but will not participate in the vote."

On November 19, Councilor Ganis filed a bill containing provisions for the promotion and enhancement of the regional wood supply chain. On November 13, the Regional Council filed an administrative act on the periodic rationalization of public participation, which was assigned for competence to the II Commission. On November 4, the Rassemblement Valdôtain group filed a bill for the regulation of tattooing, permanent makeup and piercing activities. The act was assigned to the V Commission for competence and to the II for financial compatibility. On Monday, November 18, two letters were received. The Rassemblement Valdôtain group, in relation to the holding of a meeting of the IV Commission, highlighted the need to clarify the role of the Council Commissions. I would like to remind you that the Commissions are a branch of the Regional Council, therefore of the political bodies, and it is also good practice to separate the fact-finding phase from the political evaluations. Furthermore, the Progetto Civico Progressista group requested the delivery of an opinion on the issue of the limit of mandates in the Council: yesterday the Presidency Office discussed the issue with the offices, which will shortly be the subject of a response. A delegation of the Council, composed of Vice-President Marguerettaz and Councilors Jordan and Marquis, participating in the 36th European Regional Assembly of the APF, met on 12 and 13 November in Kosovo, on the subject of hybrid wars, a danger to security and democracy. Finally, on behalf of the Regional Council, I would like to express our condolences for the passing of Gioachino Gobbi. He was an example of passion, vision and commitment, whose name is intimately linked to Courmayeur, where he was able to represent a point of reference for the community, as well as being a capable and innovative entrepreneur. Our condolences to the family. Councilor Marguerettaz has asked to speak, he has the floor."
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,UV,2,2361,"I would divide it in two, I think there are others who want to intervene to remember Gioachino Gobbi and then I reserve the right to intervene for a short report and a short comment on the 36th European Assembly of Francophonie. Regarding the premature passing of Gioachino, I think it is worth remembering a man who has left an extraordinary memory in our community. In some ways, Gioachino is the son of a particular culture, you see, his mother is a Bertholier, who is an expression of the culture, of the Aosta Valley tradition of Courmayeur, and on the other hand Tony Gobbi, a person who was not from the Aosta Valley, but who chose the Aosta Valley as his land. You see, this situation allowed Gioachino to grow with values, with curiosity, with incredible intelligence and this allowed him to take a path that is enriching for him and for the entire community. He managed to relaunch Grivel as a leading company in a particular sector that is typical of our culture, that is, mountaineering equipment. A successful entrepreneur, but not only that, he considered himself a compulsive collector and, if any of you were lucky enough to be at his house, to hang out with him... he actually had the opportunity to collect and gather everything, a symptom of great curiosity. Accompanied of course by his loved ones, in particular his wife Betta, his children, Caterina and Oliviero, a person who also put himself at the service of the community because he was President of Courmayeur Mont-Blanc Funivie for years and always tried to create the conditions to create convergences, to create sharing, therefore an activity that we particularly appreciated. Finally, I remember just one detail of his generosity: when today we go to Skyway and we arrive at the Pavillon and we find this great work, if we look on the right, there is the old station. That station belonged to his family, to him, who gave it to our community. I believe that the Region, our community should truly evaluate and appreciate his journey. Unfortunately, today there will be the funeral. We, as a group of the Union Valdôtaine, gather around his family, I repeat, his beloved Betta, who so fondly called him the bear, and his children Caterina and Oliviero. Rest in peace."

47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,4,1909,"I believe that the title of today's press represents in summary what Gioachino Gobbi was, the visionary of the peaks. He was a visionary because he believed in innovation, he believed in re-proposed tradition, he was a great collector and I will always remember the two and a half hours spent in the summer of 2020, when he presented me with a large part of his collection with great attention to detail and he lost himself almost like a true enthusiast, more than a technician, of what he had collected in telling also the anecdotes, with which this collection had been and was being composed. However, I also want to remember him personally with one of his peculiarities, he was a visionary, he was a popularizer, he told, he knew how to tell, but in his judgments he knew how to be extremely seraphic, clear and decisive and perhaps there the Bertholier blood came out more than others. I remember him at almost every presentation of any kind of initiative, Jardin de L'Ange, where he had a seraphic judgment for everyone, for me first and foremost and I always thanked him for his very, very direct judgments. Courmayeur today loses and bids farewell to one of its sons, like many others. As Creuméyeurèns I don't know if we will be able or up to the task as Creuméyeurèns, especially the younger part, to replace or in any case to be able to carry on the legacy that people like Gioachino have left to our country. We will try to do it as best we can, without forgetting the contribution that these people have given and what they have represented for Courmayeur-Mont-Blanc but above all also for the whole Aosta Valley. The RV group offers its condolences to the family and I personally bid farewell to his wife who was truly one with Gioachino, ""One without the other - they often said - we are nothing"". She certainly won't be alone, because her family is there and that's how we want to remember Gioachino Gobbi."

I met Gioachino almost 20 years ago, introduced by the then President Caveri, when Rossignol, the company that made ski poles, was closing down with forty families who risked finding themselves on the street from one day to the next. The Gobbi family, with great courage, took over this business, making it a successful business too, creating the ABC Company, a business that is still going today, maintaining all the jobs and then also bringing the production of Grivel to Verrayes. From this point of view, the foresight and great vision of the future that Gioachino put first on Grivel and then on his other business is very evident. I would like to remember him for this debt of gratitude that I believe the community of the entire Media Valle owes to him and his family for what they did. I also want to remember him - I had the opportunity to get to know him over the years - for his human side, a human side of great sensitivity, of great empathy, which he managed to put into his work, making his company a family; all the workers in his business truly had this feeling of being part of a family that had the honor in some way of bringing this all-Aosta symbol to the highest peaks in the world. I too, partly on behalf of my community where I come from, embrace the entire family, especially Betta, Oliviero and Caterina for this mourning that has struck them so suddenly."

47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,10,2031,"English: Also on the Government side, the reflections have already been developed by colleagues and are part of a common feeling, those who have had the opportunity to appreciate the man, Gioachino Gobbi, in his different shades: a mountain man, with moments of sunshine, moments a little darker, moments characterized by the snow cover, a character with many opportunities, with the ability to find convergences, with the ability to look far, from being a man of the village to being an international entrepreneur. I think that what the colleagues have represented is a piece of Valle d'Aosta that we are all happy to have been able to share, each with his personal characteristics, each with his knowledge and his moments of intimacy and sharing. We believe that this type of situation makes and enriches, even in the saddest moments, a community within which... we must believe in these people who have given so much to our Region to be able to look forward and ensure that their teaching, their trace is not lost, but that it remains as an indication to follow for the future of future generations. I profit in queue at this very moment to speak, in the communications of the President of the Council, the announcement of Monsieur Giorgio Celesia, our representative of the Communauté valdôtaine who has just quit on these days and who is well represented by the communauté of Pollein pendant sept ans of the Communal Council, know-pompier volunteer, President of the Polisportiva Pollein pendant plusieurs années. A man here caractérisé sa vie même pour sa présence dans le Charaban, a man here a voulu être un exemple de bon Valdôtain pour suivre cells qui sont les traditions de notre peuple, qui a valorisé notre langue, qui, à sa façon, a bien voulu voulu représenter a moment of our culture, of our tradition, to him also. To your family, to your female Corinne Pieiller and Jean-Pierre, to Fabien, to Michel, our most sincere condolences and a feeling of affection."
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,11,79,The floor is given to Councillor Marguerettaz on the remaining parts of the communications.
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963,M,UV,12,3519,"I know that you have the right to have it for 5 minutes because I have two speakers at the European Regional Assembly which took place on 12 and 13 November in Pristina, in Kosovo. Also, as the President said, the title of the Assembly was: ""The hybrid war, a danger for security and democracy"".  The hybrid war is a form of conflict that combines traditional military tactics with non-conventional strategies, such as disinformation, cyberattack, the soutien au movement insurrectionnel or, indeed, the use of non-state actors. Their main objective is to destabilize or afflict an adversary, tout en évitant a military confrontation, pas seulement militaire, directe et en restant dessous du seuil d'une war ouverte. This type of warfare is often used by troops or groups likely to attack political, economic or strategic objectives, tout en maintenant a certain ambiguity regarding the origin of the attacks. The work is done on three panels: the first one is: ""Manipulation of information, cyberattack, intrusive interference and instrumentalisation of history, those actions placed in place are envisaged, comments should be defended without being distorted; the second one panel c'était: ""Les impacts de la guerre hybride et de la guerre menée par la Russie en Ukraine sur la politique, dont la politique de défense, sur les droits et sur les valeurs démocratiques""; finally, the three panelists here: ""Those perspectives pour une Europe en sortie de la guerre"". Colleagues, the delegation composed of myself, my fellow secretary Corrado Jordan and my fellow councilor Marquis, with the presence of the general secretary of the Council, Dr. Perrin, followed carefully. So, just to share some moments that were very touching, because, as long as the topics are treated theoretically and we talk about hacking, we talk about introduction, let's say, you can follow with a certain coldness but, when there are testimonies of people who live the war every day, here the emotions are different. There was Volodymyr, this Ukrainian philosopher, who every morning says: ""I have three children and I don't know if I can take these three children to school, because, when the siren sounds, Unfortunately, I cannot take them and, when I take them, when the siren sounds, instead of being at school, these kids are in the basement"". When you listen to the Prime Minister of Kosovo, who spent two and a half years in prison, tortured, to fight and have freedom, you understand that emotions change; the values ​​that we sometimes express of freedom, of democracy take on a non-trivial intensity. So we are experiencing very serious situations, we are experiencing them in the East, in Ukraine, they are experiencing them in the Middle East and these large groups are equipping themselves to carry out truly terrible activities; when we talk about cyber attacks, these are situations where reality is confuses with fantasy, but all this only leads to tragedies. So, if there is a function that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Francophone world must have, it is to try to network and create the conditions so that the values ​​of democracy, of freedom are not just words, but become effective behaviors. The delegation has drawn a contribution, it was a very positive experience and we will try to capitalize on what we have heard and learned in these three days of work."
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,13,59,Councilor Restano has asked to speak and has the floor.
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Restano,Claudio,1964,M,RV,14,1691,"I am speaking in relation to the response you provided following the letter we sent you regarding a clarification of the role of the Council Commissions, translating it into a political role. We sent you this letter because, during the IV Council Commission, a colleague, while asking a question, was stopped by the President. When asked for an explanation, the President of the Commission justified himself by saying that he had been impartial and that it was a technical Commission and not a political Commission. English: We would appreciate it if you could direct the Presidents of the Commissions, perhaps through the application of Article 9 of the Regulation, therefore by convening a Group Leaders' Meeting and clarifying that, when the Commission is convened and a politician is convened - in this case it was a Mayor who had availed himself of the right to be accompanied by a technician that he himself will have authorized -, it maintains a political function, because this is our role and not listening, not even waiting for the completion of the question... therefore, not being able to understand what the orientation of the question was, it is an assessment that we consider rather hasty, which then led to the consequence of having to stop the intervention of colleague Di Marco. We would therefore appreciate it if these situations did not happen again. If one of us went off the rails, it is right to stop them, but not even allowing them to ask a question seems really exaggerated, we are going too far. As always, we turn to you so that you can fully carry out your functions of management of the offices and Commissions, therefore we expect a response in this sense."
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,15,330,"As you have already said, Councilor, the Commissions are articulations of the Council, therefore they are political bodies, it is also good practice to separate the cognitive part from the political evaluation part, but I think everyone is aware of this. Other interventions? Councilor Minelli has asked to speak, she has the right to do so."
47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,16,2319,"I am speaking on the other part of your communications, that is, on the letter that my colleague Guichardaz and I sent you on 18 November to request your opinion on regional law no. 21 of 7 August 2007, in particular on paragraph 3 of article 3. We had already sent a letter on 15 October, we waited, in the last Council you had briefly mentioned the fact that it had been discussed in the Presidency Office and after more than a month, after 37 days, to date we have not received any response. Now a little while ago you said that there will be a response soon, there will be I don't know if an opinion or what. English: I would say I am quite disconcerted, because we know that there are times to respond, we had not even received any answers up to that moment, not even a hint of feedback to the first letter, but then I wonder how it is possible that an opinion does not arrive in such a long period of time, also because I understand that the legal system of this country provides that there is a correct interpretation of competence of the legislator and, in the case of that law, the legislator is regional, so I also believe that an interpretation by him and his offices absolutely must be there, because it is not a question of little relevance, quite the opposite. We are talking about a question that concerns the entire community, as well as the people directly involved. The failure or delay in delivering this opinion is not admissible. We are often told that people, citizens must know the law, that ignorance is not allowed and here on a law that is in force, that has existed for a long time, since 2007, no interpretation is given, we cannot understand how it works. I believe that this wait is really a bit too long and it also seems to me that the opinion should already be there, I believe that it is already there too. The fact that it is not delivered, or in any case that all this time is being taken to give an answer to the Councilors, in my opinion, President, also appears to be an omission of official duties on your part, or at least it seems to be so. I therefore urge that this opinion be there as soon as possible, because it seems to me that it is truly strange that after 37 days, on a regional law that has existed for almost 20-17 years, we are unable to give an interpretation."

(intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...no, from October 15 to today, today is November 20 and the first request was made on October 15 and that's 37 days, it really seems to me that in this time there must have been an interpretation.

47981,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,25,672,"I have underlined this both during the Group Leaders' Meeting and on other occasions -, you have a tendency to stifle the debate a bit, especially when the subjects are unpleasant to you or are unpleasant to your noisy majority. I would therefore kindly ask you, President, that the yardstick, which is correct, which was used this time, also be allowed in the next few times, if necessary, to reply, because the communications were made that certainly exceeded five minutes, we even went beyond that, three interventions were made, so this is a benchmark that we will also adopt for the next ones.

Since you adopted a yardstick that time and I in the Group Leaders told you that at a regulatory level that was not the yardstick to adopt and today the correct criterion was adopted, then this criterion from now on will be applied like this, because otherwise, as always, for friends the rules are interpreted, for enemies they are applied. That's not good, right? The Regulation says short interventions, plural, so the interventions are at least two, but there is no limit, so they are at least two, in this case three. I have no problem, indeed, I am in favor of freedom of expression, let's make thirty interventions, there is no problem, but let them be guaranteed to everyone."

47982,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,2,2472,"I refer to the question discussed in the last meeting and concerning the methods of organizational choices of Finaosta S.p.A. presented by Councilor Aggravi. We consider it necessary to share with the entire Board some considerations regarding the inaccuracies expressed in response by the colleague and then taken up by the press, so as to signify, within this room and to public opinion, the correct operation and absolute compliance with the legislation on which the choices made by Finaosta in setting up the managerial structure are based. This in a perspective of maximum transparency and sharing, with the aim of not fueling sterile controversies based on incorrect assumptions. The company, with regard to the organizational measures regarding the identification of top management approved in September of this year, confirms that they were adopted in full compliance with current legislation, national and regional and internal regulations, as well as in compliance with the applicable implementing provisions. In particular, the company highlighted that, as clarified by the most recent case law, with regard to publicly held companies, a technical distinction must be made between the recruitment of personnel from outside, for which Legislative Decree 175/2016, the so-called ""Madia law"", requires, as is known, the carrying out of selections in compliance with certain public criteria and instead of career advancements. With regard to career advancements, the Court of Cassation has recently established, in fact, the principle according to which it is to be excluded that the recruitment discipline, dictated first by Article 18 of Legislative Decree no. 112/2008 and then by Article 19 of Legislative Decree 175/2016, can be interpreted in the sense of also including career advancements. This has been implemented both in the resolution of the Regional Council no. 899 of 6 August 2024, which renews and replaces the previous resolution no. 1591 of 14 December 2022, as amended by resolution no. 454 of 29 April 2024, which in the regulatory provisions of the company applicable to the case in question.

47982,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Attività consiliare d'aula",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,4,1749,"I thank the President for clarifying, but I would also like to make a point: you are certainly right, but the time frame is not a trivial issue. The new regulation for recruitment and also for internal progressions of Finaosta comes into force on November 4 and the guidelines on which it is based are those that were approved before August 2024, so you understand that the rules are made first and then applied, not the rules are applied first and then made, because in the order and hierarchy of sources there is the national law, there is the regional law, there are the resolutions and there are the internal regulations of the participating companies and it is the same thing that was generated already on another appointment of the regional finance company in which a degree was required for a certain top figure and I remember that the Statute had not yet been modified. The time frame is therefore not trivial, because otherwise we do not give ourselves rules. Objectively, why did I refer to the previous guidelines of December 2022 and to the regulation that was in force when I presented the initiative? Because that was the regulation at that time. First you change the rules and then you do things, otherwise there is a problem of some sort. In any case, I wish the budget law good work and, I repeat, because perhaps it is not clear, that it is not a problem of updating the information by the undersigned, but it is of applying the laws and applying the rules in the order of the times in which they are approved, because I did not make the regulation on November 4, whoever did it unfortunately in that place had applied it previously, which is a bit strange. I take note of that."

The Presidency Office, in its meeting of 29 October, approved the draft budget forecast of the Regional Council and the plan of indicators and expected budget results for the years 2025-2026-2027. The budget forecast of the Regional Council for the year 2025 is set at 11,460,000 euros, of which 8,900,005 euros for actual expenditure revenue, 1,955,000 euros for transfer items and 600 thousand euros as part of the presumed administrative surplus to be returned to the Regional Administration. The total administrative surplus from the 2024 financial year amounts to 1,350,000 euros, of which 150,000 euros will be set aside for the severance pay and end-of-term allowances for outgoing regional councilors, and these will be added to the 600,000 euros already set aside for the same purpose in the years 2020-2021-2022-2023. Between the years 2026 and 2027, the budget settles at 10,460,000 euros, including incoming remittances, and actual expenses pertaining to the 2025 financial year have increased by 3% compared to the forecasts of the previous year. The expenses include the forecasts for filling the positions of the Office of the Civic Defender and the management of the Co.Re.Com. for the financing of the program of the Regional Council for Equal Opportunities and for the financing of the Association of former regional councilors. Furthermore, on November 12th, the opinion of the Board of Auditors, provided for by Article 2 of Regional Law 14/2021, was received. Are there any interventions?

It has happened several times that letters have been written by the opposition groups, as we have seen today, and the situation of some structures of the Regional Council that need strengthening has also been brought to the attention of the Group Leaders, especially in the part relating to the core activity of the Council, therefore legislative production. I would have expected - and I looked for it in the budget, but more than anything I expected, perhaps in the minutes of the Office of the Presidency - a consideration also in this aspect; certainly the answer that you informally gave me regarding the competition that is taking place at the Regional Administration can be an answer to our questions, however, forgive me, even the blanc manger is a good dessert, but it is not enough to complete the meal. I would therefore ask you - and I appeal to the Bureau and especially to the components that represent the minority - to give voice, even in the context of the approval sessions of important measures such as this, to the requests that all the opposition forces have made, because, otherwise, I repeat, we have a problem, because it is useless to ask for collaboration or proposals from the Council if on the other side there is no possibility of operating efficiently and above all that can allow us a more autonomous management of certain processes. I say this mainly to you as the guarantor of the good functioning of the administrative machine of the Council, but I say it in a broader sense, to the governing body of the organizational structure of the Council. This is intended to be more of a spur, then obviously our vote will be in favor and, having said that, I hope that we can finally, beyond, I repeat, the competitive procedure, find a way to be able to close at least this legislature in an efficient manner, as we are trying to do day by day."

The annotation made by you is absolutely on the agenda of the Office of the Presidency and is placed in an extremely complex and transitional situation such as that relating to the Public Administration, in particular the Regional Administration. An attempt has been made, as you also highlighted, within future competitions and planning, to make up for those elements of weakness that are still present within the organization of the Regional Council, compatible with the situation.

The budget forecast is not just a formal exercise, but is essentially the main document with which we intend to say what we want to do, so it is true, as is well specified, that the cost of personnel, as well as the overall management of personnel, is essentially an activity that is done with the personnel structure, therefore with the part referring to the Administration and the Regional Council, however, I repeat, at least from the point of view of positions or in any case internally also of considerations, it is the budget forecast that establishes and defines how the Council is organized.

Councilor Rosaire has asked to speak for the report, and he has the floor."
47985,XVI,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Rosaire,Roberto,1965,M,UV,2,10719,"First Permanent Council Committee - Institutions and Autonomy. Lead Committee. Bill no. 166. Second law for the maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024. This bill, aimed at the periodic maintenance of the regional regulatory system, modifies some regional laws relating to different areas and consists of 13 articles divided by sector of intervention. The aim is not to radically change the current legislative discipline and to make necessary changes aimed at improving the understanding of the text, better combining the various laws in force with the new regulations with which, in some way, they are connected. With regard to the working method followed, each Committee examined the articles of their respective competence and, where deemed necessary, made the appropriate changes. The Second Committee, during the meeting on 28 October 2024, examined the articles: - 3, which contains provisions regarding the regime of the assets of the Valle d'Aosta Region of which the regional law of 10 April 1997, no. 12, aimed at updating and simplifying the procedure for the sale of regional real estate. The aim is to reconcile the interest of the Region in not selling off its assets with that of not maintaining, in its assets, assets that are no longer functional to institutional purposes and that imply excessively high custody, safety and management costs; - 13, finally, containing the financial invariance clause. The Second Commission, in the meeting of 28 October 2024, expressed a favourable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Third Commission, during the meeting of 29 October 2024, examined: - Article 6, which inserts into Regional Law 18 January 2001, n. 5 (Organization of regional civil protection activities), Article 7bis, in order to promote informed and responsible behavior by those who are in the regional territory, with reference to the presence of risk situations present in the same, as well as in relation to the frequentation of mountain environments, taking into account the characteristics, morphology and climatic variables of the territory itself. The new law intends to promote a culture of information and a greater sense of responsibility, which allow to prevent, or in any case limit, the cases of people in danger and accidents caused by careless or negligent conduct, as increasingly frequently detected by the Civil Protection; - Article 8, which contains an amendment to the regional law of 20 November 2006, n. 26 (New provisions for the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads), in line with the provisions on the management of the safety of road infrastructures of the legislative decree of 15 March 2011, n. 35, in order to define the procedural aspects for the adoption of the regulations regarding the management of road safety along the road network under the jurisdiction of the Region and local authorities; - Article 9, which contains provisions on agriculture. More specifically, paragraph 1 modifies Article 18 of Regional Law No. 17 of 3 August 2016, which regulates aid intended for land improvement consortia, in order to ensure greater clarity of the law, so as to contemplate the financing of all expected project costs. Paragraph 2 modifies paragraph 3 of Article 23 of Regional Law No. 24 of 21 December 2016 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2017-2019), which establishes the financing, in the form of an advance, of certain aid provided for by the 2014/2020 rural development programme in favour of agricultural businesses. Taking into account that some agricultural companies have yet to receive all or part of the aid from AGEA, the proposed article provides for a further extension of one year, until 31 December 2025, from the deadline for the repayment of the advance received; - Article 11, which amends paragraph 2 of Article 3 of Regional Law 30 May 2022, no. 8 (Provisions on redevelopment interventions of residential and public building assets), in order to specify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, that the derogation, provided for by the amended article, to the general rule that establishesa the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees in 36 months concerns employment contracts aimed at implementing the interventions included in the national recovery and resilience plan, as established by Legislative Decree no. 80 of 9 January 2021. The Third Commission, in its meeting on 29 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The Fourth Commission, during its meeting on 31 October 2024, examined: - Article 4, containing amendments to Regional Law no. 29 of 1 September 1997 (Rules on scheduled public transport services), in order to simplify the administrative authorization procedure, promote the effectiveness of administrative action through the reduction of unnecessary burdens and obligations, reorganize and simplify the current legislation. The objective, in this case, is to promote the protection of individual rights, limiting the constraints deemed not indispensable and therefore making public transport more inclusive, granting all categories of people with disabilities the possibility of deciding which type of vehicle to use; - Article 12, amending Regional Law 16 July 2024, no. 11 (Regulation of the organization of employment services and the professional training system in the autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta), making a series of interventions aimed at correcting and specifying the scope of application of the provision, also in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, in line with the principle of loyal cooperation. The IV Commission, during the meeting of 31 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles. The V Commission, during the meeting of 30 October 2024, examined: - Article 1, amending Article 9bis of Regional Law 17 March 1992, no. 8 (Regional interventions in favor of a Foundation for the enhancement and dissemination of traditional musical heritage and for the development and diffusion of musical culture in the Aosta Valley), on all matters relating to the regional tax for the right to university study for advanced artistic and musical education courses, in order to adapt regional legislation to the provisions set out in Legislative Decree no. 68 of 29 March 2012, which contains a revision of the basic legislation on the right to study, which eliminates, in particular, the definition of the amount of the regional tax for the right to university study as a fixed amount; - Article 2, which contains amendments to Regional Law no. 25 (Use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region), regarding the use of the canteen service by inspection, management and teaching staff of schools of all levels dependent on the Region, to better clarify its scope of application by providing, among other things, the possibility for staff required to return, which may be in the afternoon or evening, to carry out their service obligations, to use the canteen service to the maximum extent of one meal per day; - Article 5, which replaces paragraph 2 of Article 39 of Regional Law 25 January 2000, n. 5 (Rules for the rationalization of the organization of the regional social-health service and for the improvement of the quality and appropriateness of the health, social-health and social-assistance services produced and provided in the region), in order to make it consistent with Article 7, does not provide for the approval of the program agreement with the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority following the amendments introduced by regional law no. 3 of 11 February 2020; - Article 10, which contains amendments to regional law no. 11 of 31 July 2017 (Provisions on the specialist training of doctors, veterinarians and dentists and non-medical graduates in the health sector, as well as university training for health professions). These proposed amendments aim to limit the regulatory constraint currently in force regarding the requirement of residence in the regional territory for access to the financial interventions provided for by the law in question. To this end, the intervention provides that, in relation to special training contractsregional additional training positions for doctors, additional specialist training positions with related scholarships for graduates in veterinary medicine, dentistry and for non-medical graduates in the health sector and positions reserved for health professions, access is permitted, provided that the other requirements are met, for candidates who do not meet the requirement of residency in the Aosta Valley. The Fifth Commission, in the meeting of 30 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the above-mentioned articles with the amendment to Article 10 presented by the Councilor for Health, Health and Social Policies. The First Commission acted as the lead proponent of the bill and, in the meeting of 4 November 2024, examined Article 7, which amends Regional Law No. 28 August 2001. 17 (Regulations on the functioning of the Office of the Ombudsman. Repeal of the regional law of 2 March 1992 (Establishment of the Ombudsman), in implementation of the commitment made by the Region to the State, in application of the principle of loyal cooperation. In particular, paragraph 1 of article 2quinquies of regional law 17/2001 is amended, eliminating any lexical reference that could be interpreted as limiting the protection action of the Guarantor of the rights of persons with disabilities to only persons with disabilities resident, domiciled even pro tempore or having a stable residence in the Aosta Valley, thus excluding those who are in the regional territory only occasionally. The First Commission, in the meeting of 4 November 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned article."
47985,XVI,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,247,"With the illustration of the legislative measure we can open the general discussion. The general discussion is open. Are there any interventions? Otherwise I will close the general discussion. Councilor Manfrin has asked to speak, he has the floor."
47985,XVI,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,4,5859,"Obviously, as a group, we will evaluate the measure article by article, but I believe it is useful, indeed indispensable, to focus on an article that we have already discussed at the meeting of the competent Council Commission, which is Article 11. Article 11, which is included within this law, this omnibus, which should tend to bring results, necessary, urgent changes, in short, maintenance of the text. The question, reading this article, arises quite spontaneously and I hope that my intervention can serve as food for thought: what exactly is this article for? English: We read it in the report that is attached in the article and the purpose of this article is: ""In order to clarify, in implementation of the commitment made by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of real collaboration, that the derogation provided for by the amended article to the general rule, which sets the maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts of public employees at 36 months, concerns employment contracts aimed at carrying out the interventions referred to in article 1, falling within the national recovery and resilience plan"". In essence, it seems that, reading this article... that without this intervention, the employees in question - we are talking about ARER -, therefore the ARER employees who deal with renovations, could not remain in service - who were hired tied to the project on a fixed-term basis - beyond the date of 31 December 2026, or that they could not be extended beyond 36 months. In reality, the article that is being amended states precisely... therefore this amendment here, article 11, is inserted into an existing law. What does this existing law say? In paragraph 2 it says: ""In order to ensure the recruitment of the personnel necessary for the operation of the project structure referred to in paragraph 1, in times compatible with the start of the interventions referred to in Article 1, limited to the year 2022, the hiring by ARER of two non-managerial personnel on a fixed-term basis is authorised, for a period of 36 months, extendable no later than 31 December 2026. On an extraordinary and urgent basis, also in derogation from the provisions set out in the regional regulation of 12 February 2013 no. 1 - which are the provisions for access to the Valle d'Aosta Single Compartment -, without prejudice to the verification of knowledge of the French language pursuant to Article 16 of the same regional regulation). So what changes with all this? Nothing, because it is already foreseen, that is, the fact that they could be extended until 31 December 2026 and the fact that they could be extended for 36 months remains, nothing changes for ARER employees. What changes? Very simple: Legislative Decree 44/2023, converted into Law 74/2023, in Article 3, paragraph 5, modifies, with exclusive reference to the Regions, autonomous Provinces, metropolitan cities and Municipalities, the provisions of Article 20 of Legislative Decree 25 May 2017 n. 75, which - listen carefully - on a transitional basis allows Public Administrations to stabilize personnel already in service as fixed-term employees at the same Administration. The new law allows this possibility to the aforementioned territorial ones until 31 December 2026. So what happens? The Regions, Provinces, Municipalities and metropolitan cities, until 31 December 2026, may proceed, within the available limits of the current staffing, following a selective interview - we imagine quite selective -, and following a positive evaluation of the work activity carried out, to the stabilization of the qualification held by non-managerial people, who, within the aforementioned deadline, have accrued at least 36 months of service, even non-continuous, in the last 8 years at the Administration that proceeds with the hiring, who have been hired on a fixed-term basis following competitive procedures in compliance with the principles set out in Article 35, Legislative Decree 30 March, no. 165. Verbis brevis or brevis verbis, the formula you prefer. Without this legislative change, the personnel who essentially says that the people who were employed for PINQuA and for 110% by ARER at the end of their service would have terminated their service and obviously, if they had then wanted to be absorbed byat ARER, they should have held a competition. With this change it is simply said that the funds for the projects mentioned above are for the realization of the PNRR and are not funds for the PINQuA and for the 110 and, on the basis of this, these people can be hired on a permanent basis. This need certainly does not come from the State, it is not that the State tells you: ""Listen, since you have to hire two ARER employees, change this rule for me, so at least you can stabilize them for me"". I strongly doubt that the State is concerned, given that you write that there is the principle of loyal collaboration with the State, of the hiring, of the stabilization of two ARER employees. We are therefore faced with a rule that has, as they say, a first and last name and that does not change anything, it is a bit like turning the mattress from the winter side to the summer side, unless you are the mattress, then the thing changes and in fact, the mattresses are there and there are two and they can be stabilized and hired on a permanent basis by the Public Administration with this change, which does not change anything, does not move anything and is not necessary. We, obviously, will not vote on ad hoc rules for mattresses, if you do... we wish you a big good luck but we believe that evidently here a rule has been made, let's call it pre-electoral."

I will briefly intervene on article 11, a commitment already made on the occasion of regional law 12 of 29 July with the budget change. On the issue, the Legislative Office had discussed the matter with the competent offices of the relevant Ministries, with a confidential correspondence, a commitment therefore to better detail a rule, a precise provision, which gives the possibility of derogating from the 36 months in the use of personnel, which is a consequence of the activity connected to the construction sites in progress with PNRR financing of ARER, in particular the PINQuA financing, which is financed with the 23.2 million and the nine lots of works already all awarded, most of which have already started with work in progress, therefore a correspondence that remains, which is, as said, confidential and was going to better define and concretize this procedure."

I would like to focus on article 6, which is an article that has a very important impact on the future of behaviors on our territory, a mountain territory, a territory that has a morphology, characteristics, climate variables that are very important and this article underlines the importance of the principle of self-responsibility on the territory and on the usability of our paths, our roads, our outdoor activities and it clears a path of responsibility within the users, especially of the activities that take place on our territory. I believe it is a concept that in other contexts, including European ones, is already very developed and that must become a bit more commonplace, in the mentality of those who carry out activities and who must consciously assume responsibility for the danger and any critical issues that may arise when dealing with the territory, a concept of zero risk that does not exist and that is also part of this particular moment of climate change, including geomorphological changes, which characterize especially very particular territories such as the Aosta Valley. Within this bill there are other much more specific indications, this is a somewhat broader principle that I thought was right to underline and highlight its importance in this particular temporal context."

A few more words need to be spent because perhaps with this article we are trying to fill a legislative gap at a national level, a gap that has led to a jurisprudence that is much discussed and sometimes I dare say has led to jurisprudential distortions. It is clear that, by introducing this concept of self-responsibility, we allow each individual who faces the mountains, or ski routes, or other routes in the Aosta Valley even by bicycle the freedom to independently determine their own way of facing the route, of facing the mountains, but which obviously imposes at the same time full responsibility for the choices made. Doubts arise when this person is accompanied by someone who is responsible for accompanying them. All this to say that it was an important step, but perhaps the path is still long, so this article is welcome, but the invitation is that, all together, we work on it further to take a further step forward and encourage those in the area - I see that the Councilor who deals with mountains has booked - of these very skills... perhaps our representatives in Rome can work perhaps in future legislative productions to further clarify this aspect."

I illustrated an amendment proposed by the Aosta Valley in the hearing that took place in the Senate during the examination of the bill that deals with modernizing the 1994 law on mountains. I must say that with the various interactions that we had both with the representatives of the Südtiroler Volkspartei, and in particular Senator Durnwalder, but also obviously in connection with Senator Spelgatti, there was work by the Commission and then by the Chamber that allowed us to have, within the text already approved by the Senate, a regulation that concerns this issue that should also cover that part that cannot be covered by the regional law, in particular the criminal issues, which obviously cannot be the object of a regional regulation. We are examining, also with colleagues who deal with the issues of trails and the impact on tourism, whether it will be the case to further clarify the text of the article that has already been approved, which however is already a significant step forward. Now the law goes to the Chamber, I will have the honor, as a representative for the mountains of all the Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, to be heard in the Chamber, and we will return to the point if necessary.

47985,XVI,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Cretier,Paolo,1963,M,FP-PD,16,3482,"Good morning everyone. A brief, comprehensive statement, I would say, on this beautiful day of work that awaits us in this beautiful week. The omnibus contains a series of modifications, additions or repeals made necessary to respond to the maintenance needs of the legislation in force, which requires adjustments to improve some regulatory passages and its applicability. This is my thought. For example, article 6, which makes the companions responsible, or even ourselves, especially in mountain environments, but extensively throughout the regional territory, thinking - and sometimes having the ability - to give up reaching a goal and the set objective. Giving up saves lives, our lives, but also those of those who must intervene in extreme conditions. I quote an article read in a local weekly: ""Only the rescue of the Guardia di Finanza saved 48 people"" and I would also like to quote Hervé Barmasse for his declaration of renunciation in an interview during a climb in Nepal, which he had to give up for obvious reasons, however, in my opinion, every now and then the decision must be made and you have to give up. We are at the forefront of information, the very efficient Civil Protection system that we have operating here in the Valley, is always not enough, the foundation of article 6 is self-responsibility codified by the Civil Code and in this case the realization of other people's interests without risking one's own life or that of those accompanying us and at the same time of expert rescuers, trained but operating in extreme conditions. Article 8, the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads. The complicated network of rather dated regional roads physiologically requires ordinary and sometimes extraordinary maintenance interventions, with significant financial interventions to guarantee the passability and safety of the citizen, the worker, the student and the tourist who climbs into the Valley. Of course, it is also necessary to think about alternatives to avoid closure, the isolation of economic activities and give the possibility of re-entry, which are sometimes prevented by very dangerous calamity situations. Article 9, the issue of agriculture and the company connected to it. The timing is sometimes now guaranteed by a regional complement that will be approved soon, today I hope. Sometimes the changes in data management create too many temporal hitches in the pure reading of the data, of the value of the application, for which it is necessary to extend the deadline to 31 December 2025 for those companies in difficulty. In cases of repayment of advance sums, these companies - few in truth compared to the total - can have a breath of fresh air. Article 11, a necessary derogation to carry out the interventions included in the PNRR, strengthening the administrative capacities of the Public Administrations, functional to its implementation. These are just a few examples that are connected to the III Commission of which I am a member and the mission is in particular agriculture, health of the territory, public works and civil protection, directly linked to the articles mentioned above. As a group, we will vote on the bill for the necessary changes to openings and approvals to be made today. The Federalisti Progressisti Partito Democratico group will certainly vote on this bill."

Bill 171, budget variation, is composed of 20 articles. The opinion of the auditor has been acquired, three amendments have been presented by the II Council Commission and one amendment by the President of the Region. An agenda has also been filed by the League and the Forza Italia group. The rapporteur for the majority is Councilor Malacrinò and for the minority is Councilor Aggravi.

47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Malacrinò,Antonino,1977,M,FP-PD,2,12373,"Good morning everyone. This bill contains the second measure of variation to the budget forecast of the Region for the three-year period 2024/2026 and consists of twenty articles that contain provisions for the registration of greater revenues and greater expenditures in the budget forecast. The increased resources are mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that hit the Aosta Valley on 29 and 30 June 2024. The document also contains the provisions for the ratification of the budget variations, carried out by resolution of the Regional Council, which authorized the variations arranged to make the funds available for the first post-flood interventions. This legislative provision is characterized by the registration of increased revenues in the three-year period 2024-2026 for 35.9 million euros that will be allocated to the financing of the interventions listed in Chapter I. Overall, for the year 2024, the authorizations relating to recurring expenses are increased by 2.1 million euros, the investment expenses by 32.8 million euros and the expenses for the increase of financial activities by 1 million euros. Specifically, this bill is composed of five Chapters: Chapter I relates to new authorizations for expenses and is composed of ten articles. Article 1, paragraph 1, establishes that the allocation for the granting of contributions to families and productive activities for interventions relating to overcoming the emergency, following the flood event of 29 and 30 June 2024, is increased by 3.9 million. Paragraph 2 provides for the possibility, if new resources are made available by the State, to collect them directly, without having to pass them on to the beneficiaries who have already been compensated with regional funds. Article 2 establishes the extraordinary transfers in favor of local authorities to cope with the significant investments necessary to carry out interventions to restore the damage caused by the flood. Paragraph 1 gives the Department of Civil Protection and Firefighters the power, following a survey of the damage suffered carried out by the same Department, to transfer to the Municipality of Cogne, as established in letter a), a total amount equal to 13.8 million euros for the implementation of interventions regarding the restoration, after the initial emergency works, of the municipal road system, of the seriously damaged underground services, as well as of the hydraulic regulation works usually carried out by the regional structures competent in matters of public works, territory and environment. Letter b) also provides for the transfer to the Municipality of Valtournenche, which was also seriously affected by the flooding at the end of June, for the necessary interventions to restore the functionality of the aqueduct and sewerage network, of a total amount of 4.4 million and also provides, in letter c), a total transfer, equal to 500 thousand euros, to finance the interventions connected to restoration following the flooding events in the remaining municipalities of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta. Paragraph 2 defines the methods of transfer of the funds intended for the Municipality of Cogne and the Municipality of Valtournenche, establishing the possibility, upon request of the Municipalities themselves, to provide an advance of up to 50% of the expected amount and to defer the balance of the allocation to the reporting to the Regional Department of Civil Protection and Fire Brigade of the interventions carried out. Paragraph 3 establishes that, with a resolution of the Regional Council, to be adopted after consulting the Permanent Council of Local Authorities, the list of interventions carried out in the other municipalities of the Region, with the exception of Cogne and Valtournenche, is drawn up and the criteria and methods for transferring the related resources are defined. Article 3 provides for the granting of a contribution of 500 thousand euros to the Municipality of Cogne for the organization of the ""Nordic Ski World Cup"" competitions, awarded by the International Ski Federation, which will take place from 31 January to 2 February 2025 in consideration of the important tourist-promotional implications and related economic benefits, resulting from the holding of the aforementioned competitions in the location hit by the floods. Article 4 authorizes and finances two urgent interventions for the safety of strategic infrastructures andthe territory. The first intervention aims to review the structural layout of the state-owned canal Ru Arberioz, to complete the emergency forecast action conducted during the disaster of 29 and 30 June, to ensure the supply of water for agricultural, livestock and fire-fighting uses in the municipalities of Aymavilles, Jovençan and Gressan. The second intervention instead involves the reconstruction of the state-owned canal of Ru Baudin, ensuring hydraulic safety conditions and water functionality for agricultural and livestock use in a territorial area with a high residential density and to protect the strategic infrastructures connected to the hydraulic structures of the municipality of Aosta. Article 5 authorizes the granting of direct contributions to reduce interest and processing costs applied by Finaosta on mortgages to support businesses that have suffered damage or indirect damage from the flood of June 2024, ""indirect damage"" being understood as a drop in turnover of at least 20% resulting from the comparison between the data relating to the months of July 2023 and July 2024. It is expected that the contributions will be paid to businesses through Finaosta and from the ordinary management referred to in Article 5 of Regional Law no. 7 of 16 March 2006. To provide the contributions, a special temporary endowment fund will be set up at the regional finance company for the duration of the repayment plans for loans to businesses affected by the flood and it is expected that unused resources will be returned to the fund referred to in Article 68 of Regional Law no. 3 of 13 February 2013 (Provisions on housing policies). The burden resulting from the application of this article is determined for the year 2024 at €955,212.95. Article 6 authorizes the increase in the allocation for the interventions provided for by the regional law of 29 March 2018 n. 6 (Regional interventions to support sports infrastructure in cableway complexes of supra-local interest and refinancing of regional law 18 June 2004, no. 8 (Regional interventions for the development of cableway systems and related service structures), by inserting, in derogation from the procedures provided for by the aforementioned law, the possibility of providing extraordinary capital contributions aimed at restoring sports infrastructure damaged by the flood event of 29 and 30 June. Paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively introduce amendments to paragraph 3 of article 4 and paragraph 1 of article 5 of regional law 6/2018, in order to adapt the limits of investment aid for sports infrastructure provided for by the same law to those defined by EU regulation 651/2014. Article 7 increases by 1.6 million the financial endowment for the granting of contributions under regional law 1 August 2011 no. 21 to support businesses and freelancers adhering to the bodies of collective guarantee of the Fidi-Confidi of the Region, in order to avoid the proportional reduction of the contributions granted taking into account the greater demand recorded during the year 2024. Article 8 follows the request for funding by the Federico Chabod regional boarding school to cope with safety interventions in the building where it is located, in particular for the design of the new fire prevention system, for the renovation of the smoke detection system, for the modernization of the fire prevention system, for the replacement of emergency lights, for the supply of fire doors and for the replacement of anti-trauma protection systems in sports fields, for a total expense of 200 thousand euros. Article 9 provides for the financing of 700 thousand euros necessary for the construction of additional mandatory works for fire prevention purposes and for the payment of the charges related to the revaluation of prices relating to the regional swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier as part of the architectural, energy and structural improvement intervention. Article 10 provides for the recognition of an extraordinary contribution of 70 thousand euros to the social welfare and patronage institutes for the year 2024 for the increased support and information activities carried out, to guarantee citizens access to the benefits and measures provided to support the less well-off categories. Chapter II provides for the registration of the increased revenues in the three-year period 2024/2026 and is composedby a single article: Article 11, which provides for the recording of increased revenues of €35,902,212.95 resulting from the recognition of taxes devolved on the basis of the revenue of the year 2023, including a balancing amount relating to previous years. Chapter III provides for the ratification of budget variations and is composed of a single article: Article 12, which ratifies the content of a series of budget variations adopted by the Regional Council, pursuant to Article 36 of Regional Law 12/2024, to address the first aid and relief works of the flood event of 29 and 30 June. The total amount of the decreases is equal to €21,041,164.95. Chapter IV contains other provisions and the final provisions and is composed of two articles. Article 13 redetermines, by integrating the amount, the financial resources allocated to local finance interventions referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1, of Regional Law No. 25 of 19 December 2023 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2024/2026). Article 14 contains the recognition of spending authorizations contained in regional laws. Chapter V provides for other provisions and final provisions and consists of six articles. Article 15 provides for amendments to Article 19 of Regional Law No. 7 of 12 June 2024 (Regional budget adjustment for the year 2024), amendments aimed at enhancing the value of the property called Palazzo Cogne to be used as a university residence. Article 16 provides that the term of office of the Board of Auditors for the Region, currently set at three years, be established at three accounting years, so as to allow the extension of the audit activity over an entire accounting year. It also provides for the extension of the mandate of the members of the Board currently in office, expiring in February 2025, for a further term. Article 17 contains provisions on the sale of real estate between the Region and local authorities, providing for an expansion of the scope of application of regional law no. 68 of 23 November 1994, on the sale of real estate between the Region and Municipalities. In particular, this amendment allows for improved synergy between local authorities and the valorization of their property, with the possibility of extending the use of some assets for institutional purposes to other authorities as well. Article 18 contains urgent amendments to regional law no. 46 of 19 August 1998 (Rules on the Secretaries of Local Authorities of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta) and to regional law no. 22 (New provisions on the recruitment of secretaries of local authorities in the Aosta Valley), to integrate the regulations on the recruitment of new secretaries of local authorities, in view of the next general municipal elections in autumn 2025. Article 19 lists the annexes to this law. Finally, Article 20 contains the declaration of urgency. The 2nd Permanent Council Commission, which met on 18 November 2024, examined the regional law draft no. 171 presented by the Regional Council on 6 November 2024, concerning: ""Second variation to the budget forecast of the Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley for the three-year period 2024/2026"" and expressed a majority favorable opinion."
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,59,Councilor Aggravi has asked to speak and has the floor.
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,4,10297,"The press release of the II Commission of last November 12, 2024, in addition to giving notice of the appointment of the rapporteurs of this bill, rightly represented this as composed of provisions concerning the registration of greater revenues and greater expenditures in the 2024/2026 budget forecast, mainly intended to mitigate the effects of the flood that hit our Valley on June 29 and 30. The adverb gives an account of the fact that within the provision there are not only rules or measures aimed at restoring the infrastructure and the places affected by the sad events of June, or contributions to deal with the damage suffered by families and businesses, but also of the other. In this sense, the subsequent comment, the one I will represent, will be divided into two parts: the one relating to the articles concerning emergencies and the one relating to other interventions. For the record, it must be said that in the aforementioned press release, in particular in the statements of the President of the Commission, the colleague rapporteur of the majority, among other things, there is no trace of the fact that, in addition to the hearings of the political counterparts, the Councilors and Mayors interested in various capacities, which would then have been held during the morning of Monday 18, the possibility of hearing also the representatives of the trade associations interested was denied by the majority Commissioners through the voice of the President of the II Commission. The opposition forces have criticized and are criticizing this choice even today, because it has limited the possibility for the entire Commission to better understand the problems connected to the negative effects brought about by the flood event in June. A step that could have been managed differently, in line with what, among other things, has already been done in the past for situations of similar magnitude. This is said for the record and for the facts. The first two articles are closely linked to the flood event. Article 1, allocating resources to contribute to families and productive activities through regional law 5/2021, that of the organization of regional civil protection activities, Article 2, transferring resources to support investments by the affected local authorities, including in particular the Municipality of Cogne, the Municipality of Valtournenche, as well as in favor of other local authorities. Overall, regional resources that will then be covered with national funds that will come from the procedures implemented by our Civil Protection with the national counterpart. Resources that, based on the progress of the interventions, may also, in the near future, need to be increased, as emerged during the hearings organized in the Second Commission. Article 3 allocates resources to the Municipality of Cogne as a contribution to covering the expenses incurred by the same for the organization of the ""Nordic Ski World Cup"" race. Some considerations: without a doubt, the inclusion of this provision in the scope of this provision was also determined by the timing of the assignment of the race by the International Ski Federation, just as this opportunity undoubtedly constitutes an important opportunity to relaunch the tourist resort hit by the events of last June. However, it is noted - and some colleagues will certainly add details of commentary during the general discussion - that to date the methods of support and sports competitions of this level, and not only, are increasingly characterized by ad hoc measures, cum titulo, etc., making each situation unique, without a clear underlying strategy and/or potential effects deriving from the synergy with other measures or initiatives. Article 4 allocates significant funding for the safety of two state-owned canals: the Arberioz and Baudin canals) whose details of intervention were the subject of an in-depth study in the dedicated hearing. Article 5 constitutes a temporary revolving fund, in line with the duration of the financing granted, for the reduction of the interest on the processing costs applied by the regional finance company for the granting of financing to companies affected by the flood. A measure presented to the attention of the Group Leaders during the last meeting ofupdate of the situation by the President of the Region (for the record, already partly anticipated during the September meeting); information in line with the commitment signed and approved by majority with the resolution of the Valle d'Aosta Council of 10 July. Commitment that, although overlooking the expected weekly cadence of the information on the evolution of the emergency management, was nevertheless materialized with meetings held on 5 July, 15 July, 14 August, 17 September and 1 October. The measure provided for in Article 5 was presented in the October meeting, then the final text was subsequently sent quickly to the minority Group Leaders. In this sense, it is important to clarify that there was no sharing of intent on this measure, but rather a sharing in the informative sense, following which the minority forces took note of the proposal now being examined by the Valle d'Aosta Council; we will certainly return to this point in the general discussion. It is certain - and it is good to ask ourselves about the issue - that time counts for the proper functioning of these tools and today time runs faster than the speed of legislative production. For this reason, we can do nothing but hope for a rapid provision of this measure in favor of the companies that request it. Article 6 will allow the restoration of sports infrastructures damaged by the flood event through the refinancing of regional laws 6/2018 and 8/2004. I now move on to further interventions. Article 7 defines the strengthening of the endowment of the fund for the granting of interest rate contributions to law 21 in favor of Aosta Valley companies through the Confidi. Articles 8 and 9 relate to the interventions to be carried out at the Federico Chabod regional boarding school in Aosta and on the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, interventions that certainly need to be carried out, and therefore financed, but which we would have preferred to find within the scope of a provision not necessarily linked to the emergency events of June. This is because there are certainly other measures that would require equal consideration, but which have not been brought to the attention of the perimeter of this second variation today. At the same time, we would have preferred to find, within the scope of a provision so mainly linked to the flood emergency, also other measures in favor of the entities hit by the flood last June. The same goes for Article 10, which allocates funds to social welfare and welfare institutions. As regards Articles 15, on Palazzo Cogne, and 16, that of the Board of Auditors, and 17 on the subject of the sale of real estate between the Region and local authorities, we asked ourselves during the hearings and renew here the doubt as to why they have not been included in the scope of the law for the maintenance of the regional system just discussed. I will now go into more detail on the provisions regarding the recruitment of secretaries of local authorities, of which we have, among other things, taken note of the presentation of an amendment this morning by the President. With the bill 147 for the maintenance of the regional system for the year 2024, the one presented by the Government on May 24th and then voted in June, the abrogation of... paragraph 5 of article 1 of law 46/1998 was repealed. A certainly complex issue, that of municipal secretaries and in a broader sense that concerning the legislation of our local authorities, also and above all due to the stratification over time of new laws and various articles of amendment presented for this purpose. It must however be said that during the hearings and then in the debate in the chamber on that article 5 of the bill 147 we had repeatedly asked for explanations and further clarifications regarding the consequences that this repeal would have entailed in view of the preparation of the recruitment notice for the new municipal secretaries, but nothing. Today we find ourselves with a further amendment that also arises from the path taken subsequently in the First Commission - and I would say that we find ourselves with a further one this morning -, a path stimulated by the request for hearings on the point by myself and colleagues Erika Guichardaz and Claudio Restano. This, among other things, after the same Agency of Secretaries, with a note last October, rightly asked theRegion a ruling, they asked for a legal opinion on the point, in fact it materialized with these two proposals. What emerged is that the regulatory framework resulting from the June amendment was anything but clear as we had been told and could have even led to possible problems and further repercussions on the publication of the notice by the Agency of Secretaries. On this I make a comment: in all the hearings that were held in the First Commission, we said it: our request is not a desire to disturb, but a desire to clarify and avoid the generation of possible disputes following the publication of the notice. Today we are at yet another amendment, what can I say? What is represented in this report certainly does not claim to include all the positions of the minority forces and in this sense the subsequent debate will certainly allow us to further explore more than one aspect already considered here, but it also wants to try to provide those who read and listen with good elements of reflection and a fair duty to report on the contents of this bill. I obviously reserve the right to intervene following the debate on points that are more politically sensitive for our group."
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,158,"Let's open the general discussion. The general discussion is open. Councilors who wish to speak should register. Councilor Manfrin, you have the floor."
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,6,7188,"I obviously thank the minority rapporteur who in his report wanted to represent all the parts of the opposition that will discuss the measure today, I see many colleagues already booked, because obviously there are also differences of position between the oppositions, but what is clear is that there are many dark sides to this measure that we are going to discuss. Some have already been raised, on others I will do a further study, this is a provision, which, as we know, has been long-awaited, we talked about it, as has rightly been said, in the days immediately following the flood events and however it arrives late with respect to some needs that have been reported several times and as if that were not enough, after a long discussion, the bill 171, which should have been exclusively intended for the flood emergency, arrives weighed down by various other articles that contain a bit of everything: from swimming pools to the Convitto, from the municipal secretaries to the student residence, with regulatory changes that should have found a place in the omnibus law, discussed as you have seen before this one, there would have been no problem, no criticality in transposing the rules that modify the regional rules into the omnibus and instead it was preferred to insert them in this provision. This insertion evidently causes reactions, because if it had been preferred to focus a law exclusively on the flood, as was also requested by the opposition groups in the Second Commission, the opposition council groups would also have been left free to agree or not with the content of a potential emergency law, instead it was preferred, and we must say this perhaps also in an instrumental way, to try to fill as many articles as possible without any coherence between them and it is not clear whether this is due to an administrative incapacity - and we have denounced this several times - which always manifests itself in the form of self-amendments and bills deposited by the Government, we see it, a law is deposited and then the amendments of the same Government that deposited the law arrive, perhaps even without hearings, which is something that honestly leaves one a little surprised, or - and here it would be even more serious - for a subtle political choice, that is to avoid that the minority could with its own contribution take some credit for having tried to support families and businesses in the areas hit by the flood. If that was your concern, Mr President, I will put you at ease right away. Here at least in my group - but I am sure that it is the same for the other opposition groups - no one wants to steal her alleged glory or the merits that she wants to propagate in splendid solitude, as, for example, happened last Saturday for the little party she attended, with a few other members of the majority, in Cogne, worried that someone might overshadow her, but I think it is right to tell the truth and, if collaboration is asked for, because this is what was asked of us, at least listen to the very few basic requests that came from the opposition, because, yes, the Group Leaders were updated sporadically and laconically, with information that a minute later, but often a few minutes earlier, was released by the media and on several occasions - I say this for the benefit of the record, colleague Aggravi has already done so - there was talk of sharing in the halls outside with the opposition forces, but the sharing stopped at a hearing, as said sporadic, of the Group Leaders, without any expression of assent on our part or sharing of choices or proposals. On the other hand, Mr President, this measure carries with it a very serious shortcoming, a shortcoming that alone makes some of the choices almost devoid of legitimacy, as well as revealing an evident terror of submitting them to an opinion by those who propose them. I, Mr President, believe it is necessary to highlight the seriousness of what happened in the Committee, when you decided that on a measure containing articles entitled: ""Provisions on contributions to support businesses hit by floods"", businesses should not be asked what they thought. Well yes, colleagues and also citizens of the Aosta Valley who I hope will listen to us outside this chamber, what I have just described really happened.I'm not making anything up, I was sitting right here when the minority's request to hear the trade associations, and I specify: ADAVA, Confcommercio and Confesercenti, the majority responded no, not limiting itself to a refusal but adding that - listen, listen - such hearings were not relevant to the law. A law that should provide aid to businesses should not be submitted to the scrutiny of the representatives of the businesses themselves, because this majority knows, in its unquestionable judgment, that what it does is right and the others can fend for themselves. So, since you didn't have the courage to submit this mess to the trade associations, we'll do it, carrying out a nice truth operation so that outside of this chamber it is known what the majority intends to do in favor of the businesses hit by the flood. Well, do you know, dear entrepreneurs and dear Valdostans, what the aid for businesses and economic activities hit by the flood consists of? In loans, yes, exactly, loans that will perhaps arrive, if this law is approved, in a few days, therefore, as mentioned, seriously late given that the tourist season has already begun and that will not be useful to those who have seen the tourist season taken away by collapsed roads or bad publicity from the media, which have painted our region as a huge quagmire. If you had made an investment to best face the season, but you saw your turnover wiped out, if you were preparing for the current season and your business was destroyed by the flood and your products drowned in the mud, then you will be able to take out a little money that you will then have to pay back, widening the deficit created by the flood. All this should be a help that no trade association has had the opportunity to analyze to express an opinion for fear that it might highlight its doubts or even its opposition. I say this for the benefit of the media that perhaps have been badly informed. It is not a rain of money, it is not even a dew of money, these are just funds with a rubber band that unfortunately I fear will not help anyone: this is why, in the face of this very serious choice, the responsibility for which falls on the highest representative of this majority, we have filed an order of the day that, instead of providing money with a rubber band: ""I'll give it to you and you'll give it back to me"", asks for real compensation, compensation for those who, in an emergency situation, have seen years of sacrifice and job prospects erased. We will therefore evaluate the will of this majority there."
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,7,37,"Councilor Marquis, over to you."
47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,8,5507,"I too will begin my speech by thanking the speakers who illustrated the bill that was downloaded, a bill that we imagined would be focused and place all its attention on the flood emergency, but, as anticipated by those who spoke, it contains articles that are mainly interested in mitigating the effects of the flood, but then there are also a whole other series of articles that raise doubts at an organizational and procedural level, because we also believe that they could have been contained in the omnibus provision and this perhaps denotes a bit of progress with an organizational method that leaves one thinking. Beyond this, there are also a whole series of articles for the ratification of budget changes made with the resolutions of the Council. The provision in its consistency manages 35.9 million euros that are put in the expense account, of which 2,100,000 euros on current expenses and 32.8 million euros in capital expenses. I would like to draw some attention to the first articles, which are those relating to the flood emergency. Article 1 allocates an additional 3.9 million euros for Law 5/2021, the civil protection law, to meet the needs of families and businesses, after which the other articles are essentially focused on public property, on the municipal restoration of all public works that were damaged by the flood, in particular 13.8 million are allocated for Cogne and 4.4 million for Valtournenche. Article 3 500 thousand euros in favor of Cogne for the organization of the ""World Cup""; article 4 ru d'Arberioz and ru Baudin, also provides for investments in the arrangement, after which we move on to article 5. Article 5 is an article that essentially provides for interest coverage for mortgages that will be opened to those who have suffered direct and indirect damage from the flood, to companies that have seen a reduction in turnover compared to 2023, therefore both contributions for the reduction of interest and the costs of investigation, this will be managed by Finaosta. We believe that, as a measure, it can also be a good measure, but this is not the instrument that, from our point of view, should have been used to manage this situation. A situation in which we would have hoped for a behavior by the Region that was complementary and integrated with the behavior that has been implemented at a national level, because there are a whole series of businesses and economic operators that have suffered significant damage especially in these two communities: the community of Cogne and that of Valtournenche, which cannot be humiliated in this way, but must be helped by the Public Administration. For this reason, therefore, also in the budget variation we presented an agenda that we had already presented on the occasion of the discussion of the DEFR, in which we wanted to anticipate the issue because by now the elements were clear on the table of how the management of this administrative practice was developing. Today we also had the pleasure of hearing, from all the colleagues who spoke from the opposition, that there was no sharing - as had been slightly implied when we had brought up the topic during the DEFR discussion - from the opposition regarding the substance of this initiative of Article 5, it had been a sharing of information, information had been received from the regional government, in particular from the Councilor, who had said: ""Our idea is to carry forward the solution to this problem in this direction"", a direction that we, already then, had seen did not correspond to the needs of local operators. For this reason, therefore, we have presented an order of the day that goes in the direction of introducing compensation for those who cannot obtain compensation at a national level because it is a level of competence that is not foreseen within the Ministry of Tourism. We will return to this later. As for Article 5, it is an article that can be supported in itself, but it has a substantially different purpose than that of compensation, because it is about having a tool for opening loans, which are something other than that of obtaining compensation. Then there is Article7, an article that we can also share, because, although it is not linked to the strictly emergency issue, it meets the Aosta Valley production system, implementing a transfer to the Confidi to reduce the cost of interest that companies have supported and are supporting with difficulty in this period following the increase in the interest rate also in the Aosta Valley. Then there are all the other articles, which are the articles that have been cited, which essentially regulate issues that do not concern the emergency situation, but which could have been addressed, in our opinion, within the omnibus or even within the budget forecast. We will then express our opinions on these at the time of voting on the article. As far as we are concerned, our approach will depend a lot on what the attitude and behavior of the majority will be towards the agenda that we have presented."

47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,10,9476,"The second budget change came after the budget board's approval and I also believe that this confirms the doubts about the organizational and planning capabilities of this board. Despite the urgency of the situation, bill 171 arrives four months after the floods, leaving too many to make do and, as reported in the Commission in the last Council, it arrives without sharing on such an important issue, but simply with a few information meetings. In July, among other things, with my colleagues from Rassemblement we had worked on a resolution with the majority precisely to ask to be updated weekly on the developments of the floods and the various interventions, but, as councilors Aggravi and Manfrin rightly pointed out, there were five meetings, often they were also requested in light of the fact that the news was published in the press and none of us knew anything about it. English: Sharing then, as has been rightly pointed out by all the Group Leaders who preceded me, has not even occurred in the Commission since the hearings proposed by the minority have been largely denied, while for us it would have been important to hear those stakeholders who have had to give answers in these months. In other emergency situations - and I am speaking especially of the first part of the legislature, when President Lavevaz was at the head of this Council - these sharings, especially on interventions that concerned the entire community, have occurred and have been shared so much that they have often obtained a unanimous vote in the Chamber. Let's get into the merits of the budget variation that has been proposed to us, meanwhile we note that there is a handful of articles dedicated to the emergency, which in some way provide for small contributions to families, businesses and extraordinary transfers to Municipalities, all partial and in many cases insufficient. Regional resources then, which, as has been rightly pointed out by the minority rapporteur, will be covered by national funds, therefore in some way not resources of the Region. Once again, there will be people who will not be able to benefit from any help, except perhaps the contribution of 5 thousand or 20 thousand euros, because, if they are already in difficult situations, they will certainly not go and take on new debts, which in some way can weigh on their activities. In addition, I will be told... it has also been represented to us that we need to think about insurance, which most likely does not respond to natural disasters like in this case, or that we will have to make do in some way. For businesses, we note that the season has already started and access to new mortgages, as I was saying, means having new debts. : This is then associated with the problems regarding the national funds announced with emphasis also by the Coordinator of Fratelli d'Italia and the various related declarations that have followed one another in recent days and to which perhaps Councilor Grosjacques will be able to give us an answer, because a problem has been detected, or has been detected by the trade associations, in the procedures for accessing these funds, very tight deadlines and also exclusion criteria, such as those that leave out bars, sports facilities such as riding stables and golf courses, but also many other entrepreneurial activities. According to some, the regional government was well aware of this situation, but evidently did not want to intervene in any other way. Perhaps Councilor Grosjacques will clarify this for us better. Another sore point that we highlighted in the last meeting is the issue of the redundancy fund still blocked for many workers and businesses perhaps due to inadequate State-Regional Coordination given that the answer was that the applications were incomplete, so perhaps, also with respect to this delay, it would be important to understand what the real reasons are. Even with respect to the funds for the Municipalities, as was well represented in the Commission, these will go into the multi-year restricted fund, to then be included in the 2025 budget, given that there is absolutely no time. Anyone who has managed a municipal budget knows very well that at this stage no new variations can be made and therefore here too we will talk about next year. Finally, we then note a real confusion and a bit of superficiality, which has already been noted bywho preceded me, who uses this budget variation to put a bit of everything in it. We talked about the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, which we know, there is an article regarding the auditors, regarding ru d'Arberioz, which actually had damages related to the flood, but then we find another ru and I thank the Councilor for having passed us the requested documentation yesterday, but I have not had time to analyze it, so it will then perhaps be the subject of some future initiative. As I was saying, I believe it is clear that this budget variation is also linked to superficiality and I want to dwell a bit more on what concerns the recruitment of municipal secretaries, a topic on which especially I and Councilor Aggravi have made several initiatives precisely following everything that has happened. On November 15, 2023, this majority approved law 22, which introduced new provisions regarding the recruitment of municipal secretaries; it also defined the degrees, it also defined that secretaries with five years of experience in the last ten years could access it, but only seven months later, on June 24, 2024, the same majority approved regional law no. 9, yet another omnibus, which reintroduced an old article of the 1998 law, which actually created confusion and could lead to appeals. On this, it is enough to go and look at that Regional Council to remember that the undersigned had presented a suppressive amendment, time had been requested from the Chamber to be able to discuss it since there had not been the possibility of discussing it in Committee there either, therefore, if it is said that I did not bring the amendment to the Committee, it is only because the hearings were not allowed there either. Therefore, after the presentation of that amendment in the Chamber there was a request for suspension, but then on the return, everything is fine, Madame la Marchioness, we vote and that article had been introduced. Now, bill 171 is going to modify again what was modified in November 2023, in June 2024 with yet another modification, therefore in November 2024, that is, in one year three laws have been made to somehow further mess up an aspect that we all know is of absolute importance precisely for the restart of the next City Councils. However, it is not the only thing, because, if there had been only the reintroduction of that article, it would have been a bit of a way of telling us: ""Perhaps we understood that there could be some confusion"", also supported by the President of the Register of Secretaries, by the secretaries of the first and second parties who came to the hearing in the Commission, but no, they are thinking of adding a paragraph 2 for a reserve that is decided to be for category D employees who have held the role immediately below the managerial qualification for five years, telling us in the Commission that this wording was put in for fear of challenges if another wording was used. Today we find an amendment that instead brings us back to the issue of municipal secretaries. In the Commission we are told that this can be challenged, now the amendment arrives, so I hope that checks have been done on this one, but I announce right away that of course we will not vote on it precisely in light of what was said in the Commission when the President came. Among all this then... from the discussion with the President of the register in the last hearing, we discover that two people, evidently not the two that Manfrin was talking about today, but two other people who obviously do not have certain requirements I imagine, will be excluded from this competition, because they do not have the five years, nor the ten years because they were evidently hired in the last legislature. On this passage we do not intervene, so for these who, from what the President of the Register said, are two people we do not intervene and I have absolutely not thought of making any amendment in order to avoid being told that I am doing it for personal interests, as if who knows who I may have or favor within that category. I believe all this clearly demonstrates the confusion that continues to reign even on an important topic such as this which has been an event, unfortunately, not sporadic, because we know well that we must somehow equip ourselves in the future, because things of this kind could happen again, but whatwas the attitude to respond to this criticality and if there was actually an adequate response to the needs of the population we will only find out by living. What I feel like saying is that the families and businesses that suffered those damages deserved concrete interventions shared by the entire Chamber and truly decisive, not empty proclamations and partial measures. Once again the people most in difficulty will not have any response."

47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,12,9198,"I had said that I reserved the right to make a couple of passages on some aspects of greater interest in relation to the action of our group, as well as elements of novelty that obviously were not in my possession, in our possession before the beginning of this discussion and which will then be the subject of subsequent discussion. First of all I would like to dwell on... and, in reality, the intervention is mainly linked, if you like, to this passage... so, in relation to the first two articles, but I would say in particular the first article, it must be said that, always for the correctness of the action that each one has done, we had already expressed on several occasions the need to be able to use a tool that already existed and that was rightly adopted as law 5/2001, which was born from an experience at the time even sadder for our Region and even more impactful, a tool that certainly needs to be updated, to be made more current also with respect to critical issues and risks that could not even be thought of at that time and above all also to make it especially on measures and interventions... Among other things, both with the President and with Councilor Sapinet I have often happened to solicit the Government benches in initiatives, but on this there is actually the willingness also on our part, to work to make the tools a little more replicable in all situations, precisely to avoid real situations or interventions that are a little too discretionary or tied to a single event, which risk also putting similar situations in difficulty and perhaps putting them on different levels. I say this because, for better or for worse, we must take advantage of these situations and make this instrument increasingly modern and increasingly feasible. Welcome, we have already said it and so has colleague Restano in the discussion of the maintenance law, for example, the principle of self-responsibility. There are all issues that require overall management. On this point, for goodness sake, I have also heard the interventions of other colleagues, who rightly said (I summarize): ""We need to do more, greater and different aid could have been foreseen"". Two orders of the day in particular were presented. I am saying this now in the general discussion to then encourage in the presentation of individuals perhaps a reply or in any case the possibility of allowing myself and our group to have a little more clarity, because I am objectively and politically confused, because if, on the one hand, the criticism is right regarding the fact that more should have been done or more could have been done, very right - and I have made it too - the criticism regarding the need to hear those who represent the affected realities. I found it really strange and absurd the fact of not wanting to do it and I say this above all for how the Council Commissions have always behaved and have always tried to give voice in every situation, sometimes perhaps even with too much abundance in some situations; in this one there was actually the need to make a transition so that it did not remain only tied to the pourparler or informal meetings, but giving a formality to this transition. There was also time to do it and the willingness to do it on the part of the opposition forces, but objectively I find myself - and I say it right away - in further difficulty hearing the closing of the speech by colleague Marquis, who I do not see but who I am sure his colleagues will report to him... the fact of essentially saying: ""We will see what to do then on the vote based on your positioning on the agenda"". Even though we have made a criticism, even though we are critical of a whole series of passages and also of some articles of the budget variation... and if, among other things, we had not had, in our opinion, satisfactory answers, when we had called for using law 5 as soon as possible to avoid too much time passing... I confirm that we will vote on articles 1 and 2 because we are responsible, we have taken on a responsibility and, beyond what the positioning of the government majority may be on an initiative of its own movement, for God's sake, if one believes in certain measures, one votes for them regardless, therefore I confirm that we take responsibility for these two passagesI love them and we will vote for them and we do not wash our hands of them with an objective agenda. There is however another thing that leaves me quite perplexed about these two passages. Whoever proposes them, have patience, but à maintes reprises reminds us that there are referents at the national level who are moving and working, among other things, the agenda of the colleagues of Forza Italia speaks of the prompt visit of the Minister of Tourism to Aosta on July 2 and the provision of support to economic operators in the tourism sector... let's say that those 10 million seemed a bit like Mussolini's planes, however in the end the decree brought 15 million. Now, it is not a question of delegations, of those who deal with carpentry, hotels, bars, if there is a necessary aid measure, it must touch, it must be carried forward to all the operators involved. Now that a force, which in any case supports the Government and supports the current Minister of Tourism, says: ""The Minister has done everything but the Government must plan to help or at least plan support for those entities whose Ateco Code is not included in the scope of beneficiaries referred to in the decree of the Ministry of Tourism as it is not within its jurisdiction"", it seems truly absurd to me. Why hasn't something been done at a national level to also involve the other Minister or Ministers who had the delegations to act? Objectively, if I had been in the situation of my colleagues, I would not have presented this agenda, because I objectively ask myself: but you have so many relationships with the Roman referents, but what did you tell them on this point? And what did they answer you? I can't ask forces that are not represented here, and obviously it would also be interesting to know from their side, but objectively I say to myself: ""What does this agenda have to do with it - someone would say -?"", but I'm confused, so maybe you can give me an explanation. Then bear with me if I make a small political passage, but you know who is touched then rightly must also defend themselves, you continue to talk about a united Center Right, but there are two different agendas of the united forces of the Center Right, so even on this maybe a passage by me... but precisely to help me overcome the confusion, because otherwise the confusion is even greater... I don't think of myself perhaps but at the home of others and I say this because rightly in the past Councils we have made an effort to look at the home of others, so then I allow myself to look also at the home of others, but rightly perhaps you will answer us and convince us that this action is valid. Then, for goodness sake, as two characters who are both Mao Tse-Tung and von Moltke, a great Prussian marshal, actually said... we must march divided to strike united, but here it seems to me that we are not striking in unity, but you will explain it to us. Just three more steps: one is linked to the issue of time that I mentioned before, zero-rate mortgages, for goodness sake, are welcome, they are certainly a useful measure for those who have the possibility of subscribing to them, however, beyond the fact that in any case the capital quota must then be returned, the sooner they are made available the better, because today we are talking about November 20 and those who have thought about the season and everything else have already equipped themselves differently. We therefore hope that they can be made available as quickly as possible. On the Pré-Saint-Didier swimming pool, almost all the minority groups have made initiatives, we have had the opportunity to delve into the reason for this allocation, I objectively ... if I'm not mistaken, councilor Sapinet spoke of the spring of 2025, we hope that this is the last and that we can finally get to the point, because otherwise things risk going even further. On the subject of municipal secretaries, I think that I can endorse the intervention of my colleague Guichardaz, which is a passage that I feel like saying, especially after the last hearing, but I don't give it as a criticism, I give it more as a topic for reflection. On the subject of municipal secretaries, we continue to talk about the number of secretarial offices. Until the secretarial offices are defined, it is difficult to identify the optimum number to put out to tender, so this is a problem that, in reality, does not affect the law so muchon secretaries, but in a broader sense the reforms or the reform of the legislation of local authorities. Having said that, the solution will probably be found a little further down the line, let's try to be optimistic."

47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Baccega,Mauro,1955,M,FI,14,3474,"Evidently Professor Aggravi, who is uttering sentences left and right, is in dire need of clarity regarding his new political grouping, namely he is part of the Valle d'Aosta Autonomist Center grouping, on the opposition side, but not so much of the opposition, because this intervention gives strong support to the majority and, on the other hand, with obviously the two Councilor Assessors in the majority with one councilor and the other councilors who are part of the opposition, we immediately understood that there is already a relationship... and that is what we had anticipated in the intervention some time ago, namely that there would probably be different attitudes and behaviors... frankly we would not have expected this attack. Going into the merits of what we are facing, on October 1, 2024 we are called by the President of the Council to a Group Leaders' Meeting, in which I participated, where the President informed us that a legislative measure would be put in place that would support businesses and so on. Obviously it was an idea of ​​strong sharing, sharing that in reality - all the colleagues who spoke said - did not exist and that somehow saw us then deal with a provision that anticipates responses and resources to the affected businesses and inhabitants of Cogne and Valtournenche, but not all, because the rules do not allow it, because from October 1st to today and in the path from July to today, because it was July 2nd when the Minister of Tourism communicated that there would be resources available, so I am sure that the representatives of the Council could have discussed to understand if everything was planned, even bars, rentals, sports facilities, or if those Ateco codes were not planned that then suddenly seem to have disappeared... it is clear that that Ministry cannot provide resources for that part. As I said last time in a Regional Council, sometimes you have to go knocking, we have done it in the past, we have always done it, but not with a hat in our hand, you have to go and say: ""Look, maybe there is a misunderstanding. I am sure that we can go in the direction of changing"". But what does the budget of this Region make available to these affected populations? How many resources does it put in place? Not advances, resources. It simply puts in place financing that, it is true, does not cost businesses, but in some way leads to indebtedness for businesses. I also make the declaration of vote because that was more or less what I had undertaken to do with my colleagues, a declaration of vote that is simple, of this bill all those articles that go in the direction of giving support to businesses and contributions with respect to the flood of 29 and 30 June we are in favor of, we will vote for them. Obviously we will not vote for the entire structure of the law, because we will vote for those articles that we believe are in support of the people of the Aosta Valley. As for the political path, probably this Forza Italia, which sometimes is not even called, I see this fil rouge from PCP to Rassemblement, I see this fil rouge that now runs and probably Forza Italia is annoying. We are therefore very happy about this, we want to characterize ourselves as being liberal, of the Center Right, liberal, even autonomist, but constantly growing and this makes us very happy."

47986,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Restano,Claudio,1964,M,RV,16,3261,"I am a poor inhabitant of a rural mountain area, I ask however for the possibility to intervene to complete what was expressed by my Group Leader, who had already anticipated a little the intervention by the other Rassemblement Councillors. I will therefore not go into the merits of what has already been stated by my colleague, but I will dwell a little on the structure of the law, that is to say, as perhaps already mentioned by someone, a law that presents itself as urgent to address what was the flood emergency, involves other initiatives in the articulation, which we - and above all I refer to the law of the extraordinary contribution to support the ""Cogne World Cup"" competition - see favorably and also other initiatives that could have a different dignity, be treated with a separate law. Why do we say this, especially with regard to Cogne? Because already previously, with other laws, we have behaved differently, I would dare to say jokingly that there is a sort of political bipolarism. We found ourselves discussing the contribution of sports clubs and it was addressed with a rule defined as urgent and so motivated by the Councilor for the urgency of registering for the competitions of an important championship. We addressed the issue of the contribution to the ""World Cup"" of La Thuile, which was also defined as urgent and addressed with an ad hoc rule. In that case the urgency was defined by the need to approve, even without the hearings requested by some colleagues, because there was the need to conclude the contract with Warner Bros I think for the issue of television filming. Even Cogne, which I consider a location worthy of attention, as was said by the speakers and by the Councilor himself in the hearing, could enjoy a separate rule. English: We believe that a modification of regional law 3, which can be defined as a consolidated text of sport, which concerns, as already mentioned, extraordinary contributions for sporting events, therefore also includes another regulation of sport that concerns contributions for major events, is appropriate and we could have arrived at it earlier, therefore treating everyone in the same way, this was not possible. If we had discussed an ad hoc regulation on the ""Cogne World Cup"", we could have brought our contribution, also through specific hearings, especially and even more so of those who are in favor of this intervention, which we do not allow ourselves to criticize, but we support. We allow ourselves to underline that by doing so we are proceeding at least apparently, Councilor, because I am sure that you have very clear ideas, in a disorderly manner. In the future, therefore, we ask you to arrive at this reform of sport as soon as possible, enclosing under a consolidated text all the regulations that concern interventions in favor of sport, not only the financial ones, but also other regulations. That said, we are substantially in favour of this article, for the other articles we will evaluate, as my Group Leader said, from time to time, however we would like to underline what was expressed in this speech so that it remains in the minutes and in the future we can verify whether our opinion has been taken into account."

47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,2,14022,"In reply to observations that have been brought in a somewhat disjointed manner during this morning's discussion, I note, in what have been some observations, a bit of approximation in the topics discussed and also a bit of poor punctuality and poor research of what has instead been a very clear path, which aims to provide answers, where they are useful, are possible, and are shared in their path, then more or less appreciated by those who must give judgments. In all honesty, however, I must say that the reconstruction developed by colleague Aggravi - made with great attention to detail - faithfully retraces the activities carried out during these months. I do not do this to annoy colleague Baccega, who smiles at these statements of mine, but because intellectual honesty, in my opinion, always needs to be underlined, even when not all situations have perhaps developed as expected. I believe that the important answers that are given within this budget variation, which is a budget variation that, for 95% of the financial resources put into question, corresponds to needs resulting from the flood phenomenon that hit us on June 29th and 30th... it is a budget variation that leads to the ratification of all those variations, including 21 million euros, that were activated immediately to provide answers to the population, through specific interventions carried out on the territory, thanks to the activity of the regional structures and the activities carried out on site by the Municipalities most affected by this phenomenon. Of those 21 million and some that were the object of these budget variations that we are ratifying today - and which was a path foreseen within the law that we approved a few months ago - these will be reimbursed, these yes in a manner already declared by the National Civil Protection, for approximately 20.6 million euros. The other 35 million total that are made available are resources that are made available by the Regional Administration and, for a part of these (relating to the interventions mainly to be identified in the 13.8 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Cogne, 4.4 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Valtournenche and 500 thousand euros mainly made available to the other Municipalities) a request will be made to the National Civil Protection which however does not yet have any type of coverage and for which there is still no type of certainty that the same will be refunded to the Regional Administration. Therefore this is, if we want to say, a provision of resources that, if they were to be included in the compensation and reimbursement account by the central Administration to the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, will be reused and reallocated in new and future interventions; if this were not the case, the Regional Administration would find itself next year having to implement those resources already assigned to local authorities to complete the work, to find additional resources that will have to be used to complete the initiatives to support the functional recovery of all activities - from roads to the technological networks affected - and it will be the subject of the next financial programming to develop and find this type of resources. This is one phase. The other phase is instead that of attention to the resources necessary to cover the material damage. In this sense, I also anticipate an assessment that, in my opinion, has escaped most people, and that is why I appreciated, in some ways, the analysis made by the minority colleague together with the illustration by colleague Malacrinò who punctually reported the resources allocated, chapter by chapter, on this type of intervention. The 3,900,000 euros allocated in Article 1 are essentially resources intended to compensate for the damages suffered, the material damages, by all the activities that were involved in the flood management and which are, as already underlined in other circumstances, intended for this by Law 5 (although improvable, although dated in some ways, a little more cumbersome) which we have even tried to streamline, accelerating the classic times of the end of the emergency, as classically set, and accelerating the possibility of making requests for financing and requests for support for the damages suffered - with a procedure that provides for the definitionone, through the appraisals, through the necessary procedures to then go to the disbursement - which will lead to a compensation, where those resources are sufficient, up to 70%. Where instead, in the face of a situation more important than these 3.9 million - and I will also respond to some exceptions from the Forza Italia group - net of what will be the compensations that will be evaluated based on the resources made available by the State Administration... they will complete that range of attention that the Regional Administration rightly must have for those who have suffered significant damage. On the other hand, the discussion of sharing is a discussion where the main lines of intervention have been made available on what should have been the attention to be paid to the structures, to the activities, that had not had the opportunity to work, due to the flood, in the month of July. The choice was careful, fought and also shared and brought to the table of the associations, where there were different requests, but where it was deemed (in a very transparent way, and also very seriously, in my opinion) to share a path where these resources were made available for a relaunch of the activities from a liquidity point of view. In certain cases, the situations that had occurred could lead to compensations - as we defined them - of a few thousand euros, which as a whole would not have moved the ranking of companies that perhaps have to plan the next winter activity, the next seasons and relaunch investments, and we decided to significantly support the possibility of self-financing, both to restart the activity and to create the conditions for having functional liquidity for the acquisition of stocks and so on. At the same time, and I am referring to the article on the Ski World Cup, we believed that we had to include in this bill some propulsive initiatives, initiatives that, starting from a critical situation, could give an envergure, a relaunch, to this ski resort: we did this by supporting, from a political point of view, the possibility of having the Ski World Cup in Cogne in the month of January, and to support it with a very pragmatic approach from the point of view of the use of financial resources, identifying, as the beneficiary body of this contribution, the Municipality of Cogne, not so much to diminish the importance of a World Cup in Cogne or to make it separate from the sporting world, but precisely to make immediately effective the need to intervene and to plan an event of this importance in a relatively short time, which is what separates us from today to the end of January. Other initiatives have then been introduced on the sidelines of natural disasters, which we all know well, and have gone to support the business world across the board, within which there is certainly a large part of the businesses also affected by the flood, with support for initiatives in favor of the Confidi, going to implement - and it has been underlined, and I thank those who have done so - the goodness of this path which, in recent years, in the last two years especially, has seen an increase in interest rates for those who have gotten into debt and this reimbursement in interest of the expenses incurred by our companies will in this way be compensated almost entirely compared to the law, which provides for reaching up to 75% reimbursement of the interests paid, and therefore 1,600,000 which brings the contribution in interest to the companies guaranteed by the Confidi to 4 and a half million euros. And again, the possibility - as I was saying - of having a particular attention to the territory through the Land Improvement Consortia in some situations that are worrying, from the point of view of urgency, for the districts involved but also for the seriousness of what the situations can be if they are not normalized and on which we do not intervene with a certain speed. To this, which is the universe of initiatives that, overall, count about 55 million euros of resources made available for the flood, some particularities have been added that are part, in a final part of the year, of those budget variations that are needed to give the most urgent answers to the needs expressed by the strfloods and the territory, so as to be able to close those interventions that are urgent regardless of whether there has been a flood or not; here we are talking about the Convitto Chabod or the swimming pool of Pré-Saint-Didier, where we can make comments and assessments of a broader nature and on which we may or may not agree, but which require a closure of the circle and an in-depth study has been done, the Councilor brought it to the attention of the Council Commission and I believe that this type of attention can then be partially exploited where one wants to do so, but I also believe that it is a timely response to a territory that for too long has not been served by a structure that has a very important specific weight. I will only enter into the merits, again, of an assessment, which is that relating to the Municipal Secretaries. I, if I were the one who raised this request in recent months, would be satisfied with the inclusion of this clarification, let's call it that; it was debated from a technical point of view, the competent Council Commission had wanted and also heard the General Secretary regarding a comprehensive examination of the uncertainties that the Agency of Secretaries had also expressed regarding the new formulations and the situation had been clarified in some ways. I believe that this type of intervention provides greater interpretative guarantees and greater clarity - just as requested by the opposition Councilors who had expressed this uncertainty over time - and I think that credit should also be given to these requests, to go and close a circle today. In that regard, I would like to anticipate what will also be the illustration, if we want to do it in more detail, of the amendment that we presented this morning and which goes, as shared in the Council Committee, to a principle with which a reservation is indicated, not so much to further complicate an article that has already been the subject of many changes in these weeks and months, but to support an intention - I seemed to have accepted it in those terms - of the Chamber and of the competent Commission at a time when there were two options on the table and we had proposed, within the norm, a path that was - if you like - more respectful and relevant to what were already national regulations in progress, but with the idea, where shared by the local authorities and by this Chamber, of inserting something more specific to the experience gained by the municipal secretaries in the last 5 years, and, in particular: ""Whoever had worked more than three years within the Municipalities, already acquiring a sort of familiarity with the activities to be carried out, could be considered a candidate for the post of secretary. carry out within our local authorities"". It is a path that, in my opinion, aims to clarify and also provide answers regarding what the effectiveness of the Secretaries (who are a focal point within our municipal administrations) could be and to provide 360-degree coverage of the needs to move forward with this call. I would stop here, thanking everyone for the discussion, also thanking for wanting to share the information, because in the path of sharing that has taken place in these months - net of doing it once a week, as someone said, or less - it is always very complex to be able to transmit, in a comprehensive and complete manner, every activity that is carried out on a daily basis. We tried to do it in compliance with a commitment made, but to work for the good of the activities that had to be done, and that are still to be done now, in wanting to signify shared visions within the Government, within the majority, and make them available as information and as a reason for evaluation by the opposition, who where they wanted to demonstrate their opposition or their agreement on this type of initiative were able to do so. Today is the time to have to give answers anyway, to close a circle, and this is a proposal that seems very balanced to us, which goes to give three answers, one to those who have suffered damages (and there will be a certification of these, there will be substantial coverage thanks to law 5), one to the municipal administrations, and, indirectly, one to the companies and communities that have been involved who will have the opportunity to work immediately, from December, utiusing the resources at their disposal to plan both the design part and the works part which will obviously be carried out in due time, as well as the activities to relaunch the activities on the territory, through the Ski World Cup but also through all those interventions dedicated to the territory with these 55 million made available mainly for the post-flood but not forgetting the other things which, as I was saying, had to be brought more urgently than other topics."

47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,4,2834,"As we have briefly summarized, we have already presented this agenda in the general discussion of the law, because to date the much discussed article 5 provides for provisions that go to grant loans and not compensation and we know that this was one of the issues debated on which a choice had to be made. I believe that our vision and our will have already been abundantly highlighted and I must tell you, President, that in your reply you made a passage that is a somewhat cryptic passage and perhaps you can clarify it, if you want, because you said that there was a round table discussion with the associations and that there were different opinions. I did not understand whether the round table discussion with the associations, which reported different opinions, was precisely on the nature of the support that the Region had to provide to businesses. This is why this agenda is here, but above all this agenda highlights a topic that you have not addressed - and I regret this, and I hope that, before the end of the discussion and the vote, you will also have the opportunity to clarify it - namely the issue of the failure to hear the associations that we have indicated, because, objectively, it has been raised by all the opposition colleagues, and I found it incomprehensible. If in your speech - I am trying to summarize, to extract something that can go in that direction - you wanted to subtly say that there were indeed different opinions on the nature of this support provided to businesses, then you knew it and you culpably avoided businesses coming to tell us what they thought, because you did not want them to leave on the record, on the record, an opinion that was contrary, perhaps negative, or more critical, otherwise it cannot be explained. The sentence with which the request for a hearing was dismissed, namely ""They are not relevant to the law"" cannot be explained; this is an objectively embarrassing thing, so it is evident that it is not acceptable. However, coming to the commitment and the agenda, as we have highlighted and as we have reported, with this agenda we ask - and even more so if you say that there is the possibility that the funds that have been put to cover, in advance of potential support and assistance from the national side... - if there will therefore be coverage from the national Government of these funds, if the resources will be freed up with which a measure can then be established. Even more so, with this agenda we ask and commit the regional Government to prepare a measure, with relative financial coverage, that recognizes adequate compensation to businesses and economic operators affected by the flood events of 29 and 30 June."

47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,6,4126,"I am happy to respond to this latest request from my colleague Manfrin, because there are topics where my colleague is very knowledgeable, others where his interventions are a bit more lacking. First of all, I would like to point out that within the discussion that took place - and in which I feel he has always participated - perhaps it is also my fault, that I did not express myself in the best way, but evaluations that arose from a discussion mainly with Adava, who has been the most active interlocutor in this process during these months, have been highlighted and made available, also to colleagues. The options that had been highlighted and brought to the table, where she was also sitting, offered two types of opportunities: one to intervene with compensation, as classically understood, with a percentage of compensation of around 20% compared to the lost revenue declared by the categories, which had been identified, broadly, at around 4 million, which would have led - and I mentioned it in my reply - to compensation (which would have in some cases contributed significantly and in some cases for a few thousand euros) for many companies that had had revenues lower than 40% compared to the average of previous years. Everything still had to be certified, everything had to be lined up and everything had to be put into a context that took into account on the one hand what could be the limitations dictated by state aid, and on the other the actual reporting and bureaucracy that had to be developed in order to arrive at these reimbursements. The evaluation that had been proposed, and was proposed at the table, to which then no one said yes or no, rightly so, because then it becomes easier to perhaps go and criticize a choice that must somehow be made and say: ""No, but I preferred the other one"" ... very well, in the meantime we put one on the table and we think we can do it in the best way to provide answers, therefore we evaluated going towards a choice that could be more coherent and more positive also for those who suffered damages and for those who needed to relaunch their business, going to support them with an amount (in some ways even higher than what the individual reimbursements would have been) that however could have given all companies the possibility of supplying themselves in an appropriate manner to relaunch their season, to relaunch their work over time, making most of the resources available for a restructuring of the services that are part of the possibility of hosting new people, for initiatives such as the World Cup to relaunch the territory. I would also like to underline the commitment that there was on the part of the competent Councilor in a negotiation - that's what I call it - in a very close comparison also with the competent Ministry, which we will then talk about in the second of the two proposals on the agenda, where the Councilor and the Piedmontese Councilor have evaluated the possibility of including, where possible, also compensation in addition to reimbursements for material damage suffered, because in the Piedmontese territory, there were no structures with damage, so we collaborated to find a path that could give the two opportunities also to our territory, and I think that - net of the fact that someone is not happy and would have perhaps preferred something different - we did a careful job and with the will to give the answer that we believe is best for this type of intervention. We did it in concert and also by comparing ourselves with the associations during the process, as we had also anticipated to you; on this aspect I think that the willingness, also on the part of Finaosta, to make available a product that can be appreciated, very streamlined and very quick to set up and activate for those who need it is an important example. Therefore, with regard to your agenda, we will abstain for the reasons we have expressed."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,7,117,Other groups that want to join the discussion? I don't see any other requests. Councilor Manfrin has the authority.
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,8,5334,"Thank you, Mr President, for your kind reply, I also thank you for your opinion on my abilities, I appreciate it in a particular way, I am sure that instead you, accustomed to covering all roles, have developed exceptional capacities of understanding on all the themes of human knowledge and you demonstrate it daily, and we thank you for this and we thank Providence for having placed you in that position because otherwise we would have unfortunately had a serious shortage in the Aosta Valley, instead we certainly have a person who understands everything in the right place, at the right time, and for this we thank you. Net of this, you were very clever to say something like this: the choice is this because the way it was designed, that is, the way you had thought of it, therefore the percentage of lost revenue, the percentage of compensation, what came in, what was given, that is, the model that you had created was not good, and since the compensation model that you had created was not good, then that is not a viable path. President, but it doesn't work like that, it doesn't work like that at all! There are two ways, at least we said it and she admitted it too: there is the way you have taken of loans, and we will see - we have expressed an opinion - we will see how many people will resort to these loans, especially since, as we also underlined in the text, the winter season has already begun and there is still no possibility of adhering to these loans, so we will see how many will adhere to them, but above all we will see what the effect will be and what the draw will be on the measure, especially for those who have been in particular difficulty, because I put myself in the shoes of a structure that has suffered damage and clearly has to deal with it and does not have the liquidity to do so, takes loans that will then have to be returned and therefore will worsen its hole. This is a method that we will verify. He said, however, and I am happy, that there are two paths: there is the path of loans that you have taken, on which I also want to reiterate that it is not that we were given the opportunity to choose in the meetings, because we said so, we were simply informed, we arrived there and were told: ""We thought of doing this, we thought of doing that, things are like this, things are like that"", not ""Which path do you want to take? But do you think it is like this or that?"", we asked it several times, if you remember: ""Are there alternatives to this proposal, to this model, to this article?"", ""No, it is like this, we are giving it to you so you can read it"". It is not the fact of being seated at the table and being informed of what was happening that makes us in some way complicit; we have taken note of it and we have told him clearly, I think that transparency is absolutely impeccable on our part. She said she was happy to answer but in reality she didn't answer, or rather, she answered as she usually does, in her omniscience, that is, not to say: ""Well, yes, we prevented the debate because we were afraid that someone would come to the Commission to say: we don't want this measure, we don't want this proposal"", it would have been more honest instead of giving the President of the Second Commission the mandate to interrupt the hearings, it would have been more honest. ""We don't want criticism, we know everything, we have infused science, we don't want criticism"". Instead, no, but as she usually does, she says in her answer that ""Net of someone's dissatisfaction"", so one could read that someone is not satisfied, but what percentage of the activities does this ""Someone"" add up to? Because she spoke mainly of Adava, but we listed two other categories, Confcommercio and Confesercenti. Were these categories asked what they thought? Because we did, we asked them, and these categories didn't even see the text. We simply didn't want to have a biased opinion from one side to the other, someone preferred to say: ""You know what? No, we don't do hearings because ""it's like this and it's like that"" and they are not relevant to the law"". We take note, we will obviously communicate to the companies and trade associations that they are no longer companies, they should not be defined as such, because the article that establishes this possibility obviously does not include them. I'll tell you the truth,there was an idea for a moment, that is, to present an amendment that removed the word ""Enterprises"" from the article, because it is not relevant and therefore it was fine as it is. It would have been a provocation and perhaps it would have added something to the debate, but we believe that this is in itself evident, in reality, even in your response. It is therefore evident that you have made a choice, we legitimately propose another, then we will vote as we do in a democracy and we will see the result at the end and everyone, inside and outside this Chamber, will be able to know what one thinks and what the other thinks in a democratic way. It would have been nicer to also have people's ideas, but you are a bit allergic to criticism. All right, agreed, we will see how many you will collect between now and the end of the legislature."

47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,10,7267,"We too, as a Forza Italia group, illustrate the agenda that we presented regarding compensation following the damage suffered by the flood of 29 and 30 June. It is essentially a re-proposal of the agenda that we presented in the context of the discussion of the DEFR 2025-2027, in relation to the support for economic operators who are not affected by the compensation provided by the State. We believe that, in a perspective of collaboration between the State and the Region, it is necessary to address the issue within the context of complementarity of action and at an integrative level, as is done by the Region in many situations, I am referring, for example, to what we have already seen in the past in the context of initiatives in the world of work, training, where the State makes funds available in one sector and the Region makes funds available in the other, to provide complete coverage of the needs that exist in the territory. In this case, we must underline the constructive collaborative relationship with the center-right central government that has shown, in this circumstance and in others, to have a great consideration for our region. I would like to begin, in the introduction, from the first inspection that took place in Aosta, the meeting of July 2, with the Minister of Tourism, where the availability of a series of support aids for compensation was announced for economic operators, who are the responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism: 10 million had been announced, today 15 million were decreed together with Piedmont but I believe that the given word was kept, with the decree that was approved on November 11. After that there was the inspection in the Valley and the great attention that was shown by the Minister of Public Administration and the Minister of Civil Protection who came to realize: the Ministry of Civil Protection has made available, following the decree of the State of Emergency, 20.6 million euros to deal with the difficulties. The Region has done its part and I believe that the opening of the road after 27 days of isolation has been noted with satisfaction, an important job has been done to which all the regional structures have given their contribution. In terms of the approach that there has been to this budget variation, we had said in the illustration in the intervention of the general discussion, my colleague who spoke after me repeated it, that we would have shared articles 1 to 7 and instead, as regards the attitude on the overall vote of the provision, it would also have been in consideration of what would have been the behavior on this agenda by the regional Government. We have not made any confusion, we are very clear and we believe that the Region, for our way of seeing and solving this problem, should intervene to complement what the State has done, in the context of the activities that are excluded from the benefits that are financed by the Ministry of the Interior, because in recent days we have also seen in the press that someone says that it is a shame that bars are not included, so it means that they were a need, because, if the State had made money available, they would have been useful for these categories, not as is being said now that perhaps there was no need, because someone perhaps gets 1,000 euros rather than 1,500, rather than 500 euros and that it is an evaluation of an insignificant benefit. For us it is significant, so we believe that it would have been correct for all economic operators to have had the same approach from the public administration, but an integrative approach to what the State has set up, because we cannot always think of delegating everything to the State, we also have management responsibilities and therefore I believe that, like in a family, everyone must do their part: everyone makes available what they can make at the moment to deal with the difficult situation. I believe that the allocation we have received from the State is important but if the State has provided for it within the categories included by the Ministry of Tourism, I believe that it would have been up to us to go and see which categories are excluded and intervene with the same methods on that type of activity. This is whatwhat we are asking for with this motion, nothing more; it seems very simple but also very reasonable as a proposal. We cannot understand the reason, the ratio why it cannot be accepted. Among other things, it seems to me that on the issue of compensation for indirect damages, the categories have claimed it and requested it, so either the categories do not have a clear picture of the situation, or there is something that does not add up in the approach. We will support the measure in Article 5, but it is a completely different measure, which provides an answer not to the need for compensation, it gives the possibility of opening loans, but they are two completely distinct things. We will vote for Article 5, but we ask to be able to go in this direction. To the colleagues in the opposition who said that perhaps this is the presentation of the motion, it was also an opportunity to clarify in order to eliminate their own confusion, in the sense of approaching this initiative; I say that perhaps we are the ones who have some confusion lately because we no longer know what the positions are in this Chamber. We are increasingly aware of this and it would be important to understand what the real positions are between now and the budget because we will not find ourselves dealing with a partial matter like this, but we will have to manage, in about ten or fifteen days, the budget of the Valle d'Aosta Region. Our spirit is a very clear spirit, everyone knows what our position is, a central position of Forza Italia in the center-right, we do not understand instead what the self-definitions are of placing ourselves geometrically somewhere. We believe that the center corresponds to a representation that is not geographical, but of values, so we are waiting for the evolutions that will have to happen, but we believe we should send back to the sender observations that are purely instrumental and that also seek to fuel political discord within the center-right. The center-right is a project, which is at an advanced stage because we are working together, it is nice that the League has also had a path of maturation because at the time of the DEFR the initiative we presented on compensation had not been supported, today instead it has shared this spirit, therefore it will no longer be only us of Forza Italia to represent this need of the Aosta Valley people but the number of sharing in the chamber will grow. For our part, the construction site is an advanced construction site, it is not a construction site still in the planning or design phase, therefore, to those who allow themselves to make evaluations inside the house of others, we wish to have the same success, to be able to put together the energies and forces that presuppose being able to put together."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,11,66,"For the Government, the President of the Region to whom I pass the floor."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,12,2940,"I will answer in this first line, and then leave room for my colleague Grosjacques regarding the more technical aspects relating to compensation from the State. I will answer you in a very simple way. Perhaps, driven by this political positioning, some aspect of the Legislative Decree has been lost that should have been analyzed in a more in-depth manner, as other colleagues have done and have tried to bring back to the Chamber. The first article, which is an article that goes to finance law 5, is an article that will guarantee compensation to those who have suffered damage in the territory. The procedure of law 5, the 3,900,000 euros of resources; it seems to me that article 1 will finance what will be the requests that have been put forward, moreover without the indication of an Ateco code or anything else, because law 5 does not provide for this type of development. Precisely in the context of what you say, these resources are made available to cover companies that will not be affected by the national decree, since, just to add one element, those who will join the national contribution will not have to have other subsidies, from other bodies or other public resources, to complete it. It goes without saying that the answer to your question is already within the Legislative Decree, that is, those resources there - which then are not sufficient or there are too many and which will have to be remodeled, increased, evaluated in a possible future bill... -, are already present and are there specifically to provide a response of reimbursement of up to 70% for those companies that have suffered material damage; those that will clearly be excluded and will not be contemplated within the national path that provides for the 15 million in reimbursements for the material damage suffered (therefore all those situations that will need to be reimbursed for the interventions that they had to do) will find an answer within law 5 with this first allocation that, if it is not sufficient, will be implemented, but which will guarantee a 70% reimbursement. This is the path that had already been adopted in 2000 with the flood, which provided coverage for the damages transversally suffered on the territory and which, also in this circumstance, with a speeding up, if we want, also of the law, because the law itself - I said it before but perhaps it escaped - should see, before being able to draw up the beneficiaries, the closure of the emergency path, which instead in this case is bypassed and, downstream of what will be the resources made available by the State, will see the formalization of who will be able to access the regional benefits; these are resources that are already available right away and will be made available to those people who have not had compensation at a national level. From this point of view, therefore, I feel authorized to say that the availability is already there and is already acknowledged within this bill."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,13,53,"Councilor Marquis has booked, he has the right to do so."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,14,1214,"Mr President, perhaps we have a misunderstanding, Article 1 covers direct material damage, the decree of the Ministry of Tourism also covers indirect damage and we are talking about this, so I don't know if we can't understand. It's very simple, you tell us something to divert the reasoning. The discussion is only and exclusively on indirect damages which are called lost profits, because material damages are one thing and Article 1 does not include indirect damages. So I am telling you that there is unfair behavior on the part of the public administration in its relations with economic operators, because there are economic operators who will receive compensation for direct and indirect damages and there are economic operators who, because the Region does not put money into indirect damages, will only receive recognition for direct damages. We must not sit here and kid ourselves, because this is the truth, because misunderstanding this means kidding ourselves, because the order of the day, to put it very clearly, has this objective, to recognize the indirect damages, what the associations to which you did not want to give answers are asking. Everything else is nonsense."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,15,51,"Councillor Grosjacques for the group, has the power."
47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962,M,UV,16,7037,"With reference to the agenda, if colleague Marquis agrees, I would also go into a little more detail about question time, given that the premises are exactly superimposable, so given the limited time for question time, perhaps we will delve a little deeper into the path that led to the issuing of the decree of the Ministry of Tourism. In the meantime, as a premise, you will not lead us to say that the Ministry and the Government have not done their part, also because I would like to thank the structures of the Ministry for what they have done and above all for the discussions we have had, which have been continuous and constant; however, I believe it is important to summarize some passages, because you conclude the agenda by saying to prepare a compensation measure to cover the Ateco codes not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. Then I will get to, making the excursus, telling you that those who were kept out were not kept out because they were not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, but were kept out for a choice related to resources, as stated by the general director. In your questions, you ask if the perimeter of the Ateco codes of the decree was known. We began our discussions, starting from the day after the visit of Minister Santanchè on July 2; the minister (and this is worth underlining, even if the President has already made a point on this) following the commitment of the 10 million - which then became 10 for two Regions and then became 15 due to the discussions between the Valle d'Aosta Region and the Piedmont Region and the Minister himself - had categorically excluded compensation for lost profits. The decree should have only and exclusively concerned material damages and this emerges from a whole series of correspondence between the structures of the Department and the Ministry. The Ministry, following the video conference of September 10, where the issues related to the contents of the decree were explored in depth, had sent a list of Ateco codes to identify the economic activities to which the ministerial resources could be allocated. In this email, for example, other sports activities were included: at our express request we had reported some structures and infrastructures, first and foremost the Breuil Golf Club, which had been seriously damaged by the flood and which were initially included in the email from the Ministry. We had not found the Ateco code 56.30 which concerned bars and we, as for other categories, wrote on several occasions asking to include these categories too because they had been damaged, and they are not outside the jurisdiction, because outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Tourism were commercial activities on which we did work that did not lead to the same results, unfortunately, with the Ministry of Made in Italy businesses. The Ministry had included, contrary to the first draft, also a series of activities expressly requested by us, such as the rental of sports equipment, which we know has suffered considerable damage in Breuil Cervinia, and ski schools; the decree was not submitted to us in draft form because - the explanation, I believe legitimate, of the Ministry was this - since it had been sent to the Ministry of Economy and the Court of Auditors for the relevant approval, it could have been subject to comments that would have subsequently given rise to changes - therefore the Region never saw the draft decree, except after its definitive publication on November 11, as you recalled. As regards the nature of the compensation, in the video conference held on October 16 in the presence of the Minister and Councilor Chiarelli (my counterpart, for the Piedmont Region), the Minister expressly asked to allow the allocation of resources for compensation for lost profits, since the Municipalities included in the Civil Protection ordinance of the Piedmont Region would have practically not had any type of compensation since no material damage had occurred, except in some specific situations. We therefore agreed and gave our consent so that the Minister could, on the basis of the agreement between the two Regions, follow up on the signing and subsequent publication of the decree. As regards the competence of the Ministry's matters, some assessments have been made here.actions saying: ""You asked for things that were not within your jurisdiction""; it is not true, because, if you read - as I imagine you did - carefully the Ateco codes, you found canteens or itinerant pastry shops or in any case restaurants, therefore catering activities, activities that are usually managed by the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy, therefore this decree could have easily included bars as well. I say this because in the video conference of November 15, therefore last Friday, in the presence - I want to underline this - of all the business categories included in the decree, the general director of productive activities of the Ministry, at the express request - and I add that at the request of the Ministry the video conference that lasted an hour and a half was recorded, therefore you will certainly be able to obtain it through your channels - said that bars were excluded due to a ministerial choice linked to the available resources, so I believe that from this point of view all the work that needed to be done has been done. The traders were absolutely taken into consideration, because the undersigned had several discussions with the Chief of Cabinet of Minister Urso, but the only measure available to the Ministry of Enterprise was the one related to the reduction of rates for those who wanted a measure similar to the one that was set up in the budget variation: the Mediocredito centrale would have reduced the rates, but there was no type of compensation provided by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy. This is to say that we also carefully followed those who we knew would be excluded from this decree. I am closing because I have no more time but I would like to say, colleague, that you have highlighted a whole series of passages, but it seems to me that your activity, despite being government forces at a national level, is a bit like chasing after things that have already come out rather than having - and you have - the possibility of interacting, because I have heard you say on several occasions that you have telephone contacts with all the Ministers of this Government, you have said it on several occasions, so what I want to underline is that you could have intervened heavily on this decree, instead we did everything that had to be done and to hear today from national government forces that the decree is lacking and above all to hear that there are activities that have not been included..."

Councillor, I have listened carefully to your reconstruction, we are pleased that you have maintained continuous relations with the competent Ministry. From what we understand, everything possible has been done by the Ministry to make the group of beneficiaries as broad as possible, so we have a different result than what you announced, that is, that it was possible, in your opinion, to extend the benefit to some categories that are excluded in the category of economic operators; as far as we are concerned, we believe we are satisfied with the work that has been done at central level, we recognise it, we were pleased that you also recognised that there has been good collaboration, but it is precisely for this reason that we believed and believe, as I said earlier, that, in the context of a collaboration between bodies, between different institutional levels, when an approach is established, the measures at our regional level are integrated and made complementary.

Probably some piece was lost when, in the discussion on the DEFR, all the opposition groups remembered that it had been somewhat agreed to wait for the articles, therefore to be able to examine the articles, to then be able to formulate their own position. So we did, as we had agreed, we waited to see what the articles were and obviously I will not hide the surprise of having seen the articles that should have been the emergency one loaded with a whole series of articles that concerned the universe of the world; so in something that we expected to be exclusively dedicated to the flood, instead, it is loaded with a bit of everything, but once we saw what was expected and once we also examined and listened to the opinion of the stakeholders, which we had highlighted we would have been happy to hear in the Commission, but it was not possible by virtue of the censorship applied by the President of the II Commission on the mandate obviously of the President of the Region, so in the face of this censorship, we have matured our position which was already rather clear, but we have had a confirmation. We have therefore presented with conviction and also with absolute support our proposal regarding the compensation and we will also vote with conviction on the proposal made by our colleagues from Forza Italia."

47987,XVI,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,23,3655,"Simply to express a consideration and then also the voting position. I think that the debate we have heard has been useful, although the information at our disposal is certainly partial, it is not at the level of either the Assessor or colleague Marquis, so in spirit, as we wanted to give support to the agenda of our colleagues from the League, we will also vote on this agenda. However, I would like to make a clarification: I know that colleague Marquis is much more knowledgeable in geometry than I am, but politics is often algebra and not geometry. What I said this morning... actually, I also thank my colleague Baccega for having awarded me a title that I am not worthy of, but I thank him anyway, I tend to make a very simple consideration: I did not say that you were confused and I did not even say that the centre-right is confused, I said that I was the one who was confused, because finding myself with two orders of the day, however with a non-trivial peculiarity, because I have to tell you the truth, colleague Marquis, while the order of the day of my colleagues from the League keeps the meshes open for every possible eventual application to include those who have been forgotten, you make two passages that, in my opinion, have generated confusion. On the one hand, essentially, it asks to intervene where - and, I repeat, I agree with Councillor Grosjacques - the Ministry, or in any case the Government that you support at the Roman level, has not intervened and therefore I say to myself: ""Why don't you carry out an operation of moral suasion to try to find not so much the issue of money but the ways to be able to intervene anyway?"", because the choice in any case depends mainly on Rome rather than Aosta; on the other hand, objectively, I expected only one order of the day, given that this choice was made in this place, because - I'm referring to what my colleague Manfrin said - in the previous place I remember very well that under the DEFR, rightly, all the opposition forces, without the need to connect them with red, blue or green wires, were essentially a little taken aback by the presentation of your order of the day, for one reason: in that place there was still a communion of intent, and we know that the term communion is complex, because everyone has to agree, and there we found ourselves a little taken aback. In this place therefore - it's my confusion, I repeat, you will surely have clear ideas - like a battleship you are heading towards the Dardanelles and I am happy for you, but the confusion was mine, because if I had to choose who to support, in the end I have to understand if they are saying the same thing, if they are saying two different things. The support is a support on principle, on will, also on effort, but objectively, from what I heard from the Councilor, the commitment is perhaps not entirely... or in any case what happened, or rather, even some premise, perhaps it is not entirely consistent with the path but, I repeat, we have information that is certainly partial, so it is you who must then give an explanation of what happened, and I say ""You"" in a broad sense. I did not call others confused, I was the confused one, because when you find these orders of the day, you rightly say: ""Let me understand what the position is"", considering that à maintes reprises, as I said, it is said that you are united for better or for worse, and no one wants to divide you, for goodness sake, you already do enough on your own in some things. Having said that, I repeat, in principle we will vote for it even if, in light of what we have heard, there are many doubts."

We will vote on this motion because in principle what has been proposed is absolutely correct, of course what Councilor Grosjacques said would dismantle a bit the castle built by Councilor Marquis; I know very well that outside there is also someone who is an authoritative spokesperson for Minister Santanchè who usually listens to us and surely we will soon read on his pages the very direct position of the person who certainly has the greatest contacts with the Minister, so from this point of view we will vote on the motion with the doubts that we have somehow expressed in this declaration of vote."

I would also like to make some considerations in light of the President's reply, because when he highlights that he agrees with or appreciates the report by Councillor Aggravi... I would like to highlight that in that report there are all the points of agreement that have been expressed by all the other group leaders, therefore a lack of agreement on the measure, the hearings denied in the Commission, the resources covered by national funds, the inclusion of articles that had no relevance to the emergency and even, with respect to the question of the Secretaries, the Councillor himself also referred to the considerations that I brought up during the general discussion to say that he fully agreed with what I had said. This time too I don't understand if it is linked to the way in which the various thoughts are expressed or if it is linked to the variable geometries that we hear so much about these days. Honestly, from this point of view, as the President has announced to us, surely the document that we will vote on in the next Regional Council will perhaps define the framework even better, but I repeat that I will go back and review what was said, but having also shared his minority report with my colleague, I can say that in some way I shared his and he shared mine, because the things we said are the same. As I was saying, it's a shame, we could have had a unanimous vote, most likely on those articles that concerned the emergency. That was not what they wanted to do and therefore we will abstain."

From these discussions, some observations were born that we had the opportunity to present to the III Council Commission, heard by President Chatrian in the III Commission on 19 December 2023 and after this hearing, we proceeded with notification no. 4 to the European Commission. This notification was then approved by the European Community with its own decision on 30 September 2024 and therefore today we find ourselves having to actually ratify the modification of this CSR based on the discussions that we have already had throughout the year. In addition, with respect to the changes that we agreed upon and discussed in December with the Council Commission, we have a 1% reduction in the FEASR quota - established in agreement with the Ministry, to provide a response of solidarity with respect to the floods that have hit the agricultural sector in Emilia Romagna in particular - and an increase in organic premiums of 10 euros on meadows and 5 euros on pastures to also include certification costs. This was a request that the trade associations and representatives had made: ""Include certification costs in the costs""; it was decided, through all discussions, to increase the quotas by these euros (precisely to provide this type of response) and to actually include certification costs."

It is the new reference of the common agricultural policy, a set of rules to support the agricultural and forestry sectors for rural areas, it is the founding reference in Italy to the national strategic plan, shared with all the Regions, the resources are for us about 92 million for the 5 years, with State-Region and ERDF shares. It contains all the forms of support, in particular those related to disadvantaged areas, to the compensatory payment for Natura 2000 agricultural areas and for animal welfare, for us very important and necessary compared to other realities of the Po Valley. With today's approval, real support is implemented for the agricultural world - certainly not easy to apply, we are clearly convinced of this - but which requires a temporal application effort that requires understanding the system and changes to the management of companies, changes that are not always immediate and adaptable, but these new formulas indicate new paths for production and less impactful management, with choices aimed at organic, in particular with forage production. A great deal of work has been done by the trade association, by freelancers, by the offices of the Department and by the Aosta Valley Area, to make companies adopt the binding changes, thinking about the new systems of agricultural production and management. We once had privileged environmental conditions on our side and today, year after year, we must be able to grasp the changes and constantly shape the entrepreneurial management of the climate and the trend of the market, not only local. The future hope for the sector is a conscious adhesion, already started with the knowledge of the detailed conditions, but not impossible; they are opportunities proposed as in the past, with constant and punctual payments, hoping that the Aosta Valley is always among the first places and, if not in first place, as has happened in the past, for the advancement of the expenditure of regular and punctual payments, with the collection of the measures, the hope is for everyone by the end of the year. For the companies, who have earned it, a Christmas bonus, not indifferent for the payments of rent, staff and mortgages with installments due. Furthermore, it is worth remembering once again the commitment made by the primary actors, namely the Department, with its structures and offices, the Area and the Agea, the trade associations, the cooperative system and, finally, the individual business owners or entrepreneurs, ready and aware in seizing the opportunities of the complement to be approved today.

I would like to point out that behind the word ""Agriculture"", we must not forget the entire territory, because today we have a document here and I hope that all the meetings that have been held in the territory have been acknowledged, as Councilor Carrel mentioned; I had participated not in all but in some of these meetings where all the problems and all those particularities were underlined that perhaps do not have an entrepreneurial spirit but have a very important aspect with regards to the maintenance of the territory. I hope that with this document we will meet all these requests that have been brought forward by the territory. We, as a group of Rassemblement Valdôtain, had already, reluctantly, abstained last March from approving this document, because in our opinion it did not provide concrete answers especially for these small realities, for many small realities that today maintain the territory without taking into account the economic aspect, but only for pure maintenance and tradition of the territory, with the aim of having a panorama not only agricultural, but also for the tourist aspect, that gives a different impression because, as we all know, having a well-kept territory is very important also for the tourist aspect, and I do not need to underline this. What can I say? We really learn and we hope with good luck, that this document provides an answer to the territory, to the small realities and so on. As we abstained with the other document, we will abstain, but we will work constructively to be able to provide greater resources in every sense, to be able to have a document and give answers to the territory that really go to see those small realities that today are often forgotten, but that give a very important contribution to the maintenance of the territory, to combat fires, floods and everything else that unfortunately today the European directives - they are very good, they are very important and they are basic - perhaps, with a territory like ours, when it comes to agriculture, do not affect enough with regards to the aspects of our territory. I hope that with law 17 and with other measures we will intervene in favor of these to ensure that we give more detailed and more targeted answers possibly to all these particularities, so that they continue to maintain our territory as it has always been maintained, as we inherited it from our ancestors."

47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,2,16752,"This bill deals with urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities. The Aosta Valley is considered a mountain region in its entirety; on the maps we study at school the percentage of mountains is 100%. We, if we are objective, and above all grown up compared to when we went to school, do not consider this aspect true, or at least not in its entirety. There are municipalities, or at least parts of them, that to define as mountainous is a real insult to those who really know what the mountains are and live there all year round. We must be the first to stop defining ourselves entirely as mountainous if we want to give justice to those who really live in the mountains. Depopulation affects almost everyone in the Aosta Valley, except the municipalities of the Plaine, where instead there is a general increase in population. But the difference, and this is the meaning of the law, is that the depopulation that affects small municipalities puts their existence at risk. Losing 100 people in Châtillon is certainly serious, losing 10 in Rhêmes-Notre-Dame is much more serious. Social and economic life is at stake, volunteering is at stake - just think of the Pro Loco, the volunteer firefighters, the Alpini - and politics is at stake, now we always see the same people running for office, if indeed these people are still found. And I want to emphasize this: Municipalities that today no longer have a sufficient critical mass of population to guarantee a life for the community are Municipalities destined to have no future, they are destined to die, because that is what it is about, and how can even a young person invest in a Municipality that has no future? We often make the mistake of looking at the increase and decrease in population in the last ten years alone, obviously these data must be taken into account, but above all we must analyze the trend in recent decades. Emile Chanoux already said in the 1920s: ""I am originally from a country in the Aosta Valley where the depopulation is the most devastating. I can see the powerful sadness of this old country"". In fact, it is from the Unification of Italy that the depopulation of many of our small municipalities and of many upper hamlets of large municipalities began, the data from the various censuses demonstrate this and these are easily found on the Istat website. If we analyze this trend in recent decades, the numbers are merciless, let's take some examples, precisely, starting from the Unification of Italy. In 1861 Allein had 770 inhabitants, now 207; Chamois 322, now 107; Emarèse 495, now 217; Etroubles 1,032, now 478; La Magdeleine 386, now 100; Pontboset 708, now 174; Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 777, now 164; Valsavarenche 639, now 161. These are just a few examples. A phenomenon, as I said, that has distant roots; not simple solutions, but those proposed in the law could be some of these. This proposal in fact addresses one of the aspects that could reverse the phenomenon of depopulation: the fact that living in the mountains costs more and therefore contributions are necessary, and above all tax relief. A proposal that has never claimed to be the solution to the problem, but a proposal that must be, together with others, one of the pieces of the puzzle, a proposal that can allow those who live in the mountains to stay there and those who want to return. Someone might argue that rather than benefits for individuals and families, we need to guarantee services - and I totally agree - but guaranteeing services must go hand in hand with direct economic aid to families and those who want to invest in these small territories. Without people, services cannot be guaranteed, without services, the presence of people cannot be guaranteed. These two issues must go hand in hand. The current results of depopulation demonstrate two aspects: either that the measures adopted to date are not sufficient or that these measures are wrong, because otherwise we would not be here talking about a law against depopulation. At the heart of this proposal is also the cultural aspect, an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is in fact an Aosta Valley in which autonomy no longer makes sense, because this land would become, like many other territories, without specificity; an urban and urbanized Aosta Valley is an ""Italian Aosta Valley in all respects"" and we must resist this in any way, in the name of those who have wantedluto the specificities that we enjoy today. And here is the linguistic, cultural aspect, of symbiosis with the high lands to be reinvigorated: it is in fact foreseen, for those who decide to return to live in the mountain municipalities, the need to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language and culture, Titsch and Töitschu and Walser culture in the Walser municipalities, as well as a communication campaign of the measures of the law in the French-speaking states and in the German-speaking states only for the Walser communities, because the aim would be to attract new inhabitants from other states, with the aim of changing their lives. And, if you will notice, in the financial coverage of article 4, for the contribution for new residents, the Chéque Montagnard, the amount is absolutely prudent and in perspective, as it is truly a lifestyle choice that requires time in the decision. A real, concrete, improvable proposal, as I have said from day one. A non-trivial articulated that I will now explore in greater depth. Article 1, paragraph 1, states the purpose and object of this proposed law, recalls Articles 31, 37, first paragraph, and 44, second paragraph, of the Constitution. In order to counteract the demographic decline of small mountain municipalities, a measure for the birth rate and a contribution for the inclusion of new residents in small mountain municipalities is promoted, enhancing the linguistic and cultural particularism of local communities. Paragraph 2 guarantees an exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge in order to provide support to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. Article 2, paragraph 1, defines which are small mountain municipalities, i.e. those that on 31 December 2023 have a population of less than 800 inhabitants and where the seat of their municipality is above 650 meters above sea level. Paragraph 2 establishes that the Regional Council, within thirty days of the entry into force of the law, approves the list of municipalities that present the characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 and updates it every three years. Some clarifications are necessary: ​​it is quite clear that finding an objective classification is practically impossible, because there are truly so many aspects that define what a mountain is and what a small municipality is. However, the two indicators identified seemed to be the best for including small, mountainous and not strictly tourist municipalities. In the initial reasoning for the law, the objective was also to include the mountain villages of large municipalities, which must absolutely not be second-rate and which, in many cases, are in the same conditions as small municipalities identified by the law. However, after a passage from Dr. Ceccarelli, head of the Economic and Social Observatory, it emerged that to date there are no disaggregated data on residents by fraction in the hands of the Region, so to date it is impossible to quantify any possible burden deriving from the application of the measures of the law in parts of municipalities, but it is obvious that, in perspective, this data will have to be there and, if there were a law, there will have to be this implementation. Article 3, paragraph 1, establishes the Chèque Valdôtain birth allowance, as a measure aimed at encouraging an increase in births and the valorization of parenthood in small mountain municipalities. Paragraph 2 highlights that the allowance is paid for twelve months, up to a maximum of 5 thousand euros per year in favor of families at the time of the birth of a child and until the child reaches the age of three, or the entry into the family of a minor, through adoption or foster care, up to the age of three. It is then expected that the beneficiaries of the birth allowance are parents residing in a small mountain municipality of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, or who transfer their residence to one of the said municipalities and who receive a total income determined for the purposes of personal income tax of up to 50 thousand euros. A sum that is certainly not trivial, but which serves to provide assistance to the middle class, not only to the less well-off. Paragraph 4 emphasizes that residency in the small mountain town must be maintained for at least ten years, under penalty of forfeiture of the birth allowance and the return of the sums received. Ten years is not a trivial number at all, but it is precisely because it is necessary in the basic seriousness to undertake this type of life choices that this number was chosen. Article 4,paragraph 1, establishes an incentive for new residents in small mountain municipalities, the Chèque Montagnard. A financial contribution of 5 thousand euros per year is provided for a three-year period for families who transfer their residence to a small mountain municipality in the Region and maintain it for at least 10 years. Paragraph 2 includes the requirements that the members of the family unit must possess: be Italian citizens or citizens of a member state of the European Union, or stateless persons or foreigners with a regular residence permit; earn a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and at least two members of the family unit must be under 70 years of age on the date of request for the contribution, because in any case it would make no sense to encourage the arrival of pensioners who could certainly give less value to small municipalities in the long term. Paragraph 3 states that, for those who already reside in the regional territory, in order to move and have access to the contribution, the Municipality of origin must have a population of no less than 3 thousand inhabitants as of December 31, 2023, because obviously residents must not be stolen from small Municipalities or in any case Municipalities of not so large dimensions within the Valley. Paragraph 4 establishes that in order to have access to the contribution, the requesting family unit must declare and demonstrate that the property located in the Municipality of new residence (whether it is owned or deriving from a loan for use rental contract or other equivalent title) is intended as a habitual residence for the entire period of enjoyment of the benefit. Paragraph 5 emphasizes that the amount of the contribution referred to in Paragraph 1 is doubled if the requesting family units start a business activity in the small mountain municipality of their new residence, including through the recovery of real estate assets of the historical and artistic heritage, while paragraph 6 emphasizes that the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 can be combined with the birth allowance referred to in Article 3. The cultural and linguistic aspect, with a view to integration into the local community, is central in paragraph 7, in fact, for the purposes of obtaining the contribution, all members of the family unit aged between 7 and 69 years of age, who are not affected by disabilities, pursuant to the provisions in force, must attend, within the first two years of transferring their residence to a small mountain municipality, a course in Franco-Provençal and Franco-Provençal culture, in Töitschu and Titsch of Walser culture in the Municipality of Issime/Eischeme and Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. Paragraph 8 specifies that the Regional Council, within 60 days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, identifies the methods of organizing the course of that paragraph 7, including the bodies and associations authorized to teach. It is essential on the one hand to integrate and on the other to strongly stimulate the population that already resides in a small municipality of the importance of their languages ​​and cultures. Article 5, paragraph 1, establishes that the Regional Council, within sixty days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, regulates the criteria and methods of assigning the birth allowance with article 3 and the contribution referred to in article 4, as well as in agreement with the CPEL, the competences regarding the related controls. Paragraph 2 emphasizes how local authorities have the possibility of integrating with their own resources the amount of the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article four, while paragraph 3 highlights that the CPEL and the small mountain municipalities ensure the support activity to promote the dissemination of information regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4. Paragraph 4 deals with the communication aspect, in fact the Region, also through its instrumental bodies, must promote a communication campaign regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in article 4 in the French- and German-speaking states of the European Union. The communication campaign in the German-speaking states is aimed at encouraging the settlement of new German-speaking families only in the Walser municipalities of Issime/Eischeme, Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. Allthis is absolutely essential to always maintain a living identity from a cultural point of view and above all a specificity, in particular, towards the Walser Municipalities. Article 6 deals with a measure conceived to give help to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. A first step towards a great goal, a greater tax exemption for those who live in the mountains and who evidently have additional costs that must be counterbalanced. In paragraph 1, in fact, for the tax period 2024/2025/2026, even if the measure would then become structural, subjects with a total income, determined for the purposes of personal income tax, of up to 50 thousand euros and who live in small mountain municipalities, are exempt from paying the regional IRPEF surcharge. For the first time, I believe, the issue of tax exemption in some areas, only in some areas, which have higher costs, is addressed in a systematic way. A path, I believe, that should be followed. Article 7 inserts the evaluation clause, while Article 8 defines the financial provisions. Now, I will dwell for a moment on the financial provisions, because those who have studied the law in depth will have wondered why they are so long. Based on the data received from Dr. Nuvolari at the end of February 2024, relating to the money allocated but not yet committed to the various missions and programs, in-depth work was carried out to find the coverage. A law that concerns local authorities - someone suggested to me - should have been based on the resources of current transfers to local authorities. Now, I totally opposed this, as local authorities are not rolling in gold and because, if the law were approved, in perspective a whole series of services would have to continue to be maintained or services implemented, so cutting funds from current transfers to local authorities would have been wrong. We then tried to find funds by touching various missions in the least impactful way possible, with the aim of avoiding people saying: ""With this law, however, funds are being cut for health, education, public works"" and so on. I hope that this effort was appreciated, the effort of not making banal, simplistic arguments, of finding resources, in order only to make the numbers add up, but an in-depth study that would allow an attempt to find funds that were as fair and as least impactful as possible. Then, indeed, there was the political will to move forward... the resources could easily have been found in other missions and other programs. The opinion on the financial coverage of the law, given on October 7, was negative but then again, what could one expect after the law was discussed seven months after the appointment of the rapporteur on April 11? It is therefore obvious that the resources had already been spent. This was, in short, the proposed law. I thank my colleagues from the League for their support, the offices that have done a truly important job and also the majority Councilors who, by voting against this law in the Commission, have allowed its discussion in the Chamber."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,318,"The bill has been explained. Before opening the general discussion, I would like to inform you that today Councilor Ganis has communicated the withdrawal of his signature from the bill. Let's open the general discussion, the general discussion is open. Councilor Restano has booked, he has the right to do so."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Restano,Claudio,1964,M,RV,4,4696,"I speak on behalf of the Rassemblement Valdôtain group. We waited with a certain curiosity for the debate in the Commission on the text of the law proposed by our colleagues from the League to understand what the majority's position was and above all to understand if there were any developments regarding the proposed rule and its articulation. Why do I say this? Because we have worked on the subject, so much so that we had also presented an inspection initiative and we expressed doubts in the Commission that led to abstention, doubts regarding the possibility of applying this rule and above all the opportunity to coordinate it with a text of state law that was presented precisely by Rassemblement Valdôtain and amended in the first Commission, producing a Commission text. We learned today of the absence of amendments, perhaps in light of how the majority positioned itself in the Commission, which expressed a negative vote. From our point of view, this rule - which we appreciate, because we appreciate the effort and the will of our colleagues from the League - could have been more ambitious, much more ambitious, it could have foreseen a connection, as we said, with the rule that provides for the establishment of mountain free zones, it could also in light of what the rapporteur said in a correct and honest manner ... it did not have the ambition of being a solution to the problem and it addresses one of the aspects that could, together with many others, produce a reversal or facilitate a reversal of depopulation. It is clear that, compared to the data that our colleague has proposed to us, depopulation in recent decades and even much more has been significant, we limit ourselves to looking at the trend of recent years, as he said, and this is already significant. The habits of the people of the Aosta Valley have changed, their lifestyles, their ambitions, the way of undertaking the mountains have changed, but we have doubts about the definitions, the proposed definition and it is difficult to apply, ""Above 650 meters, with a certain population below"", however, as has already been said, the entire Aosta Valley is considered a mountain area. There are differences, but can we say that a municipality below 600 meters, which however experiences a phenomenon of significant hydrogeological instability, a marked economic backwardness, is not worthy of using this rule? Can we say that a municipality at 500 meters - with objective difficulties regarding tourist flows, the promotion of the territory - is not worthy of using this rule? It is very difficult. It is very difficult to say who may be inside, included in the rule or not, but above all what we believe is appropriate to verify and do is to coordinate the new text, such as the one proposed by colleagues, with the existing texts, with what is already being implemented in the mountains, and this is an important thing. We mainly value the productive aspect, how can we say that agriculture is not important in the mountains? This text does not talk about agriculture, perhaps because it is already included in other texts, but, in certain mountain areas, it is important to value agriculture, it is important to exempt from taxes as proposed by colleagues, but the rule on the mountain free zone that we proposed also concerns other types of taxes, it concerns IRAP, it would be important to coordinate it with this rule. We see, in this proposal, an interesting proposal, but one that must necessarily evolve. Our group is working on measures to propose, we have also worked on a text to propose, we were waiting for today's discussion, we are waiting for the budget, we are checking what may be cooking in the pot, we are maintaining a high level of attention on this rule, on this topic, as I think colleagues from all political forces do, including the Government. We believe a rule is necessary, there are other Regions that have already done so, I am talking about at least six Regions: Veneto, Trentino, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Piedmont and Lombardy. We believe that the Aosta Valley must produce an important text on the topic, it must not leave anyone behind, but above all it must allow us to highlight, to bring to the attention of the Regional Council all the particularities of our region, which do not depend on population density and altitude, but must consider other problems, other particularities. The colleague will express his opinion on this matterI will give the group's vote, and leave these considerations to the Council, believing that I have given them the opportunity to reason, especially with a view to the future, about what we might be able to do together."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,33,Councilor Jordan has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Jordan,Corrado,1973,M,UV,6,4762,"In addition to what has been said, we believe that it is necessary for the Regional Council to work on these measures, to promote living in the mountains, to promote our Municipalities, the Municipalities of the region that can be considered, as has already been said, marginal. The demographic crisis, depopulation and the closure of businesses are all elements that unfortunately involve many Municipalities, therefore situations that must be addressed, as far as possible, with the tools at our disposal, in a strategic vision, with so-called structural policies of longer duration and not with spot or limited interventions. Fighting depopulation in small mountain Municipalities necessarily requires an overall integrated approach, which therefore integrates regional policies with state policies and which considers the needs of local communities and the potential of the territory. I do not believe that there is a miracle recipe to resolve a trend that has multiple causes and that is objectively much more complex than can be highlighted today in this debate. English: I find and we find the proposal presented by colleague Lavy interesting, if only for having made some operational proposals available to everyone, proposals that however must be part of a virtuous process of actions, including bonuses, as foreseen, can be useful, but cannot be considered as structural and systematic actions. Actions that, although complex, can certainly prove more effective. I believe that it is necessary and appropriate that this comparison be in-depth and integrated with the proposals that were illustrated here in the Commission, on the occasion of the discussion on the application of the free zone, but also, and I add, all the initiatives that, in the institutional sphere, but also external to the institutions, I refer to the University, to the system of trade union organizations, must be put into common factor: all initiatives that in some way can contribute to helping us find the right recipe. And I also add that it is necessary to inevitably refer to the law on the mountains, currently under discussion in Parliament, and to the interesting initiatives that this law could also introduce for our territory. Only in this way, only later, now it is premature, could we have a complete picture of the opportunities that could be put in place and that should, as I said before, be integrated with the many actions already present in our region, we must not forget it, actions that favor small municipalities. I am thinking of education, the reality of subsidized schools, but also of the policies on the facilities of small ski resorts, the great equalization in a federalist perspective of regional transfers that see important resources to the smallest municipalities and, again, social policies, which beyond the difficulties that are evident, are important and if we look at the other regions we do not find them so active. As a contribution to the discussion, I indicate some actions that could be the object of an overall analysis that, in part, are already implemented and are effective, but in some cases could be further developed. It is clear that it would be important to be able to include tax breaks for individuals and legal entities, we talked about it in previous interventions - and the regional surtax is not enough, it would be necessary to do more, but the matter is a state competence, as my colleague Lavy said, and it needs to be explored - or with actions related to taxes and duties on housing, but here there is a significant problem of financial coverage. We must promote coworking spaces and improved connections, internet connectivity in marginal areas must be distributed, this is to promote smart working, support remote working for residents or for owners of second homes. We must further promote the improvement of the quality of life in relation to essential services in healthcare, with territorial structures and with telemedicine, I might add. We must further incentivize policies for the renovation of unused properties, as well as imagine policies to support housing in these territories, or even territorial marketing campaigns, to attract new residents and new tourists, focusing on an image of quality of life linked to the montagna and nature. Finally, and I am aware that I have not made an exhaustive analysis, collaborations between local authorities are useful, indeed, necessary, in order to define inter-municipal networks of services to share resources and develop common projects."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,7,35,"Councilor Minelli, you have the authority."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,8,4731,"We have already read the proposal of our colleagues from the League some time ago and we have also listened with interest to the report by our colleague Lavy, a report in which, even in the text accompanying the law, we appreciated the in-depth analysis that was made of the situation that concerns many Municipalities in our region. It is an in-depth, timely analysis, we can see that there is work behind it, even serious work of in-depth analysis, and we recognize that there has been an effort on your part in presenting this proposed law, in which we see, however, some elements of weakness that raise, also on our part, doubts. The first concerns precisely the identification of the Municipalities that are included in the list of those that would benefit from the proposed measures, and - as our colleague Lavy also explained - a synthesis has been found between the parameters relating to the number of inhabitants less than 800 units and the location of the town hall above 650 meters. This leads to having, in this list, Municipalities that are extremely different and that can hardly even be considered with regard to the critical issues, the risks, the economic situation. I'll give you an example: the situation between Pontboset and Torgnon is certainly different, because we know very well - and the population data that my colleague Lavy cited also say so - that it is not so much a question of inhabitants, but of the development or non-development situation that leads these two realities - I'll give you just this example - to be very different. I live in one of the Municipalities that would be included in the list and I must say that there are some other doubts: my colleague Lavy also said that a system had to be found also with regard to concrete aid, therefore contributions, or the system of services. We believe that a bill that really intervenes and helps the realities of these Municipalities should focus, rather than a series of contributions, on the introduction or implementation, because it is not that there are no services, but the implementation of services. Then there is an aspect that we do not think is so easy to apply, for example the condition that must be respected to maintain what you have called Chèque Valdôtain and the other related to births, the Chèque Montagnard. It is said that the sine qua non condition is that the residence in the municipality where this contribution was obtained must be maintained for ten years. Now we know that there is a dynamic of population movements that is very strong; I am talking about the municipality where I live, which I know well: we have very fast population movements, people who come, children who attend school for a period and then move, and I do not believe that the possibility of having these 5 thousand euros for the birth of the child or for residence in the municipality, can constitute a strong attraction and a motivation to remain in that territory over time. As for Chèque Montagnard and Chèque Valdôtain, it is then said that it would be necessary for each new family unit that decides to move to one of the small mountain towns to attend a course in Franco-Provençal language or culture or Titsch or Töitschu language. I believe that it is already very difficult - I am thinking above all of people who come from distant countries, but not only - to create the conditions for there to be a possibility of daily communication, therefore of knowledge of the Italian or French language, and I think that learning our languages ​​and dialects must also be something linked to a desire for integration that some people have. I am referring to my reality, we have people who are of Romanian or Moroccan origin who speak patois very well, but it was not an imposition, they learned it by being with the population, creating bonds and also having a personal desire for integration, for knowledge of the territory. A course imposed on each family unit that would come to reside in these towns seems a bit forced to us. Same issue for the birth allowance, which is like the other. While appreciating the effort that has been made and sharing some of the assessments that have been made, because it is certainly a problem, the one we have of the depopulation of the mid-mountain, we think that perhaps the reflection should be broader, more articulated and focus on arange of services that must be guaranteed to those who have decided, voluntarily or involuntarily, to continue living in the mountains or to come and live in the mid-mountain, for which our vote will be a vote of abstention."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,9,38,"Councilor Chatrian, it's your turn."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Chatrian,Albert,1975,M,UV,10,7725,"I join in thanking you, colleague Lavy, for the work that has been done and allow me to reason a little on this bill, but above all on the architectural system proposed by the colleague. We must look at ourselves honestly, around this hall there is a completely different Valle d'Aosta compared to the numbers and steps that have been taken also in relation, so we absolutely must know our history, we absolutely must know our potential, and there is a lot of it, but we must also have the ability to accompany the process on our legislative level: what has been done, what is being done but above all what can or must still be done. There is certainly room, if today we are addressing this issue in this way it is because with regard to a whole series of measures, laws, support, with regard to identity and also culture, despite everything, we can say it - it is not a nice word perhaps - but we have held firm. If we look at our neighbor Piedmont, if we look at our neighbor Lombardy, their lateral valleys, I think we have been quite good, but probably we absolutely must have that ability to find other solutions. To find other supports - but I don't put the economic issue at the center, not the financial issue - I put the quality of life at the center. The proposed law is ""Urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities"", whether they are small, medium or somewhere in between doesn't matter. I think the most important challenge is to guarantee services 365 days a year, because then the risk - and I'm talking about where I live, where I absolutely know more - is that the high tourist lands are guaranteed all the services for nine months, but that in those other three months they are practically ghost towns. The medium tourist lands perhaps manage to guarantee a whole series of public or private services for 12 months, but with many difficulties, but then we have a medium mountain that perhaps - I remember the passage my colleague made before - suffers more than the others, because it doesn't have that tourist potential and, therefore, doesn't have, either in season or out of season, a whole series of services that the other two elements I highlighted have. In all of this, undoubtedly, I think the most delicate part is that linked to work-family balance. What is the goal to create those conditions so that families, new or not, decide to live and not survive in the high or medium mountains? It is to be able to reconcile work... I open a parenthesis: in the high lands there is a lot of it in the two seasons, I close the parenthesis. In the intermediate lands, therefore in the medium mountains, it is more delicate, but there we can work in a different way with transport and on this I open another parenthesis: it seems to me that the efforts that are being made as a public are truly important efforts, I highlight this knowing very well the efforts that the public is making but, despite everything, today, for a family that lives in a medium mountain, or in the high lands, and does not have a private means, I assure you that it is not easy, if the work is not on site, to reconcile family and work. I have given examples that we all know, but perhaps every now and then it is also important to repeat them and highlight them. Returning to the issue, I repeat, some ideas are interesting within this system, but they must then be accompanied... one has already been said by other colleagues: by the law of the mountain, which we hope will be found at a political mountain level, by those who at least know these territories and these needs... and, on the other hand, by the implementing rule that will give us the possibility of going, why not, to regulate further with measures and with tools that are also innovative, also of an economic-financial nature, but I put them as a last resort, because perhaps the most important challenge on our more political level is to succeed in getting that message across related to the fact that it becomes an important lifestyle choice but different from the central axis of the main valley which is the one that goes from Pont-Saint-Martin to Courmayeur. In all this we cannot hide, colleague Lavy, perhaps you are a lover of numbers like me, but then, when you know the numbers, you have to find solutions to the critical issues. We have a demographica decline that is very strong, in 2012-2013-2014 the births in Valle d'Aosta were about 1,300, today the births in Valle d'Aosta in the last two years are about 700; it is a further element: despite all the efforts that we are making as an Autonomous Region, these are undoubtedly raw data, but that not only must make us reflect, but that must spur us to find further solutions. I end by saying that on this basis, on the fact - hopefully in the short term - that the law on mountains can be approved at a national level, that we can put together, in any case, all those measures that today are included in various regional laws. In a few weeks we will go to approve the 2025-2026 budget... the dignity that this majority, and I hope that other political forces also approve those articles ... we give certainties to the system of local authorities again; Local authorities, Municipalities, which guarantee a good part of the services in the territories, Local authorities that provide those services, above all you mentioned the small, medium or slightly larger Municipalities of medium and high mountains. Without these tools, I think that today our lateral valleys would be similar to those of Piedmont and, alas, similar to those of Lombardy. You have reported very well within the report, taking us back to 1860-1870, when La Magdeleine and Chamois had X inhabitants; I live in Torgnon and La Magdeleine does not have 100 inhabitants, Chamois does not reach 100 inhabitants, and Torgnon and Antey together barely reach 1,000 inhabitants. to give some examples. English: Earlier, my colleague Minelli, rightly, highlighted the difference between a Pontboset and a Torgnon, but I would not wage war on the poor and would try to find solutions to prevent people from surviving in the middle or high mountains, but to be able, instead, to succeed together in guaranteeing that quality of life - which in the end is our role, that of creating the best laws, legislating to achieve those specific objectives - so that people, families decide to make drastic choices, because, I assure you, by just putting together the main ones - services, transport, school, health, sport, aggregation policies, local authorities, work and work-life balance (I've listed eight) - if one stops only at the economic-financial issue, if there were all the measures that we as a Region put in place, I think that our valleys would be completely different. Despite this, we can probably make a further effort, a further push, it would be nice to be able to do it together, this can also be an interesting starting point, intertwining proposals that are also innovative, but, if I can give you some advice, colleague Lavy, let's put aside the exclusively fiscal, economic, financial issue, I assure you that the most important part is - in my opinion, our point of view also as a group - to be able to improve the quality of life of the people who choose to stay anyway, because many, often, love the mountains, Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, but living there 365 days is a lifestyle choice."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,11,33,Councilor Perron has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979,M,LEGA VDA,12,2822,"I will intervene briefly, also taking up the last cue from colleague Chatrian. I will abstract myself from the fiscal issues, the more economic issues, because I think that this law, with the work that colleague Lavy has done, is a bit of an attempt - which I would also define as original and fully in line with a true autonomist spirit - to also create something new, that is, if we are here, in the end the highest role that we can have as Councilors is precisely that of legislators, therefore an attempt that, I repeat, I consider commendable precisely for this sense of novelty, of originality that is put on the table; also pioneering as an attempt, certainly - all pioneering attempts have their defects, that is, they can certainly have them, and here the colleagues who make notes on some particularities of the law, clearly have their reasons - but, I repeat, it is a pioneering attempt and in this way it should be evaluated. In my opinion, this bill demonstrates considerable interest, also because, in the background, in addition to economic and fiscal issues - on which colleagues are much more knowledgeable than I am, who am a terrifying accountant from that point of view - there are other underlying issues: for example, that of identity, which is a fundamental issue, and which in some way this law touches upon. If we ask ourselves today who the people of the Aosta Valley are, today, in 2024, how can we define the people of the Aosta Valley in 2024, when already starting from the last century, starting from fascism, we had the first waves of migration? Let's think of the Venetians, then let's think of the post-war period with Calabrian immigration, and today immigration from various parts of the world. In this law, therefore, there is an attempt - in my opinion, strong and intelligent - to propose solutions that can favor those who can and want to integrate in the Aosta Valley territory and be part of a community, a community that uses in this case the linguistic medium as a system to make participants, but that is put on the table. I understand the colleague who says: ""Making it mandatory becomes something of..."", but it is an attempt to create cohesion, create a community, on the basis that are our identity characteristics, because French, and perhaps even more Franco-Provençal, is something that we must not lose. In conclusion, practically everything has already been said in the colleague's report, I would like to point out that, with this attempt, our party demonstrates in a certain sense a vitality and a pioneering spirit to present laws that are also new and that, despite some defects, certainly go to signify, on our part, a desire to look beyond the horizons that have been used so far by those who have governed the region in recent years."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,13,31,Councilor Lavy has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,14,11486,"I thank my colleagues for the debate. I will proceed in order, to try to answer the various questions that have been put on the table, because I knew very well that in the end the tone of the answers would be this, a sort of whataboutism, the need to make a global provision, the need to reflect and that's fine, we go on for years, years and years reflecting, but we see the phenomenon, but, precisely, I will proceed in order, starting with the words of my colleague Restano, who asked if, in some way, this text could not be related to the one on mountain free zones, which we absolutely supported, because it is something interesting, but it has a limit: temporariness, so that if a mountain free zone is applied in a certain territory, it lasts a certain number of years and then the condition remains, it returns to the previous one, because the structural deficits of the territory remain. If you are half an hour away from Aosta, it's not that with the mountain free zone that time is reduced, it still leaves half an hour away, that's how it is; it's certainly very interesting, but the free zone has a temporary nature, so after a certain number of years those measures end. If you wanted to have collaboration, it was possible to do so, because the text on mountain free zones was promoted, I think, in July, if I remember correctly, and this law has been tabled since April, so if there had been the will to talk to each other, this was there. I noticed, and I already said it in the discussion of that law, that you took inspiration from this law, from article 6, the one on the exemption from the regional IRPEF surcharge: you put it a little more generally, but this doesn't seem so much like collaboration to me but, more than anything else, and here for the proposed state law - it's certainly an interesting proposal - at least one article was copied a little. On the criteria, it is obvious and I said it first: the criteria are absolutely debatable, that is, who can define what is a mountain and what is not a mountain today? We made an attempt, but where is yours? Because it is easy to say: ""Well, these criteria, 800 inhabitants, 650 meters, are not good, we need to find others"", and what are these others? What are they? It is easy to say, right? Try to write down some and then let's think about it. The first day I arrived at the Commission I said: ""If you have any proposals, make them""; zero proposals, not even one, so don't say that the criteria are wrong, they are not entirely convincing, I am the first to say it, but if you had a better proposal you should have made it. I have not seen any proposals. My colleague Jordan said that this would be a law that has spot and limited interventions: I don't know if the text is clear, it seems so, these measures are structural, therefore, if this law were approved, the measures would last as long as one wants, both contributions and also the additional IRPEF exemption. I included the three-year period because I was forced to include it, because it is necessary to base the tax period on the three-year period, but that measure would also have been structural. Then I agree that the additional regional IRPEF exemption is not enough, I agree, but in the meantime let's start doing this if it is possible and if there is the will, given that there is so much talk about the mountains. As for the question of life choices, the 10 years, the fact of the Titsch and Töitschu Franco-Provençal course: a measure like that, bringing people to live in a context like the mountains, which is absolutely not simple, indeed, it is a serious life choice, very serious... so one knows that, if one decides to come and live in that territory and accesses the contributions, one must stay there for ten years. If one has doubts about not staying, one does not come, period, one does not come, one does not make that choice, one goes somewhere else, one goes to the city and does not make that choice or knows where it is, if one is happy. Same thing for the language course, one knows that one must do it, if one does not want to do it, that's it, one does not come, it is not a problem. This serves to integrate those who come, but also to give us a wake-up call, because we are the first ones not to speak our patois to our children, it is a dramatic thing, and then it is obvious that everything is lost. If the Valdostano is told: ""Look, there's that guy who arrived yesterday, who's taking a patois course, do you speak it?"", ""No"", perhaps a little bit of pride can arise.or and say: ""No, we must also speak our languages, it's not that the one who arrived yesterday has to speak them. Talking about services: the talk about services is absolutely central, but the two things must go hand in hand. In the 80s (let's put it that way) did we have more or fewer services than today in the mountain areas? Probably more. We have bank branches - I will make a question regarding banking desertification and so on - but how many more schools did we have? Lots. If 40 years ago we had more services and today there are fewer, it means that services are not the condition for which people remain in the mountains at all costs - it is a very important condition but it is not the only one - so we must act on an aspect that is often not considered here: living in the mountains costs more, we already think only of the cost of heating, so if we do not meet the needs of those who live in certain areas and have higher costs, it is obvious that someone may decide to leave. Then, again, colleague Chatrian, you said: ""If we are addressing this issue today, it is because we have held (you used this ugly term, you said it) compared to other regions"", and I totally agree, if we go and look at Piedmont, certain valleys are dramatically empty, there is no one left or almost no one. We are perhaps 20-30 years behind those valleys, if, in some way, today we do not take measures that can reverse the situation, that is the objective we will reach, because - you always said, colleague Chatrian - demography is an exact science. Today we have so many births, in perspective we could have so many inhabitants, without considering those who then leave, and that is another matter. Certainly the issue of services must be brought forward and certainly this is a text that cannot be comprehensive, but if we want to wait for a comprehensive text, good luck, it will take us two centuries to put everything in. Let's start with a text... then the interesting thing, and President Testolin also said it in the Commission, when he came, he said: ""Do you have any doubts? On some issues, I am the first to have doubts""; and that's fine, but let's try experimentally to carry forward a law of this kind. Let's choose two or three Municipalities, which may also have different characteristics, and let's try in some way to experiment with these measures. After five years we will see the results, if there are no results, I am the first to say: ""No, this is the wrong path"", but if we don't even try, let's not come and say that this is something that perhaps is not useful. Let's try experimentally, then we'll see, but here there is never the courage to do anything, so we sit on what we are already doing and in the meantime everything falls apart. Because here, talking about mountains, talking about high lands, talking about villages, there are not many, or rather, there are some who are mostly those who still live in these territories and, if we count, those who come from more mountainous municipalities, we are no longer many, indeed, we are very, very few. Here, also with a view to future representation, it is obvious that in perspective those who come from the city, those who come from the Plaine, have an increasingly greater electoral and representative weight, therefore those who come from the mountains in the chamber will be fewer and fewer, because, I see, of my generation, there are very few people who live there and who then deal with politics, so in perspective we risk handing over the Aosta Valley - which some say is an entirely mountainous territory - to people who know nothing about mountains. This is an important aspect, therefore, either we do something now, even with strong, experimental measures, otherwise we raise the white flag, consider Piazza Chanoux a mountain, because someone will end up saying this, by now in certain parameters Aosta is considered entirely a mountain. For goodness sake, some hamlets yes, they are, but Aosta is not a mountain, I'm sorry. I will reserve for myself in the declaration of vote perhaps some considerations, because we have many paradoxes. For example, we have a deputy of the Union Valdôtaine who proposes a motion in Parliament for the internal areas and the mountain areas. OK, we are all capable of proposing motions, but then I would like to understand what he thinks of this proposed law, understand if it could be interesting or not. The fact that I have noticed, because it is obviousmind it's not that once I presented the bill I was there sleeping, I went around and went to 23 Municipalities, to 23 Mayors, who were in fact protagonists of this bill. Some of these, who then surprised me, were surprised by the fact that for the first time, in the span of their government of the Municipality, there was a Regional Councilor who went to visit them - something that sincerely left me amazed - and all these Mayors have nevertheless expressed great attention towards this law, really great attention, some more than others, for goodness sake, knowing full well that it was not decisive, but then we know that politics acts in certain systems and the CPEL above all acts, we see it: many mayors are the first to complain about depopulation, but then they don't vote for this law. Many mayors are there complaining about the fact that they have deserted centers and then vote against the moratorium that would block the birth of new commercial businesses, so zero coherence on the part of many mayors. But honor to those who instead with pride - because I was told that some did not flatten out, as many do - to an opinion of the CPEL proposed by some Mayors, in a very strong way, expressed themselves against that opinion of abstention of the CPEL, saying that this law could be a tool to combat the phenomenon of depopulation. Honor to these mayors who truly have courage, because we all know very well that not falling into line in certain circles, when there are certain proposals, is not at all simple. This was a complex bill, which touches on one of the aspects of the depopulation of the mountains, which I called a puzzle; this is a piece of the puzzle, and everyone said that it is made up of interesting measures. So I say to myself: but why not try it? Because either you tell a lie, saying that they are interesting measures and you do not consider them as such, or you fill your mouth with words and then, in practice, when there is something different, parallel to the discussion of services and so on, you do nothing. The doubt is that if this proposal had been made by a majority Councilor, probably all these doubts, all these conspiracy theories, all these ""Eh, but a general evaluation is needed"", these reasonings would not have been made. This is a doubt, for goodness sake, I know very well that it does not work that way. I have finished, I will save myself for the declaration of vote."

If there are no other interventions in the discussion, I close the general discussion. The general discussion is closed. For the Government, Councilor Caveri replies."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958,M,UV,16,5844,"The President will also speak, I will limit myself to a few observations, starting of course from what has already been said, that is, the difficulties, we all know what happens, but fortunately we are not at year zero, because, thanks to autonomy, our territory, despite all its limitations, remains inhabited, remains alive, especially - as has already been done - if we compare it only with the nearby Piedmont valleys: also from a political and administrative point of view, as we well know, they even depend on the metropolitan area of ​​Turin and, if we had not had autonomy, it is very probable that today we would find ourselves in the same and identical situation. The topic that has been raised is interesting and the proposal is also interesting, but it has a whole series of weaknesses, so the reasoning of councilor Lavy is: ""Better a little something than nothing"". I believe instead that, when a line has to be decided, it must be done in a complete manner, and in this regard, in a few minutes, I will try to make some reasoning. I am returning from a meeting on the Alpine macro-region in Slovenia: it is an assembly that certainly needs to be strengthened, it has weaknesses, it was officially born at the beginning of the 2010s and I took the liberty of drawing the attention of my colleagues to ask for greater political commitment and less technocratic vision within the Alpine macro-region, because I believe that the issues that we must address today are four plus one: the first is climate change, which will profoundly modify our territory; the second topic is the energy transition, also considering the ambitious prospects that the Valle d'Aosta Council itself has given itself; the digital revolution, someone mentioned the fact that repopulation also involves techniques such as co-working, and, again, the demographic crisis that, in the Aosta Valley, is actually added to depopulation, that is, the choice that many Aosta Valley residents, since the post-war period, have made to move down, some to the larger municipalities of the valley floor, some instead to the city of Aosta which in the meantime has spread out across what we call the Plaine. Another argument is added that is central to believing that the Aosta Valley is all mountains, which of course does not mean that there can be classifications by area within us; I am not convinced by the altimetry, because someone pointed out that today - as Bernard Janin, the famous geographer, said - those who are most in crisis are those of the medium mountains, if we use the altimetry, we will somehow also facilitate tourist locations where well-being is completely evident. The extra costs are striking, what the University of the Aosta Valley is doing is important, taking up a theme from a few years ago: understanding what the impact of schools, transport, healthcare means; all expenses that weigh heavily on our regional budget and that demonstrate the particularity of the mountain areas that will have to be highlighted, especially when they arrive alongside, or perhaps no longer alongside, differentiated autonomy, the famous LEP. Another scenario: there is a European scenario that we must follow, because we have the same problems: President Kompatscher himself, in a dialogue also with President Testolin, reminded us that they have a high demographic but that has fallen below that percentage of the fertility rate that guarantees a replacement for the population. We are graveyard-like from this point of view. The study by Professor Rosina of the Catholic University of Milan has shown that in 2034 we will have 10 thousand fewer Aosta Valley residents in the intermediate age, that is, the most productive. I would add, because it is very important, that any regional law, which in some way better regulates the particularity of territories higher than the average, must take into account the law on mountains which, with its 28 articles, was approved by the Senate, not because we have to copy it - I am always for original legislation - but because this law allows on the one hand to have a whole series of particularities that can be demonstrated in the legislation of the Regions and autonomous Provinces and, on the other, there are interventions in the matter that are not our competence. I think it would be interesting to imagine reopening a discussion when we find ourselves faced with a complete text that,among other things, it touches on one of the main issues for the Italian mountains, which is the delimitation of mountain areas, because, if there is too much mountain (as happens today in the old delimitations, even from the 1950s) it is very difficult to imagine specific interventions, which are also valid - I remind you in conclusion - for the European Union. With the new President of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, right in Slovenia, we have imagined a European mountain pact, starting from the Alpine mountains, because it is very clear that today in article 174 of the treaties we talk about mountain areas, but that necessary directive that should say what the mountain is, which is then different in the Massif Central rather than in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Apennines, has remained suspended, but a regulation is needed taking into account that many of the matters that we have in article 2 of our Statute of autonomy - I am thinking of agriculture - are ultimately now linked to decisions that are taken by European politics. It is therefore right to give recognition to the intellectual effort, the legal effort, to arrive at something, however, in all frankness, I believe that the picture is more complex and it can be said that if this was the beginning of a discussion it is good, but it cannot be considered a conclusive phase."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,17,42,The President of the Region has the authority to do so.
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,18,6328,"I believe that following the last intervention of colleague Caveri there is little left to add. I would like to make some considerations of a more strictly related nature to the framework on which this legislative initiative was intended to be inserted; a regulatory framework already quite broad, which we had the opportunity to share also during an inspection activity (recalled by colleague Restano) which underlined how within the evolutionary path and attention to the mountain territory and the difficulties of living there... because one thing is to look for prerequisites and indications to support - even on an ongoing basis, assuming that it is the best way - the population that lives in the mountains to be able to do so at lower costs, another thing is to make it usable in an adequate manner and also in step with the times... also so to speak ""infrastructured"" and also generous with opportunities, especially work and support for one's family in the mountains with adequate services; they are two slightly different concepts and the main aspect is to go and observe how a whole series of initiatives that we had already shared there have tried over time to enhance the characteristics of our mountain, with road safety and with the infrastructure, which started in the 90s, of that backbone that should have brought the optical fiber - and brought it, up to our highest villages. Even yesterday, in an interesting meeting developed within the Department of colleague Caveri, with Infratel some opportunities were outlined that can actually create new potential for those who want to move to the mountains. This is a job that is daily accompanied by specific laws to try to enhance the job offers of our territory. : Colleague Jordan mentioned it, also taking up a track that we had already presented a few weeks ago: from support for ski resorts to mountain schools, transport concessions, special attention also to the size and accessibility of the same, initiatives on neighborhood businesses - to talk about situations that are developed within the Regional Council - but, still, in a broader context, among the opportunities that can be made available to the mountains, there are European resources that, first of all, through the rural development plan and activities related to the agricultural world, have tried to enhance a whole series of historical and traditional activities that maintain opportunities for settlement in our territory even in small municipalities and especially in small municipalities where rightly a company, one, two, five people, a family make the difference, despite what may happen in the valley floor. A situation that is also very complex at a national level, I remember that in the years 2015-2016, when there were the first activities to support marginal areas, paradoxically the case occurred where, for example, Cogne, which is a tourist resort of primary importance for our region, was included in the marginal areas when - now I don't want to be wrong - Avise or Saint-Nicolas, which had slightly different altimetric characteristics and not such a significant percentage drop in population as that of Cogne, was not included. Two paradoxes that, if we go to see the two locations, give you a feeling of mountains that is not exactly the same. This is to arrive at the fact that there is a network, a series of initiatives and activities that continue to be developed, such as the investments that are advocated in our territory also at the level of ski lifts, but also all those activities that try to bring safety also for those who live in the mountains: we have already mentioned it a couple of times, but I will never tire of saying it: the helicopter rescue rather than the valorization of those ski-mountaineering activities linked to the world of randonnées, which can and must also bring young people - just as you said - to our territory. This must be accompanied - as my predecessor rightly said - by more structured, more structural indications, which pass on the one hand certainly from the law of the mountain, which has been questioned, which provides a guideline on which a regional mechanism of study and adaptation can then be grafted alsoto the characteristics and peculiarities of our territory; on the other hand, a law on the free zone that has as its objective not so much to stabilize over time and over the years, over the decades, a support and a contribution, but to create the conditions to relaunch above all an activity in our marginal areas, which is proclaimed and guaranteed, to which the Region will probably have to contribute, in an important way, with its resources, because let's say that the feeling is rather that we need to clear the principle of being able to identify autonomously, or in any case agreed, the areas in which we want to intervene, because evidently - you teach me - Courmayeur rather than Valtournenche perhaps have less need than Rhêmes-Saint-Georges, rather than Lillianes, Gaby or Champorcher, of initiatives that can be developed in their territory with important help, limited perhaps in time but which can allow the activation of initiatives in these territories that can then give legs to a virtuous circle that can bring interest back to our territory. This is what we had already said a bit in the Commission, net of other technicalities relating to what is coverage, not coverage. However, it remains, not out of respectability, the fact of recognizing the initiative as having a transversal consensus, which I think was also demonstrated by the colleagues who spoke; I also appreciated the fact that he underlined the negative vote that nevertheless allowed this bill to be brought to the floor and discussed and I believe that the interest is transversal, as has been underlined, and that there will still be time and a way to work carefully especially on those two elements that can really make a difference in this context."
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,19,60,Councillor Ganis has the right to declare his vote.
47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,20,3096,"I thank the speakers and proponents of this bill, the 138 of the League. Bill 138 represents an attempt to address one of the most pressing challenges of mountain communities, which is that of depopulation. The Aosta Valley, like many other mountain regions, is experiencing a progressive exodus of the population from smaller centers to the cities; this phenomenon has significant repercussions on the local economy, on culture and on the valorization of our territories. The proposal aims to reverse this trend through a series of concrete measures, mainly focused on economic incentives, therefore the birth allowance or Chèque Valdôtain, an economic contribution to families who choose to have children in small mountain municipalities, incentives for new residents, the Chèque Montagnard, tax breaks and contributions for those who ask or decide to settle in these territories and the enhancement of the territory through the promotion of local culture, therefore support for traditions and minority languages, the development of sustainable tourism, investments and environmentally friendly tourism activities and the guarantee of basic services such as healthcare, school and transport, we talked about it before. From an initial analysis, the League's proposal presents several strong points, a concrete approach, therefore the proposed measures are specific and targeted to solve the problems, attention to families, therefore: incentives for births, for families with children and an enhancement of the territory. In our opinion, even if the proposal represents a step forward in the direction of a regional policy more attentive to the needs of mountain municipalities, some problems emerge; one of these is economic sustainability: putting these measures into practice requires significant economic resources and long-term effectiveness. Economic incentives can be a first step, but a more structural approach is needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of mountain municipalities; collaboration with local authorities: the success of these measures also depends on collaboration with municipalities, as my colleague Chatrian pointed out. To reach a conclusion, the Lega's bill 138 represents an important contribution to the debate on the enhancement of mountain areas, raising a topic of great importance and future for our region, however it is important to underline that the problem linked to the phenomenon of depopulation cannot be solved only with economic incentives, we have said and reiterated several times that a series of long-term territorial development political actions are needed, which take into account all the actors involved in order to achieve concrete and lasting results. Assuming that this bill could also be amended in order to improve it and make it more suitable to the needs of our community, we as a group appreciate the work and for this reason we will vote for it."

47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,22,4170,"Thank you, Mr President, for the final considerations that emerged after the Government's reply. I don't know if Councillor Caveri has actually read ""Tradition et renouveau"" by Janin because otherwise, I don't know, he probably wouldn't have made certain arguments... (Interruption off-microphone by Councillor Caveri.) ...It's not offensive at all, far from it. The issue of altimetry, for goodness sake, is debatable, but I would perhaps invite you one day, indeed, to live a little, to go to Marine di Perloz: I would like to see if that isn't a mountain. It's not a high mountain, for goodness sake, but it is a mountain. Then the issue of climate change is fine, it's obvious that we are facing epochal challenges, as there have always been throughout history, for goodness sake, today we have new ones and therefore we must rightly adapt. The issue of additional costs, which you brought up - if you were offended before, now I give you credit for bringing up an issue that is essential - the issue of additional costs is central, I said it: living in the mountains costs more, and that is why I believe that there is a need for economic help, on the one hand with contributions, on the other with tax relief, things that are proposed by this law, so, for goodness sake, do you not understand 100% how? All right, but, as I said before, where is your proposal? The issue of demography, which was also touched upon earlier by my colleague Chatrian: ""Eh, but this law talks about a birth allowance"", more demography than that... so you can say anything, but not that this law does not touch on the issue of demography. Then President Testolin, as usual, glosses over it a bit... but the thing I'm thinking about - and in my notes I had the answer you gave to colleague Restano, when I mentioned law 17 and various laws - is that it doesn't seem to me that in these laws there is a specific part for mountain areas. There are laws that apply to all areas, so if we take law 17, those who have a farm in the valley bottom and those who have a farm at 1,500 meters benefit from it. It's obvious that it's a law that also helps those who live in the mountains, it's not a law that's only made for those who live in the mountains and that compensates for the extra costs of those who live in the mountains; that's the point. Our laws are not diversified, they are the same for everyone, on the one hand that's fine, on the other hand I think we also need to reflect, but then it's not that those laws only help those who live in the mountains. I really, to conclude, because I understood that there is none, I would really like you to go for a tour of many villages in our municipalities, around the Valley, all the municipalities have villages that are now abandoned, or almost, and there you will understand the roots of depopulation, really. Go to the valleys and talk to those who remain and who will explain to you that their son has decided to leave, maybe not even abroad, he has come down. You will understand from these people the reason why people leave: the extra costs - you said it, Councilor Caveri - and those villages there, if it goes well, will become second homes, if it goes badly, they will be ruined. It is this policy of saying ""We are already doing"" that kills those villages, that kills planning. Let's question ourselves for once, it is not possible to say ""We are already doing, everything is fine"", look at the valleys of Piedmont, we all see the valleys of Piedmont, but if we continue like this, we too will get to the valleys of Piedmont. Let's question ourselves, let's bring forward measures that can also be experimental, the free zone issue is absolutely positive but it's not enough, it's not enough! Do you know when we will no longer talk about depopulation? When the last elder of the last village has passed away, then there will no longer be the problem of depopulation, because there will no longer be anyone living in the Aosta Valley. The fact that there was no will to reason in a concrete way on a text of law and that this law has favorable, interesting principles, but that are not enough, is truly a stab in the back to those who live in the mountains."

47990,XVI,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979,M,LEGA VDA,24,2155,"Obviously I will vote in favor of this law. If before I highlighted the side of the autonomist spirit that distinguishes this proposed law, on the other hand I simply want to underline, as I said before, beyond the economic factor, an element that strongly characterizes our political force, that is the League, because this is, from another point of view, the attempt to attract to our territory, in particular to the mountain area, an immigration that can be chosen, an immigration that can be sustainable, in contrast to those who instead claim or think that anyone can come to our territory, even when they have attitudes or cultures or mentalities that are difficult to integrate with our millenary culture. I repeat, a law perfectly in line with our party that sees and thinks that those who can come to our territory and feel and become fully-fledged Aosta Valley citizens must be people who have the tools to integrate; in this case it would be the regional body itself that provides tools from a linguistic point of view, which is fundamental. From this point of view, therefore, I believe that it is a bill that is a real shame to remain there, but I think that it will remain, in any case, in the archives and one day, when perhaps historians will look back and listen to the debates of this Council, they will be able to see who had at least the courage to propose something, even on an experimental basis, because my colleague said it very well: even on an experimental basis, rather than settle for and adapt to dynamics that we cannot control without making an effort, perhaps even wrong, perhaps that does not work, but an effort that represents a novelty towards phenomena of great importance and that unfortunately we are unable to govern. I believe that this is a real shame, but, I repeat, whoever proposed something new and had the courage to do so will remain in the annals, while, on the other hand, whoever perhaps made criticisms, had good intentions, then on the table, however, never put anything innovative."

However, it is difficult to answer the question I am asking: ""Whether economic aid can affect the life choices of the family and in particular of our children"". I believe that there are other values, for example the love of the mountains, of culture, of traditions, that cannot be monetized, even at the cost of sacrifices, then tomorrow everything will surely change.

47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,2,8009,"The upcoming introduction of fifth-generation mobile phone technology, hereinafter of course referred to as 5G, will give rise to new scenarios of population exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, which will be placed in frequency bands, 694-790 MHz, 3.6-3.8 GHz and 26.5-27.5 GHz, different from those currently used for mobile telephony, from 800 MHz to 2.6 GHz. One of the particularly novel aspects of 5G is that it will not only be aimed at communication between people, but also at the so-called Internet of Things, in which various wireless devices communicate directly with each other, using in particular electromagnetic waves of frequency belonging to the 26.5-27.5 GHz band, often referred to as millimetre waves, even if the latter correspond more precisely to frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz, wavelengths between 1 and 10 mm. Electromagnetic waves of such high frequency, during their propagation, they cannot penetrate buildings or overcome obstacles and are also easily absorbed by rain and leaves. For this reason, it will be necessary to use, to a greater extent than current mobile phone technologies, the so-called Small Cells, areas of land covered by the radio frequency signal whose dimensions, which can range from about ten meters indoors to a few hundred meters outdoors, are much smaller than those of macro cells, which can extend up to several kilometers. This will require the installation of numerous antennas and this proliferation of antennas is one of the main causes of concern among the population about possible health risks associated with 5G electromagnetic emissions. Following the 2013 IARC assessment, which defined radio frequency electromagnetic fields as possible carcinogens due to the effects on head tumors linked to prolonged use of cell phones, numerous studies have been conducted that have investigated the associations between long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields and various health problems, oncological and otherwise. Exposures not resulting from the use of mobile phones but from other sources, such as SRB radio base stations, are of a different nature, especially because the possible effects are not limited to the head and, as appears from monitoring studies, are of lesser intensity. To date, studies on the health effects of exposure to radio base stations provide conflicting results. Furthermore, due to emission limits, 62% of existing sites in urban areas would not be upgradeable to 5G and the extra costs, to create coverage, would amount to approximately 1.3 billion euros per operator. To maintain 6 Volts per meter, an expense of approximately 4 billion euros per year is estimated, a decidedly high cost for telephone companies. It should also be emphasized that 5G emissions combine with other forms of electromagnetic emissions, all with the consequences that such emissions can have on both health and the environment. A group of Swedish researchers have published the world's first study documenting the immediate effects of 5G radiation on human health. These are groups of people who, between 2023 and 2024, began to feel ill immediately after the installation of new 5G antennas near their homes, precisely at a distance of between 3 and 538 meters. In some cases, the symptoms were so severe that they forced people to move elsewhere. The research was conducted by oncologist Dr. Lennart Hardell of the Swedish Foundation for Environment and Cancer Research, known for epidemiological studies on tumors among cell phone users, in collaboration with Mona Nilsson of the Swedish Foundation for Radiation Protection. The researchers measured the electromagnetic field in the homes of those who complained of 5G-related health problems and documented that 5G involves a significant increase in pulsed radiofrequency radiation compared to previous generations of mobile telephony. The people in the study had been living near mobile phone repeaters for years, but had never complained of disturbances with the reactions of 2G, 3G and 4G, but they began to feel ill within 24 hours of activating 5G. The studyThe Swedish study is particularly innovative because it documents the health effects of 5G radiation in real conditions of use, while until now there were only studies on the biological effects of the different frequencies of 5G. The biological effects of radiation are not only related to the power density, which gives information about its intensity and is responsible for heating, but are also determined by the quality of the radiation, i.e. its pulsation, polarization and remodulation. The most common symptoms that were found in the people in question were sleep disturbances, tiredness, headaches, irritability, concentration problems, short-term memory impairment and skin problems. These are the same symptoms described more than 50 years ago as microwave syndrome or radiofrequency sickness. In all cases observed, the radiation levels were lower than the levels considered safe by international standards; these in fact protect only from the effects of immediate heating of radiation, i.e. thermal effects, and not from other biological effects that are due to the interference of the external electromagnetic field with that of living systems, and therefore non-thermal effects. Confirming the role of 5G radiation is also the observation that irradiated subjects, once moved to another house with lower radiation levels, felt better; the symptoms eased and in most cases disappeared completely after a short period. In Italy, exposure limits are measured on an average of 24 hours and not 6 minutes, as is the case throughout the world. The 6-minute interval is the biological time necessary for cells to dissipate the heat produced by radiofrequency radiation through blood circulation. It is therefore a time necessary to protect cells from the effects of heating produced by the electromagnetic field. This choice was made in 2012 by the Monti Government, which increased the average measurement of radiofrequency radiation from 6 minutes to 24 hours, with the aim of diluting the measured values ​​and effectively increasing the limits of radiofrequency radiation. It is therefore clear that, with the growing use of these technologies, studies conducted by third-party bodies with respect to the Regional Administration are necessary, in the name of transparency and full accessibility of information to the community, in order to guarantee the population clear information, especially in the case of installation of new antennas near schools, hospitals and residential areas. Furthermore, the European Council itself, with a recommendation of 12 July 1999, in act 519 EC, provided at point 6 that Member States should promote research programmes in order to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendations and efforts of community and international research. With this motion, we therefore ask the Regional Government to activate, through funding to be explicitly provided for this purpose, a system of overall system study and monitoring of the impact on human health and on the environment of the entire system of infrastructures, networks and their emissions that will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, in order to guarantee and protect the health of the Aosta Valley people."

47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,4,4159,"Our group shares the need for digitalization that exists for our country and obviously also for our region. The spread of ultra-wideband throughout the national territory, both with fiber and with 5G, where an alternative is not possible, can serve to fill a gap, that of the Digital Divide which is undoubtedly a gap in our territory. But this must happen, in our opinion - or rather, it had to happen - without changes to the limits of exposure and precautionary attention in the face of risks or potential health risks that, with the increase, can obviously manifest themselves. Currently the limit has been set at 15 Volts per meter, by the competition decree in 2023, and previously it was 6 Volts per meter, so we are talking about more than doubling, and it is a limit that has generated quite a few controversies, because there is no valid reason to raise the value of attention for electromagnetic fields generated by high frequencies, other than the economic one, obviously on the part of telecommunications operators, who intend to save on the costs of their infrastructures. It is a threshold that has been assumed without a real scientific basis and there are strong concerns that have been expressed from many sides, truly many; I will mention only one, because it is the one that, among the many that I have read, also seemed most convincing to me and that is that of Dr. Belpoggi who was for a long time the scientific director of the Ramazzini Institute in Bologna which, as we know, is an institute that deals with cancer prevention. She is currently the scientific director of ISDE, the Association of Doctors for the Environment. Dr. Belpoggi, in a recent publication, stated: ""What will change is the power density, that is, the energy absorbed by our body, which will increase sixfold. Today, Italy wanted to align itself with other European countries, raising its limit, but then why hasn't it also aligned itself with the measurement times? It's true that the limit considered safe is 61 Volts per meter, so we are at 15, which is much lower, so theoretically we should be calm, but the fact is that in other European countries, which also have higher limits than the Italian one, these values ​​were measured at the maximum peaks. In Italy, however, they are measured throughout the day, day and night, so the average is also taken into account during the night hours, where telecommunications traffic, as we know, is, if not zero, almost zero"". So what's happening? That the data, in some way, is distorted. From this it is clear that our body, or that of those who are exposed to these peaks, has a higher frequency, I think there is no doubt about this. At the moment, electromagnetic waves remain a topic that is still, in our opinion, too little investigated. Some in-depth studies have been done, but we believe that they are not - on a general level, I mean - sufficient, because being exposed 24 hours a day, especially for some categories of people, I am thinking of children, the elderly, pregnant women, can be dangerous; I use ""Can"" because we do not have very certain data, but it is something that a whole series of scientists tell us, and so why not replace, for example, the large antennas - which have a concentration - with a series of smaller antennas also to dilute this exposure? We could have maintained the 6 Volts that we had until before the change in the situation, but what was needed to maintain them? A very high expense was needed, which has been estimated between 3 and 4 billion a year, a cost that the operators do not want to sustain. So let's welcome the commitment of this motion, which essentially asks for what? It asks for an in-depth analysis and monitoring of the impact on health. We believe that it is right that an activity of this type be activated, even in our region, precisely because this impact of 5G technology is considered controversially by some and others, but having an in-depth analysis can still help to clarify. We will therefore vote on the motion."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,5,109,"Councilor Baccega has booked, followed by Councilor Lucianaz. Councilor Baccega, you have the power."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955,M,FI,6,1424,"English: We read with great attention the motion that was presented by the two opposition groups and that brought us back to the motion that we brought to the attention of the Council last May, identifying in Terna's paths the will and the need to carry out a verification and a series of in-depth studies. Also in the Municipality of Gignod, we had evaluated two different situations, one that crossed the Municipalities from Charvensod to Aymavilles and the other that concerned precisely the antenna that will have to be positioned in the Municipality of Gignod; in that motion we had actually asked for an in-depth study, identifying ARPA as the entity that could give us important information regarding a study that must, in our opinion, be done. The commitment therefore that the motion brings to the attention of the Council, that is to carry out an in-depth study on the health of the entire system of infrastructures and networks and their emissions, which will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G network infrastructures, is certainly in line with what we think. It is certainly a matter of going deeper and it is above all a matter of giving a minimum of security also to the populations that are in some way close to these plants and that are sometimes solicited by information that can also be misleading. May science give us concrete answers regarding these paths. We will vote with conviction for this motion."

47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963,M,RV,8,11501,"I appreciated the speeches of Councilors Manfrin and Minelli, a sign that they have carefully prepared themselves on this complicated topic, and it would be appropriate for many Councilors here in this chamber to deal with it at least a little. I would also like to thank Baccega for his speech. I supported this motion - it could not be otherwise - and in doing so I am addressing in particular the majority of the Council, which is so sensitive to the issues of health and the ecosystem, so resilient in fighting their battle in the name of a cleaner and healthier environment; in particular, responsible fathers who are concerned about the future of future generations. I wanted to tell you that electromagnetic fields are one of the most widespread environmental pollutants, rapidly increasing in the environment, and that they are capable of biological modifications on cells and living organisms, including humans. Magnetic fields are natural, as we know, they control all the vital processes of living beings, therefore molecular movements, cellular oscillations, ionic interactions. Electromagnetic fields are produced by nature, and I am talking about cosmic rays, light energy, geomagnetism of the earth and living beings themselves. The fact is that until 1940 the natural pulsed background was 0.0002 Volts/meter, but in the last century there has been a huge entry of artificial fields at low and high frequencies, so radio antennas, telephones, electric cables, lamps, household appliances, power lines etc. etc., at high frequency, at low frequency, at low frequency but high intensity, etc. etc., the subject is very complex. The level of radiofrequency radiation since 1940, or rather, let's make it shorter, from 1985 to 2005, in 20 years, the level of radiofrequency radiation in industrialized countries has increased 5 thousand times, so 5 thousand times more radiation than human beings, like all living beings, receive. Will it do well? The 5G system was born in the last century in the USA from a research of the military industry for the guidance of tanks, drones, missiles, 3D image visualizations, it works with elements emitting high frequency waves, in the 700 MHz and 27 GHz bands, but it will soon reach 86 GHz, impressive things, with Phased array antennas, which are phased array vectors, I won't make it more difficult, but here is the problem that we would have to deepen the fixed geometry of the currently existing 3G networks, while the 5G network requires a different geometry. All this to say that we are installing a 5G on the fixed geometry of the 3G, this is naturally underused, but these are topics that we hope to address on site with the technicians. In all this, the 5G will operate with much higher frequencies than those used so far and will add to the fields of the current 2G, 3G and 4G, making it difficult for the ARPA to measure the electromagnetic field. It will be necessary to install numerous micro repeaters in urban areas: 250 antennas per square mile are calculated, which corresponds to one antenna every 100 m² approximately, remember, there will be one antenna every 100 m². Today's news: in Milan, a thousand street lamps will see the installation of small cells, which colleague Manfrin was talking about, installed on public lighting poles, A2A will take care of it. What's happening? That the small cells on the street lamps will be at the beginning of a process that will lead to the network, naturally more powerful, more widespread to improve the connection, but residents are already collecting signatures, because this is the first step towards a Smart City model, naturally this to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. But what's happening elsewhere? In Arezzo on October 8, 2024, so I'm talking about a little over a month ago, the Municipality made an about-face. The Municipality of Arezzo has proceeded to draft an order of cancellation ex officio in self-protection regarding the installation of the new radio base station for cellular telephony. The act was consequently entrusted to the technical opinion that highlighted the prevalence of the protection of public health over the provision of mobile telephony services, moreover the area was already covered. ""The antenna must be dismantled"", these are the words of the Municipality, the lack of urgency and non-deferrability were highlighted, as prerequisites for the release of the authorization and the unavailability of the company to identify a different solution forced them precisely tothis decision. It is therefore decided to proceed with the official cancellation of the authorization act previously granted and, consequently, to order the restoration of the state of the places. The antenna was taken and taken away. Following the example of the Mayor of Cassano Ionio, it is worth remembering: he issued an order with which he requested a halt to the work, pending the carrying out of all the checks necessary to ensure the protection of the health of the population. In Tuscany, you know it well, on September 22nd, so not even two months ago, the resolution of the Regional Council, signed by the Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, I repeat: the Regional Councilor for the Environment and the Councilor for Health, certainly more attentive to the health of their fellow citizens than other mountain areas that we know well, allocated a sum of 222 thousand euros to conduct what is perhaps the first scientific research conducted at a public level, at least in Italy. Tuscany has decided to conduct a study on 5G, six provincial capitals of about 100 thousand inhabitants, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Florence, Prato and Arezzo, or rather, some of much more than 100 thousand, will try to understand what the link is between the tumors suffered by the population, especially children, and the electromagnetic fields generated by the base stations that are springing up everywhere in Tuscany. Up to now the scientific community, as my colleagues who preceded me claimed, has only investigated the aspect of electromagnetic fields, that is, the thermal aspect. The aspect on biological tissues is very different. There will be the two regional agencies that are involved. ARPA Toscana is responsible for measuring exposure to pollution from superfast broadband; among its tasks: analyzing the limits and development scenarios of the 5G network; developing a mathematical model that allows the prediction on an urban scale of the levels of exposure present in the provincial capitals; measuring exposure with the control units already in place and purchasing others; carry out checks on existing 5G systems, possibly from different operators, and on those under construction that are being installed; apply special broadband dosimeters to the systems to measure exposure and evaluate exposure levels where it is highest and where the population density is highest, especially in areas where there are schools, with the presence of children. The ARS, the Regional Health Agency, will instead be responsible for: health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance in cities where slightly higher levels of electromagnetic fields are recorded, the estimates can also be refined within homes and schools; estimate the possible associations between exposure to electromagnetic fields and diseases. ""Based on the limited scientific literature available,"" says the ARS, ""it is planned to focus attention on the child population, as they are more susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic pollution."" What happens to children? It happens that EMFs, that is, electromagnetic fields, have no problem crossing the human body, as demonstrated by the images obtained from magnetic resonance radiology equipment, which show the entry of the field into the human skull upon contact, for example, with a cell phone. This dynamic is at the basis of the pathogenesis of acoustic nerve tumors and areas of brain tissue exposed to the side of contact with the mobile phone. The impressive thing is that in adults, the penetration is a few centimeters, while in a child it passes almost completely through the brain, naturally having a more fragile, lighter base. Doctor Gandus, who was connected recently with Aosta, on the occasion of an evening dedicated precisely to the subject, maintained that the increase in childhood brain tumors is being found in the 2000s and probably one of the causes could be precisely electromagnetic waves. The studies - they were cited by the colleague - are endless, we are talking about more than 10 thousand studies, and we cite the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the study by Prof. Hardell, the National Toxicology Program, the Ramazzini Institute was also cited, etc. etc., but we also have the sentences in court: the TAR of Lazio in 2019 and the TAR of Monza in March 2019 attested the link between electromagnetic fields and cancer beyond any other.reasonable doubt. What is happening here in the Aosta Valley, instead? Twice, the Environment Councilor replied to me that the data correspond to what the literature and recent studies have documented, but the problem is that there is this institute that carried out these measurements, the ICNIRP, International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection, and it established 61 Volts/meter as the non-worrying level, and it is the measure adopted at a European level. The problem is that this institute is considered an authority only by the European Commission, which has given this small private association from Bavaria the task of drawing up the guidelines for limiting exposure. The task was assigned in 1997 and in 1998 these measurements were already released, that is 61 Volts/meter, but the studies - I spoke of more than 10 thousand studies worldwide - support something very different, and that is that already at 0.2 Volts/meter there is interaction with human tissue, so there is certainly a lot to do, there is a lot to study in depth. The result is that, in addition to this disaster on land, the 5G project will also come from space. A launch into orbit of at least 20 thousand satellites is planned that will cover the earth with adjustable bands from the stratosphere, each one will emit 5 million watts on the ground that will connect to the billions of objects of the Internet of Things, we are talking about cars, televisions, sensors, computers and tablets, it is estimated that already in 2020 there were over 20 billion of these objects connected, making the environment where we live a real microwave oven 24 hours a day, with no escape, without the possibility of turning it off or hiding somewhere else. So let's welcome, let's hope for a little, a little - it doesn't require much - common sense from this Government, let's welcome a more in-depth analysis: I must admit that the President of the Third Commission, to whom I asked for the possibility of obtaining hearings by the scientific world in this chamber, has taken action and we should soon agree on these meetings. The request is that the scientific world be listened to and not only the highly respected technicians of ARPA, for whom we have all the due respect, but here we have scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to this research. We have scientists, we have doctors, who daily confront this problem. I would really like to understand what could be the impediment to seriously delve into this topic."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,9,154,"Are there any other interventions in the general discussion? I do not see any other requests, I close the general discussion. For the Government, replies Councilor Caveri."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958,M,UV,10,4011,"This time it's my turn because we're talking about pylons, as well as talking about 5G technology. I've heard the well-known theories of those who are against 5G, it's an interesting, anti-modernist movement, which is connected to other anti-modernist theories. I remember the one that said that those who got the vaccine would die, now, making horns, I don't want to die at the end of my speech, but it's quite clear that there are contradictions that I would like to say right away. I understand the position of Councilor Lucianaz, who has always fought, and we must also acknowledge the technical competence that would make the physics degree of colleague Lavevaz envious, but I find that there is a contradiction in the colleagues of the League and in the colleagues of Forza Italia, because it was your Governments, and in particular the Meloni Government, that increased the rate of electromagnetism - as my colleague Minelli recalled with the date of 2023 - just as it is your Government that went back on a legislative decree that would have given some chance to the Municipalities to at least move those pylons that will also be placed in the Aosta Valley. I only have to correct Councilor Minelli: 5G are small systems, the technology is very different. There will be more small pylons compared to the large pylons we have today. So it is difficult today, Councilor Manfrin, to hear the Aosta Valley League - I imagine in a logic of federalism, which I appreciate - saying things that are contrary to what the Government says. The Government has, in fact, liberalized the positioning of pylons, today no one can do anything, neither the Region, nor the municipal master plans, and we will see how the Arezzo issue ends, because it is in the hands of the administrative justice. With the latest regulations that on the one hand have increased the limits of electromagnetic fields in Italy, which remain - I also say this to Councilor Minelli - lower than the European average, but above all with the law converting a recent decree law, there is this provision: in order to allow the timely achievement of digital transformation objectives for the interventions of the 5G Italy Plan for the creation of new suitable network infrastructures, practically nothing can be done anymore. We do not have Municipalities that today say: ""Instead of putting the pylon there, we put it there"", they have no power. This was a political clarity. I repeat, those who are against 5G, do so legitimately, I am surprised that those who today with a State law have favored a massive movement of these pylons, today in this chamber say the opposite. Then, for goodness sake, I repeat, I imagine that there is a local respect and I would not want it to be just a wink to those who are against 5G. Because there is no need for a specific study to be done, I am not the one saying this, I obviously have studied it in depth with the technicians of the Department, but above all with the ARPA, which is the one that must take the measurements, which must correspond to those limits that, as I said before, have increased. According to the ARPA it is useless, because it itself is part of an Italian ARPA system that continues to have a constant exchange of information regarding the scientific research that is done and as you know there is also a central body called ISPRA, also in connection with all the institutes that are doing the research and that largely deny some of the things that you said today, because to date the official results are those that regulate national legislation and we do not have, as autonomy, a possibility of changing technical standards that even have a European value. According to ARPA, it is more than enough to be part of this system, today it would be specific studies in Valle d'Aosta and money wasted, because all the institutes of which it is part, with very broad collaborations, our ARPA, are doing it with great effectiveness, therefore we will abstain."

You tell me that nothing more can be done, we take note of that, but in our opinion, an in-depth study with respect to the populations that have the Superphénix passing over their roofs... something will have to be seen and done because, in my opinion, there will be some problems. We will also carry out in-depth studies. I did not speak and I did not say that Forza Italia is against 5G, you cannot put that in my mouth, I simply said that for the sake of the health of the population it would be appropriate to carry out in-depth studies, and that is why we want to vote on this motion."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,13,115,"Councilor Manfrin, you have the power. Councilor Manfrin is the promoter of the motion, so not 5 minutes but..."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,14,6464,"Thank you, Councilor Caveri, for your answer that, for once, honestly, I expected to be different, precisely because I know that you are a person who prepares and who delves into the issues; instead you objectively fell into an answer that is more obvious than Mickey Mouse jokes, and I regret this for two reasons. The first is that you tried to try to paint the people who raise a request, which is not to return to the Stone Age, to live like the Mormons, but is a request - as was correctly said by colleagues from Forza Italia, as well as by other colleagues who preceded me during the illustration of this initiative, during the general discussion - to have protections and to do in-depth studies from the point of view of health. English: I am not known for being one of those who want to plant daisies on the highway, so I cannot be accused of being someone who hates modernity, I certainly hate impositions, you know that you and I think differently about mandatory vaccinations for example, I am for freedom, you are for forcing people, under penalty of social and work-related death, they are questions of choice: he was very happy that there were obligations for people who did or did not do a certain health treatment and this marks the difference between us which is absolutely legitimate, as you have highlighted. However, if you had had a less ideological and more substantive approach - because you are capable of doing this type of analysis, absolutely, certainly much more than the undersigned who has done less politics than you - and had limited yourself to reading the text, you would have seen that there is no conspiracy theory here, no flat-eartherism, no hypothesis of erasing any technological network in our region, but a very simple request, that is, to do studies and delve into the issue of the potential risks of the network. You raised the political issue and I am happy that you did, I will obviously answer you in two parts. The first is that if you go and look, despite the increase that you mentioned, which is absolutely correct, Italy remains one of the European countries with the lowest emissions, with the lowest limits, so evidently this increase was made, but keeping in mind that it was necessary to remain within certain standards, obviously receiving criticism, which you rightly recalled - and I think I don't have to explain to you, especially since you had a cohabitation in the Council with political movements, with ideas that you did not share - but sometimes, when you govern, you also have to find a compromise and sometimes you share things that perhaps you do not share, I am not saying that this has happened but I am speaking in general. I must tell you another thing, however, Councilor Caveri, that on the political issue you are forgetting a small passage, that is that this same commitment and this same study was decided by the Tuscany Region and not with a motion, but with a Council resolution. The last time I checked, and I check every morning, the Tuscany Region also had its own regional agency for control. The moment you tell us that the ARPA controls are sufficient, you tell us that the Tuscany Region is a Region of reckless madmen - who have a regional agency that doesn't work, flat-earthers, who probably even walk around with tinfoil over their heads so as not to be psychologically manipulated... - or we can accept the fact that perhaps, having a further study and further investigation, can only do good, because maybe it also supports what you say, maybe it confirms that there is no problem, that everything is fine, or maybe not. This reminds me a little of what happened this morning and what happened last week during the Commission: we asked to have a hearing with the business categories to get their opinion, but no, they said no, because they prefer to avoid the risk that someone might deny what you say or cast doubt on it, and here I feel like I'm in exactly the same situation. People are afraid to do an in-depth analysis because maybe the results are not what they expected. Now you see, Councillor, we approached the debate with the utmost openness, I think you can give me credit for that, I didn't raise political issues, I didn'tI have raised questions, flat-earther crusades, I have simply raised a question which is what you see, there is somewhere raised an obvious possibility that this could be harmful to health, because either we imagine that everything is always fine, or, if we want to put science first, as you have rightly done several times on several topics, we can imagine that science often questions itself and has doubts - it is the essence of a demonstration - so having had this technology for a short time, even the long-term effects of this technology are not known. If what you say is actually true, then the recommendation of the European Council of 12 July 1999, where it is asked to promote research programmes in order to improve knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendation of international community research efforts, would make no sense, probably it was a flat-earther Europe that does not believe in progress and that wants to reduce us all to bringing back the stone age or perhaps there are legitimate concerns. Perhaps, at this point, the Region, which is governed by the Democratic Party, will actually be a reckless Region, and then I suggest you perhaps communicate this to your colleagues, saying that your colleagues in Tuscany are all crazy and don't understand anything or perhaps even raise doubts. Raising doubts, having doubts probably also leads to having results that can confirm or deny what we hypothesize, on one side and the other. I believe that this is a doubt that can come to everyone. You believe you have infused science and say: ""No, it's not like that"", we're sorry for you, but for us it's not like that. Obviously we will not withdraw this motion, clearly we are anxious to see how the vote will be distributed, we have expressed our position and I think it is clear."

You are, in my opinion of course, and I agree with what I say, the disappointment of a people, because asking to delve into a topic like that of electromagnetic waves, on which all the communities... I mentioned last time the communities of the Ligurian Levant, where the Ligurian ANCI took action to ask for further information, and, among other things, the President of the Liguria Region had difficulties precisely on these aspects. We ask you to at least discuss it in the Commission, which among other things are classified, so the data cannot even be released, not even that... I mentioned Article 191 of the European Treaty, so dear to Councilor Caveri, which puts the protection of health before economic interests; we all know this, there are large, enormous economic interests, well, let's try to protect them, some are more convinced than others, perhaps no one is against progress. Then if I participate in demonstrations with the No Vax I do so willingly, I don't go to see who you hang out with, and in any case I don't care at all. The point is that I support the freedom of every citizen of the Aosta Valley to express themselves and I also go to listen to them, look at that. The fact that recent studies, certified, etc. continue to be cited... I continue to reiterate that the Institute of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Protection from Non-Ionizing Radiation that I told you about before, is a private agency, with limited activity, made up of a non-institutional Commission of twelve members, Bavarian, in which, moreover, no doctor was present - and I address my colleague Councilor Barmasse, who told me that there is no doctor in this hearing. Not even here in this Commission is there a doctor, look at that, and yet the ARPA, like all other political governments, relies on this study. You may not know, I'll tell you this too: in 2020 the Court of Appeal of Turin denounced the conflict of interest of the Bavarian ICNIRP that I told you about before, defining it as ""a private organization, whose guidelines have great economic and strategic importance for the telecommunications industry"", with which several members of the ICNIRP have ties through consultancy relationships. The Court of Appeal of Turin also says, ruling from 2020: ""It is evident that these subjects should refrain from evaluating the effect on health, which ICNIRP itself has declared safe and not harmful to health"". These are rulings of Italian courts. You smile, as usual continue in this spirit. You are a real disappointment."
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,17,46,Councilor Minelli for voting declarations.
47991,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,18,3819,"To declare my vote and to confirm what I said previously, that is, that we will support this motion, but also to make a consideration more than anything else on the response given by Councilor Caveri, that is, the very heart of the motion, that is, the need or not to do a specific study. The Councilor says: ""There is no need to do a specific study, I'm not saying it, ARPA says it, it is completely useless because ARPA is within a national system of which ISPRA is also a part and therefore there are already studies that speak, that document a series of things"". I think we all know that ARPA is within the SNPA system, that is, the federal system that includes twenty-one environmental agencies, because there are the two autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, and which rightly also includes ISPRA, but what does this system do? It is a system that collects the studies that the individual agencies do, and then obviously also elaborates some guidelines, gives indications to the other agencies, but I don't really understand why our ARPA couldn't, in our territory, do a small study with the characteristics that we have highlighted and then obviously share it, within the system, reason with the others, because normally this is what they do, with the supervision of ISPRA, with the relationships that exist between the various agencies. The motivation leaves me a little perplexed, that we can't change things is fine, it can absolutely be accepted, but contributing to a scientific study on a territory that is limited (which perhaps could also lend itself to making assessments to share and perhaps to validate or not validate through the other agencies that can do the same action in their own territory) seems to me to be a fairly sensible thing. Honestly, it is something that has left me a little perplexed as a motivation. I would also like to make a clarification, but I think that the Councilor, when he spoke, was not referring to us so much, then it seems to me that he also made it quite explicit regarding the issue that there are people who are against 5G. I specified, intervening, that from our point of view this is a technology that should not be demonized, that both fiber and 5G can be useful to fill the gap that exists, that is, the fact that our country is still poorly digitalized, but this should not be done at the expense of what could be the protection of citizens' health. I do not pretend to say that it is absolutely negative, I reported opinions that are the opinions of scientists, and I believe that they also have a very respectable curriculum, but then, precisely to arrive at a definition and a closing of the circle, all the studies that can be done, in my opinion, are useful and can also be used for a broader debate that obviously does not only involve our region. It is obvious that we are within a very complex country system, but I certainly agree with what the Councilor said about the fact that, at the level of government decisions, moving the limits from 6 Volts/meter to 15 is a decision that was taken at a central level, so it is obvious that choices were made on this. Then everyone can have concerns, which are absolutely legitimate, and want to go into more detail, I think it has been explained, this does not take away the fact that our country was in a better situation compared to other European countries - certainly from my point of view - because those 6 Volts per meter were, from the point of view of health protection, better than 15, but this was not the case, it was decided differently and there are obviously responsibilities on this."

47992,XVI,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,2,1921,"The question time concerns the intense sponsorship and promotion activity of CVA, there is no shortage of money, but, being a public company, the money belongs to the entire community, so the question that arises is whether all this action has a valid motivation or not. We asked for the data of the sponsorships of the contributions between 2021 and 2023, the considerable amount is close to a million euros, but above all some surprising things emerge, such as the payments to Confindustria Valle d'Aosta for a conference (it is a bit strange that Confindustria was not able to do it alone ...), there are a total of 180 thousand euros in favor of the Municipality of Courmayeur and the Courmayeur Foundation, while for many other Municipalities the figure is zero. There are contributions to subjects totally external to the Valle d'Aosta, to pro loco in the province of Avellino and Viterbo and then we know that there are denials and rejected requests. We therefore want to better understand how it is operating and we want to understand what sense there is in the recent dinner invitation for three journalists from each newspaper operating in the Valley. An opportunity to get to know each other and to explain, it is essentially said in the invitation, but, if CVA wants to explain its position, it should call a press conference and not a dinner. It is an initiative, in our opinion, a bit clumsy, which, among other things, embarrasses many people. CVA is at the center of an important discussion on its role and operations and the proof comes from the surprising speed with which the IV Commission was called for next Thursday, with the hearing of the CVA leaders, we do not know exactly why, given the vagueness of the agenda and above all the many arrears of the Commission. The CVA issue is a delicate matter, it is a company on which the media must be able to speak in total freedom and without conditioning and that dinner invitation structured in this way seems to us an inappropriate form of pressure. I await the answers."

47992,XVI,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,4,1045,"The questioner asks the Regional Government to know on the basis of which criteria CVA S.p.A. proceeds to sponsorships or donations to dinner invitations. In relation to this question posed by the question, CVA communicates that, as regards the first part, the company has had specific regulations for some years. On the company's website there is a specific section which indicates the methods of presentation and disbursement of sponsorships and donations and above all the evaluation criteria which concern two macro items: the territorial value of the proposal and the social and impact value. As regards the second part of the question, the criteria on the basis of which CVA proceeds to dinner invitations, CVA highlights that dinners are part of a typical external relations activity of a large industrial group which is substantiated in discussions with stakeholders, among which certainly include representatives of the world of communication in the reference territory."

47992,XVI,"FINANZA REGIONALE E LOCALE, Partecipazioni azionarie regionali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,6,1085,"English: We have viewed the CVA website, we have seen the page you mentioned, sponsorships and grants, among other things, then from the data it is not clear why some things ended up in one sector rather than another, but above all it is not clear who is part of this Sponsorship Committee and how the body that decides on the contributions operates, but, beyond this, what we want to underline is that CVA is a company of great importance, created to manage a heritage of hydroelectric power plants purchased by the Region, a strategic company that in recent years has distanced itself from the mission it had and also from the transparency that should characterize a public company. We know, we have said it many times, we do not agree with certain methods and certain choices, but it is serious, in our opinion, that the Council refuses to address the problem and take control of the situation considering that the situation is now quite out of control. On the issue of stakeholders, we learn that the press are stakeholders of CVA!!"
47993,XVI,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,74,Item no. 8.02. Councillor Aggravi has asked to speak and has the floor.
47993,XVI,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,2,1297,"This question requiring an immediate response is prompted by the news that has emerged in recent days in the press regarding the fact that the Council of State has suspended as a precautionary measure, at least until the conclusion of a judgment on the merits of the TAR, a passage on the ministerial decree of suitable areas. The disputed part is that, we could say in summary, relating to the possibilities that the Regions and autonomous Provinces would have in identifying, precisely, the suitable areas, this to dissuade regional legislators from adopting, pending the judgment, laws that restrict the number of suitable areas. Let us remember, if I have updated data, but Table A of the decree should not be changed, therefore it identifies the objectives of additional power, in 2030 it should even reach 328 megawatts in Valle d'Aosta, in particular within the decree there was a time frame for the application by regional law by the Regions. As far as the Regions with special statutes and autonomous provinces were concerned, there was the safeguard clause. We ask the competent Assessor what is the current status of application and achievement of the objectives set by the decree Suitable Areas in Valle d'Aosta."
47993,XVI,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,33,The floor goes to Councillor Bertschy.
47993,XVI,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,UV,4,2358,"Given the time of question time, I will not read the entire long answer but I will try to be exhaustive in listing the main points and obviously available to complete the information if necessary. The decree in question, the one that gave six months to adopt with a regional law the suitable and unsuitable areas, saw on our part the institution through resolution 1193 of the technical table and the control room that must lead to a bill to be approved by the Council by the end of the year, also with the approval of the Council, times that obviously all the Regions found excessively short, but in any case we all got to work and before this ruling we were ready to accept a first draft of the law, which, with respect to the calendar given by the resolution, had to arrive at the proposal of the Council by November 22. English: The ruling of the Council of State changes the conditions for developing the legislation and above all creates an impediment that is currently suspended until February 5, when there will be an expression of merit and obviously creates a situation that does not put us in a position to complete the work as Regions. There are two aspects that the Regions have brought to the attention of the Government: a request for a 90-day extension of the deadline set by the decree expiring on December 30, 2024. An amendment has been presented that we hope will be accepted, precisely to give time to complete this verification and in recent days, both the Technical Commission and the Conference of the Regions have asked the Ministry to be able to have a technical assessment of the impediments that the Council of State has given with respect to article 20, paragraph 8, of Legislative Decree 199/2021. This is for the more bureaucratic administrative part and also of a legal nature. I undertake - there will be a meeting of the technical tables at the beginning of the week - to give you, also for information, what will emerge from this work at the technical table. Compared to the objectives, at the moment about 20 megawatts have been installed, over the year about another 3.4 megawatts, however, what is missing from the GSE - and I finish, I conclude, I apologize for having been long - the valorization of hydroelectric production that we know can be differentiated from that of photovoltaic."

47993,XVI,"ENERGIA, Risparmio energetico e fonti alternative",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,6,934,"Thank you Councilor. I realize that time does not allow a complete examination of a complex situation and especially of a very complex regulation, but we wanted to understand why the timing was at least the original one, so we hope that the derogation passes anyway. Of course, the more you look at this decree, at least personally, the more doubts there are, especially on the methods of defining the power objectives, but we had also already, among other things, spoken about it during the discussion of the energy plan. Having said that, we thank you for your willingness to keep the Council informed and we will also try to understand what the evolutions will be at a national level, because, among other things, also seeing the objectives of the PNIEC (National Energy and Climate Plan) and what have instead been the requests and also the authorization times of the plants, the mountain to climb is very high."
47994,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,74,Item no. 8.03. Councillor Manfrin has asked to speak and has the floor.
47994,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,2,1524,"With this initiative we intend to report a rather unpleasant incident that occurred to a user of the Variney facility, a user who unfortunately was seen for reasons that are not well explained, someone inside the facility tried to justify a treatment that objectively deeply affected the person in question, so he was shaved completely against his will, someone tried to justify it as an action due to personal hygiene, too bad that the haircut had taken place only ten days before, so clearly that hygiene cannot be justified, others explained more realistically that it was an act of prank, internal to the facility, to prepare him for a hypothetical marriage with another user guest of the same facility to whom he had obviously approached, because she was one of the few people with whom he could talk. Obviously all this put the person in a deep state of humiliation and prostration and rightly the family, which is an attentive and present family, reported and highlighted a deep discomfort for this action. We have reported several problems in this facility and highlighted the fact that this is absolutely not the treatment to be provided to a vulnerable person and we ask if any actions have been taken to ascertain what happened in the facility and, in particular, what measures have been adopted to avoid the occurrence of the actions described."

47994,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Assistenza socio-sanitaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,4,1572,"The Local Health Authority, as part of its monitoring of the activity and services provided at the Variney facility, promptly verified the report and informed that the incident dates back to November 14th during the morning shift. The event refers to the actions implemented by the facility staff following the need to proceed with a specific care requirement of a guest. After washing the head, scales and scabs were present that prevented the effective application of the moisturizing oil. A nurse therefore thought it was best to cut the hair to facilitate the application of the moisturizing oil on the skin. The day after the family members requested clarification, they were called to a meeting and given the necessary explanations. The family stated that they understood and accepted the clarifications. The episode is therefore configured as a legitimate action within the scope of an assessment of the state of health not affected by environmental conditions or recreational presuppositions, as feared by the request. Instead, we find it unusual again to use the council instruments to reach such a level of inspection detail, because this inspection level could almost make one think that this management level is up to you and/or her, but no one can be so naive. So perhaps the motivation that would remain is to create moments of political visibility. We are certain that, if your reply is calm, this is not the case."

My response is not serene for any reason, because obviously the family has not accepted the explanation that was provided for any reason. I will add some details, so you will be aware: the perpetrators of the action themselves telephoned the family directly to apologize for what happened. It seems that there were several meetings, always within the facility, to try to understand what happened. The fact that you limit yourself to providing, as always, the explanation that justifies a certain type of action that is absolutely obscene, I believe is instead a serious way of shirking the responsibilities that are placed upon you, for which I am seriously dissatisfied, we are seriously dissatisfied with your response and obviously we will not stop here."

47996,XVI,"TRASPORTI E VIABILITÀ, Autostrade e trafori alpini",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,2,2111,"English: The questioners ask whether, to date, following discussions with the company during the year, there are any new developments or positive solutions regarding the possible actions aimed at extending the agreement for the reduction of the motorway toll to the category B vehicles and whether the needs of Aosta Valley families with disabled people were also taken into account in the presentation of the request to the company, with the aim of overcoming these obstacles and therefore ensuring the inclusion of disabled people in the concessions. With respect to this question, there is currently no new developments regarding the extension of the agreement for the reduction of the motorway toll to category B vehicles. As we have already had the opportunity to share last February, this is a technical issue related to the height of the front axle of the vehicle, on which the concessionaires obviously cannot intervene, but above all it is an issue related to the setting of the concessions in question, which is however still linked to the identification of a fixed route and which in any case is subject to authorization from the Ministry of Transport currently valid for the period 2024-2026. The topic is not closed, in the sense that our intention is to review, in a comprehensive and improving perspective, the existing facilitation procedure in order to simplify it and to further implement the use of the motorway section compared to ordinary roads, with more flexible tariff concessions. This is one of the aspects also included in the regional transport plan, on which we will continue the discussion with the motorway concessionaires. As regards the aspect of people with particular difficulties, it should be highlighted that the existing concessions are linked to vehicles that fall within class A. Italian legislation exempts from payment only the vehicles of volunteer and rescue associations, but not those of people with particular difficulties or their families."

We wanted to understand if there were any new developments, we hope that the action that, as you told us, will be carried forward, or in any case the continuation that will be carried forward will be able to find or in any case elaborate a possibility and above all find a solution to a problem that is simple, but very complex to resolve."
47997,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,50,Point no. 10. The President of the Region responds.
47997,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,2,4272,"The Councilor requests the composition of the discussion table aimed at achieving the relocation at the Aosta Valley Health Authority at the entities of the single sector of OSS personnel with reduced working capacity, also the criteria and methods defined, the implementation of the method of the interested personnel, the number of notices of interested operators who have obtained the aforementioned mobility with the specification of the destination entity and whether the criteria and methods referred to in point 2 have also been extended to all the other categories of the sector. With respect to this interpellation, this is one of those cases in which the intentions, in the specific case those set out in the aforementioned motion of July 2021, then encounter obstacles in reality that are different from those imagined. Already in November 2022, following a similar question, an account was given of the difficulties that had emerged in following up on the commitment of the motion, first of all because, even if these are entities of the single sector, an agreement between the entities is still necessary to proceed with what is in any case a transfer of an individual contract, as provided for in Article 43, paragraph 4bis, of Regional Law 22/2010. A series of critical issues have emerged and have not yet been resolved which, at the moment, also considering that the Personnel Department has been absorbed by the planning and implementation of the competitions for the renewal of the 2022-2024 regional collective agreement for non-managerial staff of the single sector, have prevented the activation of the working table with the trade unions even though the Department itself has started working on a proposal in this direction. The issues to be resolved are: first of all, with reference to the economic treatment, the professional profile of OSS is classified in position B2S, while the other professional profiles of category B employed by the Regional Administration of the other entities of the sector are classified in economic position B2. For such OSS personnel, a reclassification in a lower economic position would therefore be determined, in light of which it is necessary to define whether the employee maintains the economic treatment of origin and in what way, or must accept the new economic treatment of the new classification position. The economic re-classification must be provided for by law, the contract not being sufficient. Secondly, mobility with a change of professional profile from social-health operator to assistant cannot be ordered ex officio in the face of a supervening total or partial unsuitability for the duties of OSS. In fact, these are very different professional profiles, for whose conversion an aptitude test for the role of the job would be necessary. Again: it must be taken into account that with the acceleration of the digitalization of the Public Administration, the professional and administrative profiles of the B2 position category, specialized operator, have necessarily evolved and today require much higher technical skills than ten years ago, so much so that the reform of the professional organization of Public Administrations, already introduced at state level and soon to be introduced at regional level, requires, as a requirement for access to category B, a diploma and no longer a middle school diploma. This is why the competition for the recruitment of personnel in the B-B2 positions category, with the professional profile of assistant, has been postponed to 2026, to avoid holding a competition today requiring, under current legislation, a qualification that is no longer adequate for the tasks and professional content that category B employees will be called upon to perform. In light of the above, it is therefore not easy to define today the rules for the mobility of personnel with a professional profile of OSS towards administrative profiles of the roles of the bodies of the single regional sector before having proceeded to define a new professional system and a new system of classification of personnel, also because hypothesizing mobility towards other professional profiles of the same category is not feasible given the limitations of the working capacities of the workers in question."

47997,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Personale medico e paramedico",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,4,2117,"I ask the President, since my colleagues have also asked, if it is possible to have the answer, because what certainly clearly emerges is that from 2021 to today nothing has been done and the critical issues that have emerged remain all - because, as you recalled, there had already been an initiative - on the table. What we highlight, however, is that over time there have been people in the OSS category who have been moved, for example, from structures, such as the J.B. Festaz Company, we talked about it right in the last Council, to the Hospital, perhaps even doing less heavy work, because we cannot say that every department has the same workload, because it is quite obvious that those who are in orthopedics will lift weights, those who are in an outpatient clinic will most likely do another type of work. What is required is whether they cannot be placed in the reception, in the switchboards, as always happened and as has happened over time on many occasions; if this is no longer possible, perhaps give the possibility of being able to move to structures that are less demanding from a certain point of view, even with respect to their workloads. What leaves me even more perplexed is the fact that it is enough to see the many resignations that have occurred and are occurring over time to understand that this professional figure, indispensable for the maintenance of any health structure, is somehow always given little consideration: therefore, battles are not fought to define the exhausting work of these figures, this is why they are not given the possibility of being relocated to perhaps less demanding jobs, when on other occasions we provide the staff as if nothing had happened and then a strike comes upon us or we receive resignations one after the other. I would therefore ask, from this point of view, if it is not feasible to move within the administrative structures, as the President told us, for all the obstacles that exist, to give these people the possibility of being able to access perhaps sectors and departments that are less demanding than those they have to serve."
47998,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Costituzione e funzionamento degli organi consiliari",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,50,Point no. 11. The President of the Region responds.
47998,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Costituzione e funzionamento degli organi consiliari",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,2,1939,"Councilor Aggravi asks whether an official response has been given to the letter cited in the introduction, and if so, with what content. With regard to the letter in question, it should be noted in this question that it was addressed by the President of CVA, in addition to the undersigned, to the President of the Regional Council, to the President of Finaosta and to Councilor Minelli, as correctly recalled by the interpellation itself. With this letter to the President of CVA, he intended to reiterate, with reference to the question of the PCP council group discussed in this chamber on May 22, the positions of the company with respect to the procedures for appointing the administrative and control bodies of the group company and the discipline of the related compensation. On these points, the President of CVA has punctually illustrated the legal motivations of the decisions taken, the strategic and operational assumptions that underlie these decisions, and the parameters used. Finally, the President of CVA highlighted the fact that the terminology used by the Councilor risks constituting reputational damage for CVA and damage to the operations of CVA EOS, as well as damage to the honorability and professionalism of the governing and control bodies of the company in question, representing the willingness, in compliance with the autonomy and reciprocal roles, to provide all the clarifications requested. The note therefore constituted in fact an explanation regarding the facts that had been questioned and contested by Councilor Minelli, as mentioned, during a previous council meeting and not a request to be answered. I therefore did not consider it necessary to respond to this letter, expecting instead a response from Councilor Minelli regarding what was argued by CVA, which indeed arrived, but in the form of a legal opinion and a press conference."

47998,XVI,"CONSIGLIO REGIONALE, Costituzione e funzionamento degli organi consiliari",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,4,1872,"Do you know why I asked you this question, Mr President? Basically for two reasons: the first, because, reading the contents of the letter or note of May 31 signed by the President of the CVA, in particular the conclusion of this letter, I finally understood that he was expecting a response not only from you or from individuals, but absurdly the response could have come from all four, because there is not actually a precise indication of the fact that possibly one of these or some of these were indicated for information, but all four are recipients, therefore you, the President of the Council Bertin, the President of Finaosta and the councilor Minelli, therefore, absurdly, you could have responded jointly all together, in fact ultimately the President of the CVA asks and awaits your kind response. I asked you out of fair consideration for your role as the final beneficial owner of the system of regional subsidiaries. The second point is instead a clarification by the undersigned, always on the motivation of the question, because, you see, I am not interested in the emoluments, which for me should always take into account the intercurrent relationships of risk and management complexity of the activities to be performed or the procedures for selecting administrators or the thicket of internal rules and regulations, on which I still reserve the right to study, but rather in the fact that certain situations, certain requests or answers, a certain nervousness at times in responding, I am not only talking about the political counterpart, often end up implying something else and this worries me much more because often the mystery or the unclear or the classified can generate reputational consequences much more important than a question or an interpellation. Good work."

The practices relating to the minors have not yet been completed. Contents and regulations are being defined. If approved by the competent bodies, it will be the University's responsibility to provide all the necessary details.

47999,XVI,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,49,"For the reply, the floor is given to Councilor Manfrin."
47999,XVI,"ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA, Università",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,4,3809,"Probably, if I had been in his position, to the second question, even without knowing exactly which direction it would have gone, I would have answered: what are the practical applications? ""None"", I would have answered like that, but I am me. I am obviously happy that there is still no information and I hope that this is just a ""Voice escaped from the Senate"". Allow me to provide a bit of context so at least we know what we are talking about, yesterday we talked about science, but, if there is a theory that frontally opposes science, it is the theory or, better, the ideology of gender, or gender, if you will. Years ago, this was quite evident to the point that some of its proponents tried with denialism to hide its existence, but then, by dint of talking about gender violence, gender discrimination, with fig leaves to mask the rainbow gender propaganda, the absurd theory came back through the window before it had even fully gone out the door. Now under what was somewhat defined during the interview the lofty name of gender studies ... this obviously unfortunately also peeps out in what should be the temple of knowledge, that is the University, and all the ambiguity of the courses that are established under this umbrella is in the absolutely non-univocal sense that the magical term gender, that is gender, which can mean different things, even opposites, but in any case is not attributable to the obvious scientific and anatomical sense of biological sex and this is a bit of the ambivalence on which it plays. This rather ideological and oriented perspective would be aimed at promoting at a cultural level an inclusive and non-discriminatory narrative and representation of gender identities, beautiful, even if in reality this does not mean anything. In the United States, from which unfortunately we take inspiration - now we hope that with the advent of Trump a certain quality of type of studies will no longer see the light -, there are many courses that refer to these theories, gender sensitive journalism, the social analysis of gender equality, gender language and language, gender perspective literatures, literatures and migrations and inequalities, gender statistics, gender economies, culture, politics and gender empowerment, the world, in short, reread in the light of the most famous and constructive gender theory on sexuality. Should this represent a cultural education or, more easily, and this is objectively a danger, a flattening, a formatting on mainstream thought? We believe that it is this second option. The doubt arises because gender, instead of the archaic scientific sex, is spoken of almost everywhere, and in the name of gender they want to unite the male and female bathrooms, they want to authorize the student to change his name based on intimate sensations or allow the male athlete, who declares he feels like a woman, to compete with biological ladies and young ladies. Every reference to events that occurred during the Olympics is purely intentional. If there are only two sexes, according to these theories, unfortunately we know this well, the genders would be dozens, perhaps hundreds and this based on purely subjective, arbitrary and undefined criteria, but then how can we do science without fixed points that delimit the field of science? How can we establish whether Mario Rossi is queer, gender free, asexual or simply non-binary? For some time now, the spread of gender theory has been supplanting biology and related sciences, as, among others, the atheist mathematician Piergiorgio Odifreddi or the feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero have also recognized. Let us hope that the University will soon return to its former splendor, that is, more Galilean science, less gender subculture."

48000,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Asili nido, ISTRUZIONE PUBBLICA",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,FP-PD,2,3720,"In answer to question no. 1, given that the question posed speaks in a generic way of projects, I provide some data focusing attention both on the projects included in the definition of childcare centers, and on the projects with funds allocated to local authorities in application of the multi-year national action plan for the integrated system. Childcare centers: to date, four childcare centers are active in three educational institutions: Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Mont-Emilius 3 Charvensod, Childcare Center of Jovençan, Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin, Gignod, Childcare Center of Roisan and Doues, Elio Reinotti, Pont-Saint-Martin, Childcare Center of Lillianes. As regards the multi-year national plan projects, this is DGR 134 of 12 February 2024. As foreseen by the aforementioned resolution of the Council, the projects that can be financed with state resources in the 2024-2025 financial year can be traced back to the following priorities: priority 1) projects for 0-6 year old childhood centers and educational continuity; priority 2) projects for 0-6 year old educational continuity, 9 projects financed for a total of €563,703.10 in the two-year period; priority 3) projects for the enhancement of kindergarten, 9 projects financed for a total of €204,217.44 in the two-year period; priority 4) building interventions on nurseries and kindergartens, 5 projects financed for a total of €157,645.38 in 2024; priority 5) purchases of furniture for nursery schools and kindergartens, 4 projects funded for a total of €143,627.63 in the two-year period. In question no. 2, it is necessary to specify that the children belonging to the age groups indicated should not be divided by school complex, since they are managed by early childhood services. It is assumed that reference is being made to the early childhood centers. The requested data are therefore the following: early childhood center of Jovençan, educational institution Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Mont-Emilius 3 of Charvensod number of children eight, 0-1 two children, 1-2 two children, 2-3 four children; early childhood center of Roisan, educational institution Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin-Gignod number of children seven, 0-1 none, 1-2 six children, 2-3 one child; Doues childcare centre, Unité des Communes Valdôtaines Grand-Combin-Gignod school institution number of children four, 0-1 two children, 1-2 one child, 2-3 one child; Lillianes childcare centre, Elio Reinotti school institution of Pont-Saint-Martin number of children 11, 0-1 one child, 1-2 eight children, 2-3 two children. Question no. 3: childcare centres. Childcare centres represent a significant way of implementing the integrated 0-6 education and instruction system. As indicated both at a regulatory level and at the level of accompaniment and support in schools for services through the 0.6 table and the reference bodies, in particular the Superintendency of Studies and the Department of Social Policies, the projects are being implemented respecting the sphere of professional competences of both segments and for the school part in compliance with the approval and formalization procedures within the competent collegiate bodies. Only two months from the start of the school year is too tight a timeframe to be able to make assessments supported by experience. The task of the 0-6 table will also be to collect elements to make appropriate assessments at an interinstitutional level. With regard to the multi-year national plan project DGR 134 of 12 February 2024, the projects are in the start-up phase; it will be the task of the 0-6 table to monitor and evaluate their significance and effectiveness."

We are referring to the construction site of the Arch of Augustus. During the last inspection, the topic of the guided visits provided for by the contract was addressed in order to define the calendar and the methods for carrying out this activity while respecting the safety of the route. The visits that will soon be scheduled have the purpose of making known the design path and the works in progress aimed at preserving the monument, for which they require a technical preparation time also in relation to the interferences with the works in progress. As regards question two, for the printing of the three-dimensional model, the 3D model and the point cloud useful for its construction were provided to the companies. The company is in the process of identifying the supplier for the construction. As regards question no. 3, the construction site sign indicates the figures required by law, but the work group that carried out the technical-administrative practice in the design phase and today in the execution phase is also composed of other professionals. In fact, in the design phase, for which the research, surveys, analyses carried out over the years by the Scientific Analysis structure were used, a special work group was created composed of the architect Cristina De La Pierre, superintendent now retired, also with the role of RUP in the design phase, Dr. Alessandra Armirotti, archaeologist of the Superintendency, architect Nathalie Dufour, Superintendency, the surveyor Salvatore Martino of the Superintendency, collaborator of the RUP, UNI BS for the creation of the BIM model, the colleagues of the Scientific Analysis Office of the Superintendency, the engineer Daniele Monaja for safety, and the company Koinè for the skills in restoration. In the execution phase, the Works Management Office is composed of Dr. Alessandra Armirotti, archaeologist of the Superintendence, scientific manager, architect Nathalie Dufour, Superintendence director of works and RUP, surveyor Salvatore Martino, Superintendence, collaborator of the RUP Koiné restoration company as operational director of the restoration, engineer Daniele Monaya, coordinator of safety in the execution phase.

We will arrive in 2025, I imagine, and we will see what we can achieve. On aspect 3, however, I tried to document myself a bit more, as you will have seen, I did, I asked for access to the documents also because there was something that was out of place, in the sense that the company Koinè of Rome was commissioned to carry out the preparatory investigation and intervention activities and these activities will become an integral part of the intervention project. Then this project was entrusted with a detailed list of operations, always prepared by Koinè, surveys, mappings, even the technical specifications and the metric calculation. The question is simple: if we have all these skills and you rightly in response to the question of the Hospital, when I asked you why the medieval church was destroyed, you rightly exalted, as is right, the skills of our technicians and of the Superintendency I wonder why all these studies and research must be entrusted to Koinè, which I imagine does not know much about Roman monuments, in fact, from what I asked, I had answers from the staff who are now retired and the facade of the Roman Theater and the Porta Pretoria were entirely followed by the structures of the regional Superintendency and it is not clear why the Arch of Augustus instead must be entrusted to a company in Rome, when we have all the skills here, all the knowledge on the type of pudding, on the mortars, I had them explain to me about particular mortars, even the sands, etc.; material that here in Aosta is known and known well. It also seems to me that there is little bibliography and at an operational level there is not all this expertise to operate on a monument that is unique in the world. They also explained to me that there is a laboratory restoration office for the management of archaeological materials that should have followed the entire technical project; I don't know if it was involved, however, as I told you, I made an access to the documents, we will go even deeper because if we have the skills here, we have the capabilities here, I honestly can't explain why we have to spend public money and assign skills that are not local, when perhaps ours are better prepared."
48002,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Asili nido",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,57,Point no. 15. Councillor Jean-Pierre Guichardaz responds.
48002,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Asili nido",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,FP-PD,2,5813,"How many children in the age groups 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 participate in the project at the Roisan center and how many at the Doues center. With reference to the question, I report the following data: Roisan nursery center seven children, 0-1 none, 1-2 six children, 2-3 one child; Doues nursery center four children, 0-1 two children, 1-2 one child, 2-3 one child. Second question: ""what activity has been carried out to date and what are your initial assessments"". At the Grand-Combin school in Gignod on September 3, 2024, on the occasion of the first teachers' meeting of the nursery school for the 2024-2025 school year, a working group was established which includes the teachers of the nursery schools of the institution called the ""extended group 0-6"". The college established that the working hours of this group will be ten throughout the 2024-2025 school year and that this commitment will be included in the hours provided for by letter a) and letter b) of paragraph 3 of article 44 of the 2019-2021 national employment contract. A restricted group called the ""restricted 0-6 group"" was also formed, which includes only the teachers from the Doues and Roisan campuses directly involved in the hub to deal with specific needs. Two teachers were appointed as referents for the extended 0-6 group, with the task of updating themselves on regional and national legislation and on the 0-6 integrated system, recording the meetings of the extended 0-6 group, collecting observations and requests from colleagues, updating the part of the PTOF relating to continuity with nurseries and the 0-6 integrated system, in collaboration with the school principal, informing the school principal of the critical issues in the application of the 0-6 integrated system. Also during the meeting on September 3, the teachers of the nursery schools of the Grand-Combin institution asked the headmistress to have a meeting with the president of the cooperative La Libellula to get more information on the project ""Grand-Combin nursery school"". The principal accepted the proposal and promptly contacted the President to organize the meeting scheduled for October 16, 2024. The extended group 0-6 has already met in person at the Variney secondary school on October 2, 2024, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., on October 16, 2024 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., on October 30, 2024 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on November 6, 2024. The nursery schools of Etroubles, Gignod, Signayes, Oyace, Valpelline will organize, starting in January 2025, two meetings in which the children of the nursery school will go to the Variney nursery school for a day on the snow and for animated reading. Subsequently, the two-and-a-half-year-old children from the nursery school will visit the kindergarten for a day of creative or musical activities. In addition to these days that are common to all the kindergartens of the entire institution, in this experimental period in the municipalities of Doues and Roisan, the children from the kindergarten and nursery school, given their proximity, will be able to share some of these activities: experience moments of meeting to get to know each other and socialize, take part in some common activities to share the routine, share moments related to the various holidays and events, participate in trips to the local library or for a walk. The activities listed above will be carried out taking into account the educational-didactic program, which has already been established by the teachers of the nursery school at the beginning of the school year, considering the interventions of the experts, the educational trips and the projects of continuity between kindergarten and primary school that have already been decided upon by the teachers' council. The teachers emphasize the importance of maintaining the identity of the nursery school while respecting the reciprocal specificities (nursery/infancy) recalling that there has already been a nursery-infancy continuity for many years between the children of the last year of nursery school, two and a half years old, and the children of the three-year-old nursery school. This bridge project has always been functional. The hours of programming and the number of meetings are not quantified in order to allow a free educational choice for the schools of Douesand Roisan. Since it is an experimental project, ongoing verification will also be planned in order to collect observations and monitor the meetings from time to time in order to conclude the project with a qualitative analysis. The next meetings of the extended group 0-6 are scheduled for March 12 from 2:30-4:30 pm and for March 26 from 2:30-4:30 pm. The latter will be held in the presence of Dr. Christina Arfuso, technical director at the Superintendence of Studies who, with a circular sent to the schools, made herself available to hold information meetings at the request of the schools. The agenda of the two meetings will be defined together with the teachers. On Friday, October 18, the inauguration of the Doues nursery school took place, which was attended by the children of the primary nursery school of the complex together with their teachers; we are waiting for the inauguration date of the Roisan nursery school, where the children of the nursery and primary school of the complex will be invited to participate together with their teachers. The first evaluations highlight a collaboration started in a systematic and shared way. From what can be seen from the pedagogical-didactic point of view, it is necessary to wait a few more months."

48003,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958,M,UV,2,6782,"I am responding to Councilor Lucianaz's requests on 5G antennas, which we have already partly discussed yesterday afternoon. I must say that Law 16/2024, which we recently revised within the scope of Regional Law 25/2005, has as its purpose the unitary management of public stations in the Region. You will remember that the vast majority of the infrastructures were owned by the Unités des Communes or Municipalities and have passed or, rather, are passing through the Region. From this point of view, in accordance with national regulations, a rationalization and optimization of the planning and construction of sites equipped for radio telecommunications of publicly owned stations are envisaged. The changes made, which have been approved by this Council, are intended to adapt the law to the organizational management context, allowing, as I was saying, to formalize the transfer of ownership of radio telecommunications infrastructures of local authorities. On the one hand there is a question of rationalization, as I was saying, and, on the other, there is also the fact that in the dialogue that must be had on these types of infrastructures, an administrative structure such as that of the Region certainly has greater strength and also greater authority. The problem of information that has been raised remains, we have inserted paragraph 5bis in the revision of law 25, which says: ""In order to optimize the planning and construction of publicly owned stations on the regional territory, the regional structure competent in telecommunications matters can request information from telecommunications operators or telecommunications infrastructure operators regarding the planning for the construction of new radioelectric station stations on the territory of the Region"". This is something new, because in fact the big players, in the case of the Aosta Valley there are essentially two, who build those infrastructures, that is, those pylons on which various operators are then positioned; today, they did not have any type of dialogue with the Region by law, which therefore had difficulty understanding especially future planning. Now, based on the law that I was talking about that has just been modified, we have sent letters to the various interlocutors to gain greater clarity on the expanding situation. In the meantime, we were talking about the cartography that shows the different types of antennas installed on the territory. These technical data are the responsibility of the individual operators who must compulsorily communicate them to the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM), which is an independent authority that was established in 1997. Among the various competences of AGCOM is the construction and maintenance of the database of Internet access networks existing on the national territory, this is based on article 22 of the Communications Code that dates back to 2024. The database offers the possibility of analyzing the state of development of the Internet access offer at the individual address and of making comparative assessments on the different technologies and speeds. The information and content requested are the exclusive responsibility of the telecommunications operators themselves, who autonomously and independently manage the policies and technical specifications that concern their own radiocommunication networks. Below is the link, I will give it to the Councilor, to the AGCOM portal for publishing the database of access networks, so, as an example, you will find all the data you requested, but as an example I will give you an extraction of a coverage map of the territory of the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta with 5G technology in the 3.4 GHz-3.8 GHz band and you will see from this colored map where the different stations are and, by entering the AGCOM website, you will see the specific areas for each area. The competent regional structure - I have already said in part what follows - has long since started contacts with the radio and telecommunications infrastructure operators to learn about these development plans in execution of this article 5bis of the new rewriting of law 25 and we have formally asked to be able to know the information relating to the programming and construction of the new radio stations on the regional territory, such informationEnglish: actions have not yet arrived. I must say that the attitude of these companies that manage these stations is an attitude very far from respecting local autonomy, I already said it yesterday, this comes from the fact that the current legislation is a legislation very favorable to the extension of 5G not only in the terms that we discussed yesterday more than doubling the amount of radio frequencies allowed today by law, but also from that recent reform of the law by the Italian Parliament, which, in fact, bypasses the municipal authorities, who were the ones who could propose some type of exception with respect to the technical choice of installation in a certain area; this is unfortunately a sad observation compared evidently to a firepower of these telecommunications companies in the name obviously in this case in particular of the fact that the plan regarding the extension of 5G is strictly linked to the need to spend the funds of the PNRR and therefore the government choice was to speed up as much as possible to avoid any type of interference, even positive of course, by local authorities. Local authorities, I answer the last question, are directly involved in the authorization process provided for by the current law, it goes through the procedures referred to in the one-stop shop. The regional structures will in any case take charge of communicating to local authorities the programming information that will come from the feedback from radiotelecommunication operators or operators involved in the construction of the new stations. I must say frankly that, when we inserted this provision of information from the pylon managers into the reform of law 25, we had doubts that the Government could in some way object to the legitimacy of this law, brandishing, as has sometimes happened in the past, the principle of a division of powers, therefore of a hypothetical unconstitutionality of a request by us to affect structures of this kind. Fortunately, the law has not been challenged and therefore we will do everything possible to be able to have great clarity on future projects for the construction of 5G networks."
48003,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,32,Councilor Lucianaz replies.
48003,XVI,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963,M,RV,4,2892,"Councilor, today I have to thank you for the tone and the completeness of your answer and perhaps, after having clashed, I have to sincerely thank you, also because your answer is complete and satisfactory. There are some critical issues, they are not hidden: one is our poor autonomy... because here it is already a success, from what you said, that with article 5bis the Region can request information from these monsters of communication, therefore, if we are reduced to this, clearly we are not on the side of sovereignty over our territory for sure. As for AGCOM, you rightly told me that it is an independent body, but it must report to Parliament, that is, there is still a Parliament that must verify what it is doing on the territory. I remind you that only recently - yesterday we talked about the Tuscany Region which about two months ago adopted this decision to deepen the research - the AGCOM commissioner Giacomelli wrote at a certain point to the President of Tuscany: ""What is certain is that I will never resign myself to the idea that Tuscany becomes the promised land of flat-earthers, No Vax conspiracy theorists of various kinds"". This is the air that blows in AGCOM, however, apart from this, I had asked for these insights because the whole 5G story started badly and is not working any better. I remind you that on May 5, 2019, AGCOM approved the use of frequencies for 5G without authorization from any Ethics Committee, without informed consent, without prior risk assessment, or environmental and health monitoring. Three days later, May 8, 2019, AGCOM deliberated to begin testing the three 5G bands for two years in 120 Italian municipalities without the knowledge of the citizens but without the knowledge of the Mayors themselves and it continues like this. The latest provision is worrying in my opinion, then I have no other information, the provision of the law you cited, the one of December 31, 2023, as far as I know, was not subjected to any evaluation by the Unified Conference of Local Authorities and there were quite a few Mayors who were worried about this extension. The whole 5G issue, beyond the fact that one can be in favor or not of a pushed technology, is worrying about the ways in which it is implemented. As for the aspect of installing 5G antennas, it is a concern of many people, yesterday I told you in the classroom that only yesterday in Milan they decided to place a thousand antennas on a thousand street lamps in the city precisely because there is this need to have an antenna at least every 100-150 meters, I do not know in Valle d'Aosta what choices will be made, but yesterday's request, in order not to always return to the same topic, was precisely to ask for more information and more comparison. Let's hope that the register will change a bit soon. Thanks anyway."

With regard to the 2024 campaign, I would like to remind you that reference is being made to two separate programming periods: that of the PSR 2014-2022 and that of the CSR 2023-2027 and that for both, starting from 16 October this year, Member States can pay advances of up to 75% for direct payments and up to 85% for rural development interventions based on surface area and animals. It should also be noted that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry has delegated to AGEA the activation of the necessary procedures useful for allowing the payment of advances by the paying agencies. With regard to direct payments, AGEA Coordinamento, with its own circular, has defined the premiums affected by this advance, as well as the maximum percentage of advance that can be paid and the unit amount of the same. The interventions that most concern farmers in the Aosta Valley are the basic payment, redistributive support, payment for young farmers and eco-scheme 1. With regard to rural development interventions, on 4 October 2024 a plenary meeting of AGEA Regions was held to plan the activities necessary for the payment of applications for the 2024 campaign. Coming to the first question, the competent offices tell me that, with regard to direct payments, AGEA has made 1,178 payments, for a total of 2,222,430.25 euros, while, with regard to rural development interventions, no company has yet obtained advance payments. Remaining within the scope of rural development 2023-2027, the Aosta Valley Region has requested AGEA to disburse advances for SRA 30, Animal Welfare, and SRB 01, Compensatory Allowances, rapid annual payments, which play a priority role. At the request of the Region, AGEA has therefore prepared the creation of the automated payment list of the advance relating to the SRA 30 intervention, which concerns 598 beneficiaries and a disbursable amount of €1,166,171.37. Regarding the second and third questions, I would like to point out that the advances are normally paid by AGEA by 30 November each year. For example, the advances for the 2023 campaign of the SRA 30 intervention were issued on 28 November 2023. With regard to the agri-environmental measures of the PSR 2014-2022, measure 10, and the annual payments for animal welfare, the SRA 30 and the compensatory allowance for mountain areas, the SRB 01 of the CSR, we currently do not see any technical problems that would prevent the advances from being paid by 30 November. I can therefore state that, given the usual timing of the advance payments, we cannot speak today of a real delay in the liquidation of these measures. As regards the SRA 08 interventions, the agri-environment, the SRA 29, organic farming, of the CSR 2023-2027, activated for the first time in Valle d'Aosta this year in the 2024 campaign, they were the subject of the last technical meeting between AGEA and the Regions, which took place on Friday 15 November, during which it emerged that the implementation of the new algorithms could require a longer timeframe than an ordinary year. The definitive regional provision by AREA VDA of the data necessary for the disbursement of these advances took place on the following Monday, that of 18 November 2024. AGEA reassured the Regions that the SRA 29 intervention, therefore organic farming, of particular interest to our Region, will be given priority for development."

48004,XVI,AGRICOLTURA,en,Planaz,Dino,1972,M,RV,4,1652,"Thank you Councilor for your reply. I would like to point out that the title of the initiative is not my own free will, it came out of the offices, but it is understandable. We know very well that the advance payment from European directives cannot be paid before October 16, it goes until November 30 and then we need to see if the practices of the companies coincide with the commitments requested, but following your entire list of aid - and I thank you for the clarity of your answer - I have a doubt, but we will evaluate later with other documents, but you said that the Aosta Valley farmers are entitled to eco-scheme 1 and you did not tell me about eco-scheme 2. Eco-scheme 2, just to clarify, is the eco-scheme that is most representative in our Region, it is the eco-scheme linked to the grazing of animals, an eco-scheme of significant importance both from an economic point of view but also from the point of view of animal welfare that I do not see mentioned in your answer, if then perhaps you can send it to me in a different way or we will proceed with another type of initiative. We are pleased that the aid continues, taking into account the new programming that began for a number of measures last year, but it takes time to get into full swing. We hope that the advances will be paid in the expected time and that they can provide some support to companies in a period like this at the end of the season where the (incomprehensible) has ended where a whole series of economic commitments by the same are followed and to be able to also deal with the organization of everything that concerns the winter season and the following ones."
48005,XVI,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,61,"Point no. 18. For the answer, the floor is given to Councillor Carrel."
48005,XVI,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Carrel,Marco,1992,M,PA,2,2764,"On 29 October 2024, the Legambiente Valle d'Aosta Association sent a note to the Councillor for Agriculture and Natural Resources and, for information, to the media, in which it reported excessive hunting related to the culling of foxes in the regional territory during the 2024-2025 hunting season. The issue emerged during the meeting of the Regional Wildlife Council on 31 May 2024, where the new hunting calendar for the 2024-2025 season was illustrated. At that meeting, the representative of the local authorities expressed concern about the increase in the number of foxes that are increasingly approaching residential areas, creating numerous inconveniences and risking spreading diseases. In this regard, I would like to point out that between 2023 and 2024, the competent bodies confirmed 56 cases of distemper on foxes and mustelids in our region. Although not dangerous for humans, distemper is a disease that directly affects wild and domestic carnivores, especially young dogs. It manifests itself with problems in the nervous system, which risk causing possible paralysis, or with respiratory complications. It spreads through direct contact, through urinary and fecal excretions or through contaminated food. Foxes are also a target species for rabies health surveillance. I would like to reiterate that in our Region there is no limit on the killing of this species and that the hunting calendar does not include any merit rating in this regard. However, the Regional Committee for Hunting Management has the power to assign merit ratings for the killing of this animal through internal regulations. The proposal to encourage measures to reduce the fox population was therefore accepted at the Committee meeting with resolution no. 22/2024 of 8 August 2024, which, in its autonomy, decided to assign a merit score of 0.5 points for each fox killed and delivered to one of the control centers present in the regional territory. This document also specifies that the fox must be regularly registered and housed. The interest on my part and that of the competent offices regarding this issue is concrete and constant, as already reiterated in my response of 4 November to Legambiente. In light of the critical issues related to the disposal of the carcasses that were reported to me, as well as those reported to the offices of the Department of Natural Resources, I personally reported to the Committee, which issued an information note on 18 October on the correct management of killed game animals."
48005,XVI,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,47,"For the reply, the floor is given to Councilor Ganis."
48005,XVI,CACCIA E PESCA,en,Ganis,Christian,1973,M,FI,4,1183,"Thank you Mr President and I thank the Councilor for the answer and for clarifying what happened. I was inspired to present this question by the fact that Legambiente sent a letter to the Councilor highlighting an excess of hunting for the fox species. Starting from the assumption that fox hunting is foreseen, as the Councilor has rightly pointed out, in the 2024-2025 hunting calendar in stray or harnessed mode, what surprises me is Legambiente's report. Personally, I have been hunting for eight years and I have never come across carcasses of foxes killed and abandoned in our woods. Among other things, I would like to point out, as the Councilor has also rightly pointed out, that foxes are wild animals and as such must remain even away from urban centers and much less are they animals that can be dangerous and harmful. For this reason, an increase in slaughtered animals can be linked to a possible spread of some disease, such as rabies or distemper, or simply to correct hunting management. At this point, we take note of your response, which we share."
48006,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,40,Point 19. Councillor Bertschy responds.
48006,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,UV,2,3314,"The question proposes four questions regarding the snow park in Gressoney-Saint-Jean, the first asks whether the authorizations that were missing in March 2024 have now been acquired in full and that they are precisely interventions for programmed snowmaking, referring to an answer given in the chamber precisely in February 2024 and March 2024. The authorization process with respect to a whole series of authorizations has moved forward, what is not concluded is the issue of the registration of the slopes and the acquisition of the areas and however the procedure for the expansion works has been regularly entrusted, the interventions however have not yet been able to begin. ""If it is true that at least one owner has not made his land available for the purposes of the snowpark"": yes, it is true that one owner has not made the Monterosa area available pursuant to law 9/1992, authorizing, however, only for the 2024-2025 season, the management of the area in the configuration prior to the start of the new authorization process. ""If the aforementioned moving carpet will actually be brought to Staffal"", it was mentioned in the introduction: ""Taking note that the long moving carpet would be brought to Staffal..."", yes, also because for the second season it would otherwise have been unused, this does not create problems for the future because there will be a regular application for funding under law 8/2004 for the purchase of an additional carpet that will be allocated to the Gressoney-Saint-Jean snowpark once the authorization process and the procedure for the implementation of investments have clearly been completed, so also to avoid maintaining an unused infrastructure this choice was made, but this does not affect future investment work. Point 4: ""whether the Weissmatten snowpark will open regularly for the winter season and if so whether in full with all the conveyor belts or only partially"". The snowpark will open in its previous configuration and prior to the start of the new authorization process, therefore with the service proposal that has been used up to now, therefore there are no stops to the service and at the moment the proposed investment is not feasible in accordance with the problem that has emerged, but which is obviously being evaluated by the owners. In the past few days, the questioner, Councilor Minelli, and I received a note from the owner, who I do not know, I learned about it first informally also from the colleague who does not know her either, who wanted to give her version of the facts regarding the current situation. I spoke to her personally, I asked her if I could also send this note to the company to have its own version also in response to the things that have been anticipated. In the next few hours I will send both communications to the Group Leaders so that they have full knowledge of the things that are being exposed and of the situation that is in place at this time regarding the use of the area. What I believe is important is to clarify that the snowpark will open in the previous configuration, all the infrastructures will be used as proposed up to now and the process will be completed during the year to then make the investment for the 2025-2026 season."
48006,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,59,Councilor Minelli has asked to speak and may do so.
48006,XVI,"SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO, Sport invernali",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,4,4531,"Thank you for your reply. The Councillor said that, in replying to his colleague Lavy last February and then to me in March, he had gone into the merits of the snowpark issue, that our initiatives were more generally in the Weissmatten area, but we had also addressed that issue and it had been explained to us that the conveyor belt was not in operation at that time, both because - this was what the Councillor had said - there was rightly not enough snow (we had also discussed what could be brought as snow and I had been told that many trucks had to pass, in reality with a snowcat you could move the snow...), and then because - it had been rightly said - not all the authorisations were available and among these authorisations the procedure for obtaining the availability of the areas had been mentioned. We also know that the conveyor belt had been dismantled to start the artificial snowmaking work, which however at the moment is not there and is not concluded. Then we learned of a further critical issue from the territory, which was precisely the lack of willingness on the part of all the owners to allow Monterosa to install that carpet, so we presented the question to know the state of the art. I had also checked the situation, before filing, because the work on laying the carpet, the usual, traditional one, had not even started, then instead in the days immediately before the Council I verified that something had started. Now on the issue of the authorizations the Councilor says that the process has moved forward, but it is not concluded, because he confirms to me that there is a problem related to this owner. He also said a little while ago that we both received this letter; I also do not know the Lady, I have not called her, but I have read what she wrote to us and I am happy that the Councilor in some way accepts the will of the Lady who asked to read the letter in the Council, it will not be read but will reach the Group Leaders, but in essence - and this seems correct to say - what is it said? It is said that there has always been a willingness to give the land, both that of the snow park and others that this Lady in Trinité owns, to the Monterosa company to carry out its activities, but in compliance with the contracts, contracts that have been declared valid, even recently by a ruling of the Court of Appeal of Turin, which condemned the company to pay a arrears until 2018 or 2020, I don't remember, then the situations of the following years will remain to be verified. However, there is a willingness, and this is highlighted in the letter, also to discuss these contracts, there is no unilateral position: either everything is kept standing or it is done like this, or we do not give any authorization. And what strikes me is that there is not, on the other side, an equal willingness to discuss and negotiate, because, from what we understand - and then you will see - in response to a still recent letter or a communication, I don't know, I don't remember the formula exactly, that the owner gave for the availability of the land, in compliance with the contracts, the response was a letter stating that the contracts are being rescinded! Now I am not an expert, I don't know if it is possible to unilaterally rescind a contract, I don't know, but it seems to me that, from the point of view of the attitude, there is something that is not right. Then there was also the announcement that an appeal will be made to the Supreme Court, but the Councilor had already anticipated this in one of my responses some time ago, precisely when I spoke about that ruling in his response in the chamber. What does this mean? It means a waste of money for everyone, it means time, it means a dispute that could go on again for a long time. It would seem to me much more useful for everyone, for the community then, at the end of the day, that we sit around a table and discuss in a calm manner. This does not happen. The Lady asks, among other things, to be treated with education and I have no doubt that this request has some foundation, because we know well, we have seen many times how things work... so you will have the opportunity to read and make your own assessments. My invitation however - and I do it through the Councilor obviously, because he is the Councilor of reference - is that with the company there is the possibility of arriving at different attitudes, because thisIt doesn't take us anywhere."
48007,XVI,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,UV,1,4282,"The question asks two questions, the first: ""whether the Consulta for cycling mobility has been formally established and has begun its activity""; the second: ""whether it can be convened in good time to provide useful information for the purposes of participating in the notice relating to the aforementioned call for tenders"", reference is made to a call for tenders from the Municipality of Aosta. As regards the first question, the Consulta is in the process of being established, we have sent letters to the Departments, to the bodies, we are also looking - we talked about it just the other day together with a member of an association that represents cycling mobility - the methods for assigning the composition of the Consulta to the reference associations, so this is a work that is in progress, because, as we know, there are members to be appointed who represent the Departments, the CPEL, but also the reference associations, so we have also consulted CONI on the matter, so there is a work in progress. We are establishing the Consulta and we are also completing the establishment of the office that will deal with sustainable mobility. An official has been hired, obviously through a competition, and the further assignment of an accounting assistant has also been carried out, which will finally allow us to have - if you will probably remember it even from the time of your period as Councilor - a structure that can govern future planning, both for everything that cycling mobility will have to represent, also for the regional transport plan, and the coordination actions with the various Departments. I remember that the Tourism Department proposes cycling mobility to make it grow as an attraction and as a possibility, on which to give opportunities for fun in the free time of both the people of the Aosta Valley and those who will be our guests and the Department of Councilor Sapinet is responsible for the implementation of the investments. Therefore, the task of the structure that has been built and that will become increasingly operational in the coming months is an important task, also of coordination with all the subjects that can help us to grow cycling mobility, especially soft mobility in the Aosta Valley. As for point 2: ""whether it can be convened in good time to provide useful information for the purposes of participation in the notice relating to the aforementioned project"", it will depend a little on the response times now; surely the Consulta will begin its activity between the end of the year and the first days of the new year, because I imagine that this could be the objective for everyone. With respect to the notice, we had the opportunity to speak with Councilor Sartore in the municipality of Aosta to also coordinate on the objectives that the Municipality intends to achieve with this proposal and also to ensure that a useful working table with all the subjects is activated in any case, taking into account that there will be this important notice, but above all that these activities will continue and the role of the Consulta will be important precisely to have the opinion of all the subjects around the table to develop projects in line with the objectives that we intend to achieve. The guidelines for cycling mobility are contained in the general plan for urban and extra-urban cycling mobility of the Ministry of Infrastructure and were drawn up in Valle d'Aosta in 2019 in the first draft of the regional plan, even if it was then postponed due to the issue relating to Covid and we are now resuming the activity that will lead us to have, within the proposal of the regional transport plan, also a renewed edition of the plan for regional cycling mobility. There are therefore numerous activities underway, also an important connection with both the Municipality of Aosta and with the local authorities and full operation will take place in the coming months. I must say that, hearing a little from all the parties interested in the objective, there is pleasure and interest in starting this work, which will be an important work to develop together, also to connect the many projects and investments that are in the area and the promotions that even the local authorities have started to make on the projects completed."
48007,XVI,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Bertschy,Luigi Giovanni,1965,M,Presidente,2,31,Councilor Minelli replies.
48007,XVI,"CONSULTE COMMISSIONI E ORGANI COLLEGIALI, SPORT E TEMPO LIBERO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966,F,PCP,3,4330,"As the Councilor also recalled, we established, with the law that modified 16/2019, the Consultation for cycling mobility with the obvious aim of supporting policies and interventions in the field of sustainable mobility with a lower environmental impact. This question stemmed from the fact that we wanted to have an account of what had been sent forward so far, in particular to know if the Consulta had been officially established, we had also asked in relation to this notice that the Councilor cited, which is not a call for tenders from the Municipality of Aosta, but from the Ministry for Sport, a notice called ""Bici in comune"" and provides for projects for the implementation of cycling mobility in the various municipalities, initiatives related to cycle tourism, but also projects for schools, redevelopment projects and so on and the applications must be submitted between 7 November and 13 January 2025. One of the needs that exists to submit the projects is also to have some somewhat common guidelines for what concerns signage and other aspects, with a view to then having a cycling mobility platform in the future. The Councilor tells us that the Consulta is in the process of being established, so it is not yet formally established, and also hearing what he told us, that is, that it will become fully operational between the end of this year and the beginning of 2025, for the purpose for which I had asked for clarifications, that is, to give some indications also for this call, there cannot be a contribution from him. Beyond this, the will was also a bit to urge the continuation of the work, therefore really the establishment of this Consulta. You said, Councilor, that you have heard the reference associations because they must nominate their representative in the Consulta and also CONI, I imagine that among the reference associations there is Fiab à Vélo, because it is then the most representative, if not perhaps at this moment the only one we have in the territory. This is certainly very important, but what I would like to underline is that, when we talk about cycling mobility, we are talking about something more complex than a sport, a sporting activity, recreational, free time, that is, we are talking about a different way of moving, of moving people, objects, goods in some cases, therefore it goes in the perspective of a connection to the transport network through the use of the bicycle, therefore a Consulta that deals with cycling mobility, even if only for consultative purposes, because then this is what this body will do, it must take this into account and therefore not focus only or mainly on the sporting aspect. Well, the thing you told us, namely the implementation of staff in the Office for Sustainable Mobility, which is important, because we know that without resources it is difficult to follow the various issues. I would like to say one thing though: within this Council, where we know that people must also be nominated by the three relevant Departments, therefore your Department, the Department of Councilor Sapinet and the Department of Grosjacques, there would, in our opinion, also be an interest in having people like - I'm not saying that it has to be this - mobility managers, that is, people who have an idea of ​​what sustainable mobility should be beyond the aspects mainly related to tourism, because, in our opinion, even everything that concerns the ""Bike to school"" or ""Bike to work"" part, which is what is going forward in many places, would find its reason to exist in our region. The Council will therefore be established, I believe that it will really also have to have in its composition an attention to these aspects, for which obviously we urge attention. One last joke, two seconds, I'm so sorry that that project, that part of sustainable mobility, which was already in the 2019 transport plan, was then put aside because of Covid. I say this as a joke: this morning I received a cartoon from a friend that said: ""And then you realize that 2025 is in a month and a half and Covid was 5 years ago and 2050 is as close as 2000!"", so you have to be careful because time passes very quickly."

First of all, I thank my colleague for the attention he has paid and has paid to this issue, also for the constructive discussions held on the sidelines of the work of the Chamber. The interventions that the Regional Administration has promoted for the extraordinary maintenance and safety of the regional road network also include these works to improve the safety and redevelopment of regional road no. 8, from kilometre 2,100 to kilometre 2,600, the second lot in the municipality of Antey-Saint-André, with a total amount of €585,000. The intervention consists of the reconstruction of a section of degraded masonry supporting regional road no. 8, included precisely between the aforementioned progressives, for an extension of 500 meters, in addition to the positioning of a new road barrier and the maintenance of the road surface. The works allow to complete the improvement of the safety of the aforementioned section, already begun with the previous functional lot, which involved the widening of the carriageway through the construction of a reinforced concrete structure for a total amount at the time of €1,125,000. As part of the planned works of the second functional lot, the construction of the retaining wall foreseen in the project and the related kerbs has been completed at the moment. Special New Jersey barriers have also been positioned to protect the lateral edge of the road. Currently on the section of the regional road in question the alternating one-way system has been removed, therefore a two-way traffic system has been restored, without limitations. Finally, we inform you that the installation of the road barriers and the asphalting of the section of road will be planned for next spring, also considering the climatic conditions of the period which are not compatible with such works. I would also like to add that in the next few weeks we will meet with the Municipal Administration of La Magdeleine, a consolidation intervention is planned for the bridge that leads to the capital and the town of La Magdeleine following the monitoring carried out in the years 2021-2022, the creation of an alternative road, so as to then be able to intervene on the bridge, an intervention that was rescheduled following the flood event."

As you have already expressed in your response to my question, beyond the fact that I frequently travel that stretch of road, I had received many reports of the fact that more than anything else there was this one-way alternating that creates difficulties for traffic. We certainly understand all the difficulties of the companies that have to complete the work and perhaps within the expected timeframes or perhaps the inconveniences that there are, also due to the flood of last June 30, which created further changes of destination, of contracts of the companies that had to concentrate their energies to go and give urgent answers, where perhaps there was most need. The circulation has been reopened, even if we understand very well that, as far as the asphalt of the roadway, it will go in the period that is most appropriate, because we know very well that at the moment it is not possible. We thank you for the collaboration that there has been because in this way we have given an answer to places that really needed it."

48009,XVI,"ASSETTO DEL TERRITORIO, Difesa ed uso del suolo - Sistemazione idrogeologica",en,Sapinet,Davide,1976,M,UV,2,3609,"The initiative of our colleague Aggravi allows us to make a quick note of the situation regarding the work done and planned in the municipality of Valtournenche in the Breuil-Cervinia area. Our colleague questions the regional government to find out what the state of the art is regarding the interventions related to the safety of the area affected by the calamitous event this summer, as well as regarding the installation of the bridges of the walkways functional to the connection of the two banks, as well as access to the slopes and numerous tourist facilities in the area. Following the flood event of 29 and 30 June 2024, the Hydraulic Works structure carried out the activities of clearing the 500 meters of the Cervino torrent that cross the town of Breuil, personnel of the Hydraulic Works structures, whom I thank because, when a part of them was operating in Cogne, the other part of the structure monitored the situation in Breuil-Cervinia with even some employees who returned from vacation in a very short time, therefore something also worthy of mention. Subsequently, parapets were positioned in place along the bank of the watercourse and concrete New Jersey barriers to increase the safety margin compared to the previously existing conditions. A reinforced concrete wall was then rebuilt on the orographic left to protect the watercourse upstream of via Carrel. These interventions are currently concluded. In parallel with these works, a punctual monitoring system was installed on the watercourse that is able to identify the passage of a debris flow in the basin upstream of the town. The monitoring system, once installed, was handed over to the Municipal Administration for its operational management in terms of Civil Protection, a system similar to the one positioned the previous year following the events of Bionaz and Oyace. A task was then assigned to study and design works in two separate sections of the Cervino torrent, which concern in particular two debris flow containment basins that follow one another immediately downstream of runway no. 5 and upstream of the town and then the reconstruction of the Cervino torrent banks along via Bich up to the confluence with the Marmore torrent, modifying the slopes of the riverbed and transforming the via Carrel bridge, which is currently a vehicular bridge, into a pedestrian bridge to allow for the disposal of flow rates comparable to those that occurred during the event at the end of June 2024. The detailed aspects in the urbanized section will obviously be the subject of discussion and consultation with the municipal administration. The designers in charge are completing the technical-economic feasibility project for the intervention as a whole with the aim of obtaining the opinion of the Po River District Authority. This opinion is binding for the financing of the works through state funds from the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security, which amount to around €8,100,000. The executive projects for the works will then be drawn up, works that are intended to be started at the beginning of next spring. As for the walkways, the Municipality of Valtournenche has provided for the installation, exclusively - this must be specified - for the winter season, three crossings to connect the center with the ski slope area and with the tourist facilities."

48009,XVI,"ASSETTO DEL TERRITORIO, Difesa ed uso del suolo - Sistemazione idrogeologica",en,Aggravi,Stefano,1985,M,RV,4,1999,"I'll start from the bottom, actually the passage that you made only for the winter season... we hope that the three walkways can return to 5, or in any case that there can be the same possibility of passage that there was previously. I don't know what the situation is today, but unfortunately, walkways were placed, when the snow arrived, the walkways cannot be crossed because the shoulder of the walkways has not been completed, so the walkways essentially, from the information I have, are not usable because the snow has arrived, so we hope that as soon as possible the shoulders of the bridges and walkways can be completed in such a way as to make the passage usable, because otherwise the work would be useless. There is also an issue related not only to reaching the bottom of the slope, the start of the slope or the start of the Cervino facilities, but also a safety issue, because the premises are in any case beyond the bridge and, in the event that there is a need to pass an ambulance or something else, there is a need not for a walkway but for a bridge as there was previously. Having said that, we, as we had already announced during the discussion of the Economic and Financial Document with the agenda, will continue to monitor the situation and we reserve the right to take further initiatives precisely because, I repeat, there is a desire to keep an eye on an area that has been worked on, that will need to be worked on, because, as you yourself said, it is not that everything is over, there are steps to be taken forward. We hope that it can be redeveloped and made safe, as has been invested in and as will be invested upstream to avoid a repetition of the situation. It is an area, among other things, that in season is heavily urbanized and therefore requires greater safety. In the short term, what we hope for is that the walkways can be made available to citizens and tourism operators as soon as possible."

48010,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Alcolismo e tossicodipendenze, Politiche giovanili",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,98,Let's get back to work. We are at item no. 23 of the agenda. Councilor Marzi answers.
48010,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Alcolismo e tossicodipendenze, Politiche giovanili",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,7516,"Coming to the first question, that is ""knowing what actions are implemented to combat youth distress"", more specifically the intake of substances that alter the perception of reality, the so-called ""youth distress"" is a concept that, in reality, simplifies a series of emotional, psychological and social difficulties that young people can experience, including individual, family, school, social and cultural factors. The complexity of the phenomenon can translate into different situations that range from substance abuse to full-blown psychiatric disorder, to marginalization, to school dropout and lack of prospects; therefore it is clear that the appropriate response cannot consequently be either unique or the exclusive responsibility of healthcare. However, coming to the healthcare world, the service for pathological addictions, therefore the SERD of the USL Company, currently provides a multidisciplinary team dedicated to minors, that is, young people and adults up to 26 years of age, which is composed of a psychiatrist, a nurse, three psychologists psychotherapists, a social worker and a professional educator. The care of patients who turn to the SERD involves an initial phase of multidisciplinary reception and diagnosis that includes several interviews with specialists. This is followed by the return of the individualized therapeutic plan in which a diagnosis, the objectives to be pursued, the expected results, the methods of implementing the various interventions to be prepared, the times of implementation, the times of verification and evaluation of the processes and outcomes are defined. These are also identified, with respect to the operators in charge of the case on the basis of the therapeutic program outlined. It is therefore important to specify that the abuse or dependence on narcotic substances, rather than drugs, alcohol or screen in minors and/or young adults, almost always represents a secondary and associated phenomenon that originates from a problematic psychic functioning in evolutionary development. From a more strictly psychopathological point of view, in addition to dependence, various disorders can be highlighted, of personality, of learning from attention deficit and hyperactivity, of conduct rather than of the psychotic spectrum. According to the prevalent pathology or the relevance of the problems, the SERD, therefore the addiction service, directs to the competent service according to the memorandum of understanding or agreements between services, therefore either to child neuropsychiatry or to psychiatry, in cases over 18 years of age, and/or to the psychosocial services of the minors area. The types of services provided by the SERD are psychiatric medical visits, psychological interviews and psychotherapy, educational and social interviews, nursing care, the intensive outpatient alcohol detox program, psycho-educational groups for both minors and young people and their families, the smoking cessation clinic, the clinic for the innovative transcranial magnetic stimulation. The latter, which we approved, among other things, in September 2024, is for our Region - the first in Italy - free for resident patients affected by pathological addictions and psychiatric and neurological disorders, therefore included in the additional regional LEA. Other Regions are studying and copying it, but applying dramatic costs, naturally outside of any additional LEA coverage. As regards prevention, we recall that it represents the SERD through a specific work team and is responsible for organically and stably starting a series of initiatives whose purposes are: intercepting young people before they begin to show discomfort through the use of substances, therefore primary prevention, or with compulsive behaviors and/or before they become dependent on them, therefore secondary prevention; reducing social and health costs related to the use/consumption of old and new generation substances; constantly monitoring the phenomenon of substance use in our region. The health promotion projects in progress are the following: the SERD prevention initiative program for the 2024-2025 school year, which includes interventions in schools on substance addictions and compulsive behaviors; the listening desks; the Legality Week in collaboration with the Tapermanent technical flight legality and intergenerationality. Also of strategic importance is the Youngle VDA project, financed with state funds GAP, on pathological gambling, recently launched through an application to be installed on the mobile phone that offers a virtual space where adolescents can chat by representing their problems anonymously among themselves, therefore without hierarchies and therefore among peers. This is the most innovative and functional aspect: young people talk to other young people who are specially trained and constantly supported by a psychologist and a specialized educator who therefore provide support and guarantee timely and professional responses to the needs of the children involved. There are also numerous collaborations with the school world of the Department of colleague Guichardaz through the Permanent Technical Table for Legality and Intergenerationality, of the schools that adhere to the prevention initiatives promoted by the SERD and for each school year and in the schools where the SERD desk is active, of the class councils, offering advice and discussion for the students who are in the care of the SERD itself. Networking is therefore also guaranteed thanks to the various technical tables and working groups that have been established over time, therefore the Permanent Technical Table on Intergenerational Legality already mentioned, the Working Group on Bullying, the Interinstitutional Table for the Prevention of Suicide, the Working Group on Mental Distress in Adolescents. With respect to the fight against bullying, with Resolution 681 of last June 2024, together with the offices of the Departments of colleagues Guichardaz and Grosjacques, we have started the process of analysis and planning of a project aimed at experimenting the anti-bullying certification model in our region. The projects that are being carried out are precisely aimed at rationalizing the current dense network of collaboration between different bodies and sectors, health, school, training, work, justice, to ensure as early and effective care as possible. We are therefore convinced that it is increasingly important to speak openly about forms of distress, as we are doing, for example, together with the association Il Mandorlo fiorito in the area of ​​suicide prevention, both to break down stigma, fears and prejudices, and to bring people closer together by increasing the sense of community. We must deploy every useful tool to support our young people who need to develop greater resistance to the negative influence of some social models of our times. The goal is therefore to help them increase self-awareness, promoting self-protection and psychophysical well-being. Last but not least this Monday in the resolution on needs and in the allocation of resources for all services for minors we have naturally increased both needs and allocations."

48010,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SOCIALE, Alcolismo e tossicodipendenze, Politiche giovanili",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,4,1813,"Thank you Councilor for your detailed response, which I will obviously review and analyze in more detail when I deliver the report, but it seems to me that a very interesting analysis has been made, certainly well-focused. The complaint that had been made by the Director of the SERD who had reported alarming numbers had raised a series of questions and concerns in those who had read these data. I recall them only for the benefit of the Chamber, numbers that tell us that there were 166 young patients in the first half of 2024, therefore 166 young people in six months, 49 in the age group up to 19 years, 117 between 19 and 25 years. Unfortunately, the Director of the SERD defined it like this: ""the most drugged era in human history"", it is certainly a danger, a serious danger that unfortunately the young generations are running and, as has been said - and, in my opinion, it is absolutely important - we must not only treat and take care of intercepting this type of criticality, therefore of dependence and bring people rightly from a condition of dependence to a condition of freedom, therefore of independence, but we must go upstream, therefore try to intercept what are the factors that lead to this type of dependence and understand and imagine that there are 166 young people who unfortunately fall into the spiral, this only as regards addictions, it must make us reflect on the dangers of modern society, which in many parts defines itself as open, defines itself as more inclusive, more tolerant, freer and so on, but then in reality we look at the data and we realize that there is an often underground malaise, which certainly should not be ignored. I thank you for your response and obviously we will analyze in more detail what you answered us."
48011,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,40,Point no. 24. Councillor Marzi responds.
48011,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,5302,"Let's start by answering the questions: 1) what is the current status of the works concerning the construction of the G3 building for the expansion of the technological plants; 2) what complications are causing the accumulated delay that has reached almost a year since the announced start of the works for the construction of the G3 building. It is important to first highlight that, while the work in this room in the previous sessions was partly concentrated on providing correct answers to the concerns regarding the hospital bicycle parking or the temporary inconvenience caused in Via Guido Rey for the works for the construction of the Community House, an inspection was carried out in the construction area between the USL Company and SIV to close the overall delivery process of the construction areas which then materialized from the USL to SIV on November 13th. The theme of the Hospital, and therefore also of the financing of the G3 body of technological centers, was at the center, as also recalled at the last Council, of an important and fruitful meeting in which I participated with the managers of the Department at the Ministry of Health last November 12. On that occasion we learned favorably, from the Ministry, that our Region is among the best in Italy for the spending capacity of state financing granted as an investment account, therefore for the object of the financing of this initiative. More precisely, the Aosta Valley has completed over 80% of the financing lines for approximately 68 million and for the remaining 20 million, for approximately 17 million, it is in the process of being implemented. English: The works for the construction of the G3 building were started last spring and in particular involved the construction of the new gas line, the placement of a new reduction cabin near via Chaligne to serve the Hospital, the construction of some plant works inside the existing premises used as technological power plants, aimed at being able to reconnect the new gas reduction group, the construction of an embankment, therefore an accumulation of earth created artificially and functional to the maintenance of escape routes and safety of the hospital facility, the coordination with the activities of other companies operating simultaneously for works in progress in the hospital facility. As we have already reported in response to questions on the same subject, the works for the construction of the technological power plants required first of all to proceed with some interventions on the technological networks existing in the area of ​​interest. Some technical changes were therefore made from a design point of view with the aim of maximizing the productivity of the works and recovering the time dedicated to the transfer of the utilities. In light of what has been illustrated, we therefore confirm that the construction work on the G3 building has never suffered administrative interruptions since it began last spring. Coming to question no. 3 ""what consequences on the fundability of part of the interventions, using PNRR resources, can be determined in light of the accumulated delay"", in recalling what has been illustrated, there are currently no forecasts of delays in carrying out the works compared to the overall timetable. As for the sources of funding - and I believe you will be particularly happy about this because it avoids any type of comment on the answer - it is important to inform you that over the past months the intervention in question has been remodulated. As is known, the intervention of the overall expenditure, quantified at 6.5 million euros, included co-financing by the European Union for 2,763,013 euros under the PNRR entitled ""Towards a new safe and sustainable hospital. PNC mission 6 health"". Subsequently, Legislative Decree 19/2024 provided that investments intended for the implementation of the program called ""Towards a Safe and Sustainable Hospital"" - already financed by the PNC, a fund therefore complementary to the PNRR -, with the exception of those of the autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano and the Campania Region, are all to be charged to the financing referred to in Article 20 of Law 67/1988. In fact, this provision has therefore provided for a different financing path compared to what was initially defined and therefore no longer connected to the PNRR funds, mdirectly at the expense of the State. This issue has also been the subject of extensive discussion and was confirmed at the meeting we held with the representatives of the Ministry of Health on November 12. The competent structure of the Department has therefore already started, in the face of numerous discussions with the ministerial representatives, the remodulation of the financing and the preparation of the documents for the signing of the program agreement with the State that will replace the documents that originally linked the financing to the PNRR and PNC funds. For the third time I reiterate that this, among other things, was one of the topics discussed during the meeting on November 12 and one of the main reasons why the undersigned was present."
48011,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,50,"For the reply, the floor is given to Councilor Lucianaz."
48011,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963,M,RV,4,1467,"Councilor, well, then, thanks to this question, we learn that it will no longer be included in the PNRR plan. I was not aware of it and therefore I do not know well, I will ask you maybe next time, if this will certainly also lead to an extension of the times for the construction. I remember that almost 330 days have passed, therefore over 60% of the time expected for the construction of the work, but so far, as far as I know, not a single blow of the pickaxe has been made in that area, except for the movement of the gas as we saw this past spring. There will be a lot of work in that area, I remember that the external perimeter wall will have to be torn down, the protections, the sidewalks will be occupied, an excavation will be carried out for the medium voltage line, if I understood correctly, which will reach up to the gatehouse I imagine, but here we have not yet had the opportunity to have any prospectus, any drawings. The works are long, we have not understood at all what are the causes of this delay of over a year, you were quick, I will kindly ask you for a copy of your speech, because I was not able to follow you with particular attention, however what was the cause of this delay due, as you say, to a generic intervention on technological networks, it would be good to understand. In any case, I thank you for your reply, I kindly ask you for a copy of the text of your reply and we will keep our eyes wide open on this construction site."
48012,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,68,Item no. 25. Councillor Marzi asked to speak for the answer.
48012,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,1077,"Coming to question no. 1 ""whether similar reports have been received"", to date neither the ASL Company nor the Department have received any reports on the need to extend the current daily parking limit to ASL employees in possession of a monthly pass at the Parini car park. Second question: ""Whether it has been planned to extend the maximum daily parking limit for ASL employees in possession of a monthly pass at the Parini car park"". The 12-hour working hours for staff, initially planned by the ASL Company at an experimental level, are becoming increasingly widespread by virtue of the appreciation shown by operators and the good results of the monitoring indicators. Therefore, given the excellent success of the experiment implemented, the company has communicated that it is available to examine in greater depth the contents of the agreement with the Aosta Public Services Company, the APS, in order to provide for an extension of the current maximum daily parking limit."
48012,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,59,Councilor Manfrin asked to speak for a reply.
48012,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983,M,LEGA VDA,4,1212,"Thank you Councillor. I am very pleased with your response. As we briefly summarised in the question and as you rightly recognised, the 12-hour shift, which was initially little used, is now increasingly used, the 12-hour shift is increasingly used and what happens? It happens that the parking is obviously 12 hours, but exactly 12 hours, therefore, since the parking is 12 hours, if I do a 12-hour shift, I will obviously arrive in the car park earlier, then I will have to get dressed, therefore I will arrive a little earlier, inside the car park I will have to get dressed, after which I will stamp my 12 hours and then I will have to go to the car park, therefore surely in this half hour or an hour more unfortunately it is inevitable that it will be foreseen. It is therefore clear that giving the possibility to those who have a season ticket to extend the 12 hours, therefore making a reasoning that inserts within the season ticket a possibility of a wider parking is certainly something that goes in the direction of favoring the health personnel of our hospital structure. I therefore thank you for your response and I hope that we can have some results in this sense soon."
48013,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,1,40,Point no. 26. Councillor Marzi responds.
48013,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,9731,"Before answering the questions in the question, we believe it is necessary to briefly summarize the path we have followed, which, according to the results obtained, reassures us and allows us to maintain that we are following the best possible path with regard to the subject of this question. In fact, we believe it is first of all important to remember that in the regional territory, in addition to the Umberto Parini hospital, there is only one other hospital structure: the ISAV, more commonly known as the Saint-Pierre clinic. This structure, as an accredited private hospital, has had collaborations with the USL Company focused for several years exclusively on the orthopedic field, also due to its single-professional nature. The agreement between the USL Company and ISAV therefore focused exclusively on the field of orthopedic surgery, both in the outpatient regime and in ordinary hospitalization, and on orthopedic and neurological rehabilitation services. More recently, we have encouraged collaborations also in the field of long-term care, not only orthopedic and day surgery, that is, simple surgical interventions that are resolved in a day or with a maximum of one overnight stay. It is important to note that the result that comes from collaboration in the field of long-term care, a type of service, a typical activity of the Saint-Pierre Clinic, is of fundamental importance for the entire regional health system. Thanks to the agreement on this service, in fact, the USL Company has twenty beds that it uses to be able to discharge from the Parini Hospital and the Beauregard more quickly, thus contributing to the disposal of the famous flows of patients who are waiting for admission to the hospital from the Emergency Room. The long-term care service at ISAV therefore helps to provide the best possible answers to the management of chronic conditions together with the other intermediate residence facilities already present in the area, such as Variney and Perloz. In order to enhance the activity of clearing waiting lists, at the end of 2023 we adopted a specific regional regulation, introduced with regional law 27/2023, which, among other things, gave ISAV the opportunity to perform general surgery interventions even in ordinary hospitalization, as never before, thanks to the hard work carried out together with the offices. General surgery interventions in ordinary hospitalization were therefore started starting from September 2024 following the conclusion of the administrative procedures for issuing the authorization and accreditation. Coming to question no. 1 ""the number of interventions performed in the year 2024 by private hospital health facilities under agreement, divided by type of intervention"", as we have already explained, the only accredited private hospital facility with which the USL Company has conventional relationships is precisely the Saint-Pierre Clinic. The number of operations performed during 2024 at the Saint-Pierre facility is therefore the following: orthopedic surgery operations, both inpatient and outpatient, 358, data referring to the period from January to July 2024; general surgery operations 177, of which 149 in day surgery, therefore simpler, with a maximum of one night's stay in the period from January to October 2024 and 28 in ordinary regime, therefore general surgery, which can naturally be taken into consideration in the period from September to October 2024 given that general surgery applied at ISAV started in September 2024. Coming to question no. 2 ""the costs in the agreement relating to the various operations"", the agreements between the USL Company and ISAV regarding costs refer to the regional provisions referred to in the resolution of the Council 427 of 2013 with which the general tariff for hospitalization services was approved. The regional resolution details the cost of each homogeneous grouping of diagnoses which therefore represents the unit of measurement of the overall cost of each type of intervention. The resolution also classifies hospital facilities into two classes: A and B. ISAV, due to its characteristics, falls into class B, therefore the one to which the lowest rates apply due to the fact that some services are not present in the facility, such asali the Emergency Room, resuscitation and intensive care, rather than instrumental diagnostics and laboratories active 24 hours. The agreements also provide for the measures of expense reimbursement for ISAV, which ISAV itself owes to the USL Company for the services performed and guaranteed directly by the same. Examples of this include the management of the transfusion service rather than laboratory diagnostics. As regards orthopedic surgery, from January to July 2024, interventions were carried out for a total cost borne by the USL Company of approximately 1,813,000 euros. For general surgery, from January to October in day surgery, therefore the simplest ones with a maximum of one night's stay, the total expense was 176,000 euros. Coming to question no. 3 ""how many patients are currently still on the waiting list for surgical interventions and on the list for general surgery"", according to the data communicated by the USL Company, the patients on the waiting list for a scheduled hospitalization, in all priority classes, as of November 14, 2024 are a total of 5,388, of which 1,466 are on the list for general surgery. Comparing these numbers with those of patients waiting for surgery at the end of 2023 - which were 6,383 patients waiting for ordinary surgery, of which 1,975 for general surgery -, we can argue that the ongoing activities are producing their effectiveness, in fact in 12 months there are 1,000 fewer patients waiting, of which 400 fewer and therefore managed with regards to general surgery. The current data start from the situation described at the end of 2023 and represent a scenario today that, in the meantime, from 1 January 2024, has naturally also absorbed all the new flow generated during the year. Therefore, we do not only make comparisons between static numbers, but also from numbers that in the meantime have naturally seen waiting lists increase during the current year. Coming to question no. 4 ""what are the agreements foreseen in the agreement with respect to eligible patients, in particular what is the procedure for taking charge and the costs requested from patients"", as regards the active agreements between the USL Company and ISAV it is necessary to distinguish two different cases that equally involve two different procedures for taking charge of patients. The first concerns the historical agreements in the orthopedic field, therefore those that have always seen the relationship between Parini and ISAV, which provide for interventions carried out under an institutional regime, that is, at the expense of the regional health service, on patients who are included in the waiting lists directly by ISAV: in this case, users contact the clinic directly and access is permitted upon presentation of a referral. There are therefore no costs required from patients for carrying out surgical interventions, with the exception of any ticket for complex outpatient services. The second case instead concerns the most recent agreements, activated between the USL Company and ISAV, with the aim of strengthening the disposal of the waiting lists of the Parini Hospital. This is the case of general surgery, both the day surgery regime, therefore the simplest ones, and the ordinary hospitalization regime, as well as orthopedic surgery interventions arranged directly by the Orthopedics Department of the Parini Hospital. All this, of course, is the result of the agreements of the last year. In this case, the contractual agreements provide that the complex structures under the jurisdiction of the USL Company, therefore general surgery, orthopedics and traumatology, identify the patients who will be operated on at ISAV among those who are present in the waiting lists for scheduled surgery and who have a homogeneous grouping of diagnoses consistent with the surgical activities that can be carried out at the Saint-Pierre facility. The pre-admission office of the USL Company then contacts the patients following the priority code assigned by the surgeon during the visit and with which they were placed on the waiting list: priority index A, one hospitalization within 30 days, B within 60, C within 180, D within 12 months. The patient is then offered the opportunity to be operated on at the Saint-Pierre Clinic and, in case of consent, the office requires the completion and signing of the consent formto the migration from the waiting list of the Parini Hospital to the list of interventions that can be performed at ISAV. The Pre-admission Office therefore sends ISAV, via an encrypted file, the list of patients to be taken into care, contacting them and carrying out all the activities necessary for the surgical reassessment, pre-admission and subsequent admission. There are no costs required of patients and therefore, in this sense, the activity carried out at the Saint-Pierre Clinic is equivalent to the elective activity carried out at the Hospital. If the patient prefers to be operated at the Parini Hospital, he/she will remain on the waiting list and will always be called according to his/her priority class as soon as a place becomes available."

48013,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976,F,PCP,4,3454,"I believe, Councilor, that you did not miss the first point of my interpellation, which recalled the broadcast ""L'aria che tira"" of November 2, 2024, specifically referring to one of those interventions that could be performed under the agreement. What I ask myself is: who decides the priorities? Because, seeing the broadcast and seeing the documentation brought, there was an absolute priority because this gentleman had already been waiting for over a year, after which I wonder how it is possible that all the things that you highlighted today in the interpellation are not said when the patient calls the department or calls whoever is responsible. You can clearly tell him that he is waiting and not scare him by saying: ""You will have a year ahead of you before an intervention"" if with a high priority there are 30 days, but then we tell him: ""You will have 30 days and you will not have to pay anything"". We have to tell the user this, because what happens in the next piece is very interesting, because, as you said, we do not live in Lombardy or in other regions where there can be some sort of doubt about which clinic this gentleman turned to, because there is one, therefore, from this point of view, it was quite obvious that he was turning to that clinic. So I wonder how it is possible that, if a private individual calls, there is some sort of negotiation, when, as I tell you, the resolution you made with the agreement is very clear and today you also explained all the money that is given precisely for that Agreement and, from this point of view, the patient was perfectly eligible. So I wonder who defines the priorities and at this point I also ask you if you can give me the answer given the complexity of what you told me and above all because people are not informed of the possible path they must follow, because I imagine that if you tell a person: ""But you are in high priority, so you have 30 days"", they have already waited 12 months, waiting 30 days would not have changed their life. Evidently this information - and there is also the part of the phone call right in Surgery - was not represented to them in any way, so evidently there is a lack of communication, which must be made explicit to citizens in some way to avoid things of this type. I hope you do not see this interpellation as one of the pleasant passages of the Regional Council, where almost all the interpellations are addressed to you; most likely because there is a big problem and there are many people who continue to call us, as I imagine you do, to try to report what is happening in Valle d'Aosta, something that has never happened and on which I want to point out that education and healthcare have always been the flagship of our Region, especially because both the pensioner without great resources and the person with many resources could still access services in the same way, today this is no longer the case and they must be accountable. Most likely there is a real lack of communication and above all I also expected a position to be taken with respect to an interview that ended up in a national newspaper, because we certainly did not make a good impression on that matter, because the report also came to me from outside Valle d'Aosta, so I would like to point out that we are certainly not making a good impression on the outside either."

48014,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,5971,"Coming to the first question ""whether the ASL Company has carried out the assessment in relation to the activation in Valle d'Aosta of prostate cancer screening to intercept any neoplasms at the initial stage in the population at greatest risk and failing that when it is expected to be completed"", as was recalled in the preamble to the question, the agenda approved by the Regional Council committed the Regional Government to evaluate, in collaboration with the ASL Company, the activation in Valle d'Aosta of prostate cancer screening to intercept any neoplasms at the initial stage in the population at greatest risk. On 4 November 2024, the ASL Company acknowledged the request of the Department made following the approval of the aforementioned agenda. The Company specified the following in its report. First of all, he pointed out that at the moment only one Region, Lombardy, has planned to start a prostate screening program for that age group, an experience that has not yet begun, it seems it will start in November 2024, having as its sole target subjects born in 1974 and therefore foreseeing a progressive extension to the rest of the male population aged between 50 and 69. Obviously, those born in 1974 in 2024 have turned or will turn fifty. Lombardy reached this determination after a preliminary phase, in which a retrospective study by the Health Protection Agency, ATS of Milan, was organized from 2018 to 2023, a pilot project, a questionnaire for access to prostate screening, working groups - we recall the one regarding the minimum technological requirements, i.e. the acquisition and reporting of magnetic resonance examinations - and an operational protocol. The company explains that trials in this area of ​​cancer prevention are extremely rare for various reasons. First of all, clinicians point out that screening based on prostate-specific antigen, the so-called ""PSA"", remains a controversial topic due to the high rate of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment, which make the ratio between desired and undesirable effects of early diagnosis unfavorable, as PSA is not specific to tumor cells. It is possible, for example, to detect high values ​​of prostate antigen in cases of hypertrophy or infection without the presence of neoplasms. In fact, the problem is to correctly evaluate a possible positive result, as a high PSA does not mean that there is a tumor, or that it is more or less aggressive, or that surgery is necessary: ​​it only means that the person who tests positive deserves further tests in order to reach a correct diagnostic-therapeutic decision. Recently, a periodic urological visit and a specific instrumental examination, namely parametric magnetic resonance imaging, have been introduced as a complement to the investigation - and are mentioned in the screening protocol for prostate cancer in Lombardy in cases at high risk for PSA - which should be repeated annually. The Local Health Authority, following an evaluation of its clinicians, namely the screening referents, urologists and radiologists, therefore confirms all the doubts related to a similar methodology that uses a specific antigen. Clinicians maintain that it would be desirable to wait for a targeted examination that has the characteristics of contributing to early diagnosis with a smaller number of false positives and/or negatives, thus allowing patients to be treated sooner and better. I also report what was recently stated by Professor Francesco Montorsi, full professor of Urology at the Vita Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, who stated: ""The topic is delicate, it is important to keep in mind that, faced with a positive PSA result, it is not a given that there is a tumor and that treatment is not always necessary and it is always necessary to evaluate what is best for each patient, for each health service, remaining firm in the perspective of avoiding unnecessary interventions"". At the moment we therefore believe that, in light of the evaluations carried out by our clinicians, it is appropriate to remain carefully informed on the results of the Lombardy trial and above all on an ongoing project of the National Center for Prevention and Control.rollo delle malattie, the CCM 2023, funded by the Ministry of Health, which is entitled ""Evaluation of the feasibility of organized programs on prostate screening and their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriateness of the use of the PSA test in the Italian context"" and which lasts two years, with partners: the Institute for the Study, Prevention and Oncology Network, therefore the ISPRO, the Azienda USL Toscana Centro TC, the Reference Center for Epidemiology and Oncological Prevention in Piedmont (the CPO), the ATS Pavia, the Lombardy Region, the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, the Azienda USL IRCCS of Reggio Emilia, the USL of Modena and the Puglia Region. The CCM project will carry out an evaluation of the feasibility and opportunity of implementing organized programs on prostate screening and an evaluation of their effectiveness in reducing the inappropriateness of the use of the PSA test in the Italian context. The CCM 2023 project will also provide the opportunity to develop a new generation of pilot studies on prostate screening and active surveillance studies of low-grade tumors that will be implemented after the project. This project was presented at the meeting of the board of the National Screening Observatory on November 8, 2024. Both the representatives of the Department and those of the Aosta Valley Local Health Authority participate in these periodic meetings on a regular basis."

48014,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Igiene e sanità pubblica",en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964,M,FI,4,2526,"Thank you Councilor for the response you read to us that was prepared by the Local Health Authority following the agenda that was approved on July 23, 2024 regarding the request to make an assessment on the activation of screening. In this regard, first of all I would ask you if it is possible to have a copy of what you read to us, because, being a highly technical topic, it also becomes difficult to grasp the details on the fly during the illustration of the topic. From a political perspective, we appreciate the initiative that Lombardy has implemented because first of all it is an action of prevention and awareness on the topic, a topic that affects many people of the male gender and, as recommended by the European Union, we believe it is important to strengthen these screenings. It is a very widespread issue throughout the country, in 2023 there were 41,100 diagnoses, in 2022 8,200 deaths, it is the first cause of death from cancer in the male population. Therefore, from what we have heard, it emerges that it would not be appropriate at this time to go in this direction because this screening activity would lead to highlighting a series of false positives that would then increase difficulties and would put a burden on the local health authority for further investigations that are probably linked to inflammation or other pathologies. We believe that saving a life is important and therefore also in screening we must also run the risk of having situations highlighting false positives, which can then be addressed with further investigations, because many lives could be saved through early management of the problem from a health perspective. We will look carefully at this topic because it is a topic that is close to our hearts and we would not like to end up being the last in Italy, even if at this moment this activity has only been activated by the Lombardy Region, which I believe has made all the necessary assessments, also from a scientific point of view, because especially in a reality of that size, which is much larger than ours, it would have much higher repercussions than those you described at the level of our reality, which is a smaller reality and which could also, from certain points of view, behave differently because there are situations that can be managed better on small numbers."

48015,XVI,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Azienda Regionale Sanitaria - U.S.L.",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975,M,SA,2,3415,"Coming to the question ""to know the reasons that to date have not yet allowed the Aosta Valley Health Authority, as announced, to permanently activate a medical car with a dedicated emergency driver and doctor at the Verrès outpatient clinic and the timeframes for its definitive activation"", as we have already reported at the Regional Council meeting of 19 June, we confirm that the Company is working to complete the activation of the medical car service at the Verrès outpatient clinic. The Aosta Valley Health Authority has in fact informed that, following a specific inspection, the reference spaces for the service have been identified and made available and that some adjustments to the premises are currently being defined, as requested by the Prevention and Protection Service of the Company itself. More precisely, two separate rooms have been made available: one for the emergency driver, one for the doctor, men and women. One of the two rooms is currently used by the Company's veterinary service and the person in charge of the territorial emergency, Dr. Cavoretto, whom we thank, reported that he found maximum collaboration from the contact person for the veterinary services, Dr. Ragionieri, whom we thank in turn, who immediately made themselves available to reorganize the spaces for their services. They also reported that the Verrès rescue volunteers, in the spirit of collaboration, gave maximum availability by making spaces dedicated to the car available. As we have already reported, we recall that in recent months the territorial emergency/urgency services have been the subject of a complete reorganization starting from the successful strengthening of helicopter rescue activities also during night-time trips. In this sense, we recall that our helicopter rescue and secondary helicopter transport services also intervene in the border areas in the Piedmont region with destination to the hospitals of the same Region. We also recall that this topic was, among other things, the subject of a broad and fruitful discussion with the Health Councillor of the Piedmont Region during the meeting held last 10 September in an institutional format. Due to the overall reorganisation of services in the territory and the new scenarios that have been created, it was therefore considered that the reference location for the medical car was appropriately identified at the Verrès polyclinic. In Donnas the service is guaranteed during the day by a medicalised ambulance and during the night by an ambulance with an emergency/urgency nurse. The location of the medical car, equipped with a rescue driver and a dedicated doctor at the Verrès polyclinic, which is equidistant between the Châtillon and Donnas locations, therefore presents itself as a strategic solution aimed at ensuring timely interventions throughout the valley floor area, including the surrounding side valleys. The medical car, in fact, during its shift from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am, can effectively support the nursing figures present on the ambulances that are in Châtillon and Donnas, who, as we have said, are qualified in emergency/urgency skills."

We, as a group, have presented this question simply because you, Councilor, had planned, as you well recalled, a medical car with a driver and rescuer in Verrès, but to date it is not there, I refer to the interpellation of June 19 n. 3744, where you, in response to my initiative, replied: ""From next July, at the Verrès polyclinic, a medical car with a driver, rescuer and a dedicated doctor will be permanently active currently in Donnas"". Obviously, as I have been able to ascertain, this medical car does not exist. Therefore, taking into account the will of your Department to guarantee effective assistance and urgency in the Lower Valley, we feel it is our duty to remind you of this. You spoke of the efficiency of the helicopter, which we agree with. To stay on topic, I would like to highlight the need of the users of the Lower Valley to create, in addition to the Community Hospital, also a first aid point, essential for a first aid intervention. We have highlighted it several times in this Council and also the colleague highlighted it perhaps two weeks ago, so I would like to highlight it too. Finally, I would like to remind you that the voluntary associations, important figures in managing the emergency/urgency, work in close collaboration with the Health Authority, guaranteeing a first aid service throughout the regional territory, but this important service requires an efficient health network. At this point, all we can do is wait for the medical car in Verrès."

Following the approval of regional law 7/2024, which reintroduced the contribution for the construction of the property in question, the offices of the Tourism Entities and Professions structure have begun preparing the implementing provisions aimed at regulating the methods of granting and disbursing the benefit, also with the support of the regional Expropriations and Valorization of Heritage and Casino structure, which I would like to thank - on the occasion of this answer - for the valuable collaboration that has been given to us. The resolution containing the implementing provisions was approved during the meeting of the Council on 14 November and identifies the date of 27 November as the deadline for the submission of the request for contribution by the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association. It was passed in the Regional Council on November 14 because the last opinion, the one that had to be issued by the ""State Aid"" structure, related to the de minimis issue, arrived on November 7. The Valdostana Ski Instructors Association, for its part, has prepared the technical-economic feasibility project and, following the adoption of the approved implementing provisions, is preparing the application for funding, which, as I said previously, must be filed by November 27. Following the submission of the application, the offices will carry out the necessary investigation with respect to the documentation presented and the work to be carried out, following which they will prepare the resolution of the Regional Council approving the investment in question and granting the relative contribution; resolution whose approval must obviously take place by December 31 and will include the commitment of expenditure. With a management provision subsequent to the resolution, the sums in question will be committed to the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association, beneficiary of the contribution referred to in Article 28 of Regional Law 23/2024, and disbursed according to the methods set out in the aforementioned resolution 1394 of 14 November last. At that point, the Aosta Valley Ski Instructors Association will be able to initiate all the actions necessary for the construction of the aforementioned property."

48017,XVI,CREDITO,en,Lavy,Erik,1995,M,LEGA VDA,2,3499,"Here is another piece of the puzzle that was evoked yesterday regarding depopulation, banking desertification. The news of the closure of the Etroubles bank branch, which remained the only one in Coumba Freida, and also of the closure of the Antey-Saint-André bank branch is now over a month old... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...and also of Brusson says the Councilor. Then there will be the next closure of the Morgex branch; this news is absolutely negative, especially for non-digital natives, whose number is not so small anyway. Let's start from a premise: that these banking institutions are not public bodies, so rightly on the one hand they make their choices, their autonomy however often clashes with the needs of citizens, at least in several municipalities, which perhaps do not have such a large population, who, once the branch is closed, have to travel dozens and even dozens of kilometers to use a service. The data on the so-called ""bank desertification"" are alarming. According to UILCA, UIL Credito, Esattorie ed Assicurazioni, in Italy from 2018 to 2023 bank branches decreased by 20.7%, 5,248 less in five years, the Municipalities served by banks decreased by 13.4% and the employees of the branches also suffered a decrease of 6%. Again according to UILCA, which has also carried out some interesting surveys, nine out of ten people are dissatisfied with the closure of bank branches in their municipality and a good five out of ten declare that they go to a bank at least once a month. Seven out of ten people also declare that they have felt the lack of a bank branch in their municipality quite or very much. But why do banks decide to close their branches? Essentially for three reasons: the first is the reduction of costs, so they tend to close where there are fewer users in terms of population. Then there is the second reason which is the banking aggregations that have been made and a third reason: that of digitalization, because Internet Banking is increasingly used. Obviously, these arguments cannot be made on the skin of the citizens. Focusing a little more directly on the Aosta Valley, we have today 40 thousand Aosta Valley residents who reside in municipalities that do not register the presence of any bank in their territory; over a third of Aosta Valley residents, who have been deprived of access to bank branches from 2015 to today, therefore less than ten years, 18,500 Aosta Valley residents who reside in municipalities that have only one bank branch and 68% of Aosta Valley municipalities that do not have bank branches in their territory. These are data from the CISL Banking Desertification Observatory. Precisely because banking institutions are not public bodies, the room for maneuver is limited, but I believe that an attempt at least to understand the reasons why these bank branches are closed is absolutely necessary. We therefore ask with this initiative, in addition to a series of even more recent data, if there is the will to start a discussion table together with the Mayors, the Consumer Associations, with the heads of the credit institutions to understand in some way their reasons for the closure of these banking institutions in the territory and also understand what tools could be used to keep those open and, if necessary, encourage the creation of new ones."
48017,XVI,CREDITO,en,Bertin,Alberto,1966,M,Presidente,3,37,The President of the Region responds.
48017,XVI,CREDITO,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968,M,UV,4,7389,"The requests of colleague Lavy concern the current number of bank branches and ATMs in the regional territory and how many bank branches and ATMs have been closed in the last three years and in which Municipalities. With regard to the statistical data of the 2024 annual report on the regional economy of the Bank of Italy, it can be seen that in 2013 there were fifteen banks present in the Valley with their own branches, in 2022 fourteen and in 2023 thirteen banks. With regard to the branches, the numbers are as follows: in 2013 there were ninety-nine bank branches in the regional territory, in 2022 they had dropped to sixty-eight and in 2023 to sixty-seven. The bank branches currently present in Valle d'Aosta, as per information provided by the branch of the Bank of Italy, are sixty-five, the ATMs are one hundred and thirty-seven, the latest available data for 2023. As for the closures, in 2021 there were sixty-eight branches, so there were three closures: one in Aosta, one in Issogne and one in Etroubles, while the number of ATMs in 2023, one hundred and thirty-seven, is the same as in 2021. This decrease in the number of branches is however slightly better, but in line with the overall Italian data, which sees bank branches decrease from 31,761 in 2013 to 20,161 in 2023. The Bank of Italy report then photographs another data, namely that the Municipalities served by banks in Valle d'Aosta were thirty-four in 2013 and twenty-four are in 2023, a data affected by the small numbers of the our reality, but in line with the trend in Italy which sees the Municipalities served by banks increased from 5,846 in 2013 to 4,651 in 2023. The Bank of Italy report also provides data of the opposite sign, as one can imagine. Home banking services, as also partially reported in the Councilor's evaluation, for families per 100 inhabitants in Valle d'Aosta went from 45.2% in 2013 to 78.3% in 2023 and online transfers reached 88.8% of the total and were less than 54% in 2013. The data on Bancoposta branches is also of the opposite sign, going from fifty-seven in 2013 to sixty-six in 2023, similarly to what happened throughout Italy. First of all, I would like to thank the Aosta branch of the Bank of Italy, in particular the deputy head, Dr. Paolo Emilio Mistroli, who allowed us to analyze this data and provided us with updates to respond in the most timely manner possible. As for the third question instead: ""if there is the intention, together with the Mayors and Consumer Associations, to start a discussion table with the heads of credit institutions to avoid the closure of bank branches and ATMs"", in the annual report from 2023 Banca d'Italia has dedicated a specific study to this topic, highlighting how between 2015 and 2022 the number of bank branches, in relation to residents, has decreased by 27%, in line with what happened throughout the Eurozone and not only in Italy, referring to this study, available on the Banca d'Italia website for other data, such as, for example, the presence of post offices, which mean that the overall number of municipalities in the Aosta Valley, without any banking service, drops to nine. However, in relation to the third question, it seems important to point out that the decrease in bank branches is due to the search for efficiency by operators, to which have been added the effects of technological innovations and new payment habits. In short, not only in Valle d'Aosta but throughout Europe the territorial network of banks has been downsized and one could even say that the banking sector is the last to arrive if one thinks of the progressive reduction or closure that began over twenty years ago of territorial offices and other services of general interest such as telephony, gas or other services of state and public order. This said, also from direct experience, the discussions regarding the presence of branches on the territory and a comparison that discounts wide-ranging corporate policies with multinationals that have no roots in the territory and with which the opportunities for comparison on the part of the Administrations are really very limited, if not non-existent. Furthermore, we add a strong implementation of electronic payment equipment, which now concerns almost allà of the economic, tourist and commercial realities of our, like other territories, which over time have destroyed the intermediation function of banks, as well as their increasingly specialized functions, which dedicate specialized personnel to the various categories of customers; customers who in most cases are reached at their businesses or residences or followed by appointment in a flexible manner, also in this case eliminating the need for a widespread territorial office. Then there are actions by institutions that seek efficiency, which often simply means cost reduction in the face of an implementation of standardized services. In this sense, the activity of the Region and the Institutions towards credit institutions also aims to create payment methods and procedures that facilitate remote services, with the use of specific applications and operating methods that can be implemented by mobile banking, which can neutralize the decline in classic territorial services. What we can do and have always done in Valle d'Aosta is to implement a series of actions necessary to keep the entire territory alive, inhabited and, consequently, interesting for operators and service providers such as banks. In short, I believe that the opportunities that are already implemented and the requests that are periodically put forward by the Municipalities, together with the Region, but mainly by the Municipalities, which once had slightly sharper weapons to be able to incentivize credit institutions to place a counter or an ATM in their territory, mainly linked to treasury services, which gave banks the opportunity to enter the fabric, including the socio-economic, of the territory and thus be able to grab a part of the customers... today these mechanisms are surpassed by other technologies and other innovations and even these opportunities, which were available to the Municipalities, with their resources and with their ability to provide a service to the community through a bank counter, are weakening. The contact is always there, it is there anyway and it is evidently à la une, especially on the part of the territorial entities, but in fact the change also in habits must lead us to work more on what can be facilitations, also in preparation for those who must re-adapt their system to the evolution of the services offered by the banking system. This is somewhat in line with what the Regional Administration is also doing to try to insert into the banking circuits a whole series of opportunities, also of direct relationship with the Administration, regarding, for example, payments or other situations that can directly touch the context of the Regional Administration in particular."

Having bank branches means having a service on the territory. Now you have started to say that rightly the world is moving forward, there is innovation, there is also a change in habits and that therefore in the end we are in trend with the national level, we are also in trend at a European level, so who cares if they close a few bank branches, we are moving forward, it doesn't matter. Internet Banking is increasing and it would be interesting to understand if the percentage increase in people who use Internet Banking is a will or an obligation, because it is obvious that, if they close some bank branches in Coumba Freida, it is normal that then users must somehow learn to use other systems if they do not want to be left dry. She said it: we went from ninety-nine branches to sixty-five in about 10 years. So, if they are a service, that's one thing, if they are not a service, she said, also with a view to saving costs, let's do it like this... (intervention of a Councilor off microphone) ...not the Region, because obviously the Region has nothing to do with it in this case, but we invite the banking institutions, in the name of saving, to close all the branches in the Valley, let's make the bank branches only in Aosta and we are all happy if then the issue is about saving costs. Then she said another interesting thing: that today the discussion with the banking institutions is non-existent, but with this initiative she asks if there is the will to set up a table, precisely to ensure that this discussion can be born. No, that's not good, it makes no sense to carry on with this discussion, when instead, for example, the Liguria Region, and also other Regions, have set up real Observatories on the issue of banking desertification. Now that they can have more or less positive effects of impact on avoiding closure is another matter, but there is a minimum of more attention. Here we pretend nothing is happening, that everything is fine, but yes, in the meantime we move forward, technology moves forward, innovation moves forward, who cares if the inhabitants of Brusson in the Coumba Freida of Antey have one less branch, we must necessarily move forward in the face of those who perhaps must remain in those Municipalities and do not have the possibility, due to age or due to many situations, to have access to Internet Banking. Honestly I would say make peace with your brain, yesterday you said something about maintaining services, today that a system is proposed to somehow not say to block, but to have a consultation with the institutions that provide services this is not good, it is useless.

We found that from the published news it seems that there are only five public toilets for a surface area of ​​approximately 35 kilometers. We emphasize that the numerous excellences and historical-cultural beauties present in Aosta have always been important strengths regarding the tourist offer of the Aosta Valley and, in particular, right within the regional capital for years several important events have also been organized, also in collaboration with the involvement and support of the regional Administration. Taking into account that, despite the territorial jurisdiction, therefore also the planning and implementation of the various services is the responsibility of the Municipality of Aosta, we believe that it is appropriate, for the reasons indicated in the premises, that the competent regional departments can commit to verifying the presence or absence of such criticality in the territory and, if necessary, can request greater attention and collaboration from the Municipality of Aosta, with the aim of being able to offer a better quality of general services offered by our well-known regional tourist resort. The competent Councilors are therefore asked to find out if they are aware of such news and if the reported statements correspond to reality. If in the case of an affirmative answer to the first question, there is the intention to engage in a proactive dialogue with the Municipal Administration of Aosta so that they can try to improve the overall offer of services present in the territory of the capital."

Joke aside, I confess that I was not aware of the press reports to which the questioner refers, so I am not able to say whether the information corresponds to reality. However, the interpellation correctly anticipates it: the issue is not exactly the responsibility of the Regional Administration. I do not want to downplay the importance from the point of view of the tourist usability of the regional capital, but it should be noted, for example, that, on the occasion of demonstrations or events supported or sponsored by the Regional Administration, the placement of chemical toilets is one of the organizational and economic aspects, also in the strict sense of supporting expenditure, significant, given attention and carefully planned. For the rest, the Municipalities are not subject to protection or direction by the Region, but I am sure that those responsible for the regional capital will have taken note of the same press considerations that you have seen and will assume the relevant decisions. As regards the dialogue between the Departments, which from time to time collaborate with the Administration of the capital, I can guarantee that the management of the overall logistics is assumed by the organization of the various events, which evidently goes to size, in many cases also for questions, even before anything else, of security, the various services useful for the best use of the event. The dialogue between the municipal and regional structures, each for the aspects of their own competence, is in any case a practice obviously always followed and practiced, as well as indispensable to be able to guarantee good results and I am sure that we will continue to work on this with attention and professionalism, enthusiasm and maximum collaboration between all the bodies to improve even situations that are not at the top, such as those reported by the Councilor."

You simply have to go on Google, therefore on the most technological tools that are often reiterated even at the level of the Department, even by the competent Councilor, precisely how important the issue of innovation in digitalization is, therefore how important it is to have these increasingly performing tools. We must believe in it with words, but then also in reality they must work. If you go on Google, you see that there are five icons of the services, two of which say open, where there are three, there are three of the same bathroom and even one, for example, go to the one of the station and you see that it says: ""Closed, opens Friday morning at 06:00"", as if one needs that service from 06:00 in the morning onwards and not during other hours.

The point was that we referred to the competent Departments because we believed that it could be the Sapinet Councilor, in collaboration, for example, also with the Tourism Councilor, given the contents of the premises, but the response from him that made a summary on the subject is fine. The initiative was presented at the beginning of November and just a few days ago, on November 18, as you also know, the news came out: ""Italia Oggi: Aosta, 22nd for quality of life, the regional capital loses 13 positions and, to determine these positions, reference is made to services and infrastructures, so we are not completely out of place with the initiative, but unfortunately the criticality is there, even if it is not completely of regional competence. The same speech, browsing topics that concern the initiative... if we go and see, at the end of December the same topic was discussed within the Municipal Council of Aosta where with a motion the theme of the criticality and scarcity of these services that exist within the regional capital was presented and the same competent Councilor of a municipal majority that for the most part reflects the same majority in terms of composition of the one we have here at the regional level, admits and says that there will be a decisive intervention on the matter. A year later, we ask ourselves if we have really and concretely worked in this direction, because obviously, if there are critical issues, we must also all try to resolve them together and this is a matter. Above all, we reiterate the issue of the quality of services, we mean precisely that attention in monitoring the most modern technologies available to us: Google and all the APPs that are available to us today. We therefore welcome the last part of your answer, but the invitation is precisely to create synergy so that even these critical issues, which are often considered trivial or subdued, in the end we cannot also rent chemical toilets every time, because in any case they are also costs. If on the one hand we manage to resolve, making services stable and well-established with the necessary financial investments, we certainly manage to improve these services to the advantage of the Region, to the advantage of its image, at a national and international level."
