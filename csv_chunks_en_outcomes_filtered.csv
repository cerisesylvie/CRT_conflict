47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,2,9265,"This motion has been present on the agenda of the regional council for a long time, however it always has its topicality, indeed, most likely in the premises we could have added even the other, so it is a motion that again wants to bring and draw the attention to the need for updates and clarity regarding the expansion of the Parini hospital complex, a project that - we said it in 2021, when we resigned precisely for this reason - is of fundamental importance for the community for the community. Valley, so let's go back to 2021, because it is useful to remember all the steps. Recall that in 2021 during the discussion of the petition of the Vallée Santé Committee, not our resolution had been voted, although it had been voted in the commission, after which the five colleagues who left our group decided to follow another road, a resolution that asked for, urged the activation of a working table between the institutions, therefore between the region, the Municipality of Aosta and the designers, with the aim of verifying the technical, economic. and temporal of the project, especially in the light of the new challenges that emerged with the pandemic. This resolution, we remember, committed to proceeding with the variant of the executive project of the East of the Hospital, to continue the design phases of the renovation of the current hospital at the same time and end the definition and identification of the hospital services that would also have been activated taking into account the Pandemic, to start a comparison on the destination of the Beauregard hospital and the former motherhood, to present the project to the Valdostan population through more appropriate tools. Since then, a room has appeared right adjacent to the hospital, an info point, just close to the construction site, which I think you do not find great participation, I often pass in front of the hospital and I have never seen anyone within that small room and above all, seeing the slides that pass, if we are interested in the archaeological excavations, surely it is of great interest what is inside that video, but, if we are interested in what concerns the Valdostana health. We find. Many initiatives have been made mainly by our group and by the Valdôtain's Rassemblement Group to ask that, following that hearing on April 10, there were updates, this because I went to see me again that hearing, to recover the various steps and, apart from the fact that the designers were not present, so only this would deserve an audition, but on the other hand I also went to take that documents and to check that documents. Then arrived precisely following that audition and I can say that many of the questions we asked in that hearing have not found any answer to date: an example - of course I take the passages referring to my intervention - I asked to have an analysis on the adequacy of the operating beds and the consequences of the articulation of the hospital facilities, this because at a certain point, during the audition, there had been a question of double radiology, therefore a radiology in the old Parini. In the expansion, it was not well understood, even in light of the questions asked by the director Manfrin, what was the fate, for example, of the pharmacy, therefore on this point we absolutely had no answers. After that we also focused on the question of the limitations referring to the Elisuperficie in which we know well it will be put above the hospital, but we know the same, with limitations, to a flight a day compared to the possibility of landing on that structure. Then there were also questions from the director Lucianaz who had not been given an answer and that perhaps he will present him. I imagine that the commissioner will tell us: ""I have already come in the hearing on April 10"", if you think that the hearing of April 10 ... moreover there was also an intervention by the councilor Marquis, who said: ""but to make an audition without the designs, without having a knowledge of what is being done makes little sense"", therefore, even under the design point of view, most likely ... but this is the field of the councilor, Compared to those passages that had occurred on April 10 and that, in essence, gave space to new auditions, this is what seemed to us to grasp, or in any case also to send new documentation that we asked for that location. We then take the obligation to remember that, after that audition of April 10, thanks to the various initiatives, we learned from Councilor Marzi, on February 9, 2024 we had been told that the validation of the executive project was close to the conclusion. On 11 July 2024, therefore a few months later - the ""neighbor"" perhaps depending on the speaker is subjective -, again it was said: ""No, but it is a question of very little"". From that February 9 to 15th eight months have passed and over three years have passed since 2021. Moreover, as I remembered, during the discussion of that petition it had also said: ""No, but we must continue with the project, meanwhile with the design phases of phase 4 and 5, because so we have an idea of ​​the total costs for the entire hospital"", because, in my opinion, it is good to remember that the expansion will be only for the hospital for acute, so it is not everything we need. Nothing has been said about the fate of the Beauregard, even on this we have not had updates and also on the fate of the former motherhood, all things placed within that petition. With this motion, therefore, we ask the Councilor for Health Councilor to come to the Com Commission, perhaps even with all the documentation, within 15 days -because it seems to us that, given that over 8 months have passed, even if we put a rather short time, we can make it -, to come to present the verification on technical -progery and economic compatibility, as well as on the realization in adequate chronological terms of the expansion project of the Parini hospital. This is essentially that was foreseen in the resolution and of course also to present all the design variants and the state of the art of work in the different hospital principals, because the only certainty we have is that the Aosta Valley will never have a single garrison, this is the only thing that the Aosta Valley health workers asked and it is the only thing we know we will never have. We have also seen the resolution of November 4 that speaks to us of 178 million and here too we repeat that it is only the expansion and the designs, therefore not everything that is needed, therefore it would also be interesting to understand what the total costs are, if we have an idea, what the expansion costs, the demolition of the superfits, all the renovation of the old Parini, the construction of the maternal center, the movement of psychiatry and the movement. He puts on it and even when you think of ending all this, because one of the things we had highlighted and we continue to say is that we had absolutely needed the hospital and had to be decentralized, it had to be unique, it had to be ready soon. At this moment, however, we know very little. As I said, we surely know that it will not be a unique garrison, but we know anything about everything else. Maybe the commissioner knows, maybe he can already tell him today, but what we want is that he returns to the hearing in the meantime to provide the documentation requested on April 10 that we are still waiting, but then to ask the questions, because just go to see that hearing to understand that, having no idea what was inside that hospital, very few questions could be asked, so having the idea of ​​the beds. I also read - however, having been downloaded only today, I read the resolution quickly this morning - that in essence the Municipality of Aosta rushed problems with respect to traffic and on the other hand asked that the planned parking lots were also for use for other needs, therefore not only for those who went to the hospital, but for those who want to visit the city of Aosta, therefore also to understand respect not only to traffic, but we know how to be in the places we know. What will be the priorities that have placed in the project, because there was talk of two parking spaces every bed, it is normal that, if anyone can park there, those two parking spaces will most likely no longer exist. These are all questions that cannot be restricted in a debate of a motion and this is why we ask, for the umpteenth time, to come to the commission to present this project and all the vision that this majority has compared to this work, which, as I said, is of extreme necessity and which is becoming, according to our point of view, the greatest flop of this majority, but this is our vision. Let's see what the commissioner will answer us and we will also evaluate the next steps."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,4,11015,"Bondzor in Tcheutte. [Literal translation from the patois: good morning everyone]. The requests of colleague Guichardaz are sacrosanct, clarifications are asked for in the commission. Unfortunately it is a record that feels too often on this topic, but with the permission of my group leader, taking the floor, I must still give a little explanation for what happened yesterday. Yesterday I did not respond to a colleague who apostrophized me with a ""sucks, be ashamed"", etc., because I considered it decidedly absurd, instead, seeing today the unleashing of printing articles, at least on the classroom and to the listener, I owe two explanations, starting from the fact that yesterday I was commenting with a colleague of mine, certainly aloud, the fact of the methods of granting the word and I had no epithetic Word ... but so Padovani ... (intervention by the councilor Padovani, out of the microphone) also face sarcasm, colleague, but I do not listen to the stupid who says she, so don't worry. For this fact, I was condemned by several printing bodies, in particular the Aosta Valley agencies, the Pd resonance speakers and, patience, it is not the first time that these printing agencies report untrue facts, such as the continuous reference to the ""great straw"" that I would have pronounced in 2022, I have never affirmed a ""large straw"", but it continues to be reported with a virtue. With the colleague, however, yesterday we clarified, I believe in a peaceful and reasonable way, I also told him that, if you think it is offended, I apologize, I tell him publicly, I was not addressing him, so I think for me that it can end here. And if I have to other justifications, I have no problem supporting him. However, I believe that, chatting with a colleague, he can at least have the right to use the words I think. I repeat: with the colleague there was nothing and the epithet was not addressed to him, then everyone considers the fact as they like. The article instead signed by Piero Minuzzo I take the time to reread it because it seems to me quite worrying. I speak of the hospital and I come to the motion because on 4 December 2023 in the hearing at the Municipality of Aosta we heard several city councilors complaining about the fact that the technicians do not give answers, certain times and precise data were asked that even on that occasion they were provided, fortunately, that the auditions of the Municipality of Aosta are public, so we can cite them, true, president? Another opposition councilor expressed in front of the engineer who was relating: ""It is difficult to make a political debate without the presence of the counterparty, since the technicians act on the mandate, I would have made me very please to see the regional policy here"", other Renaissance group interventions, etc., therefore also the Municipality of Aosta have not been provided the answers that in this advice continues to ask. Let's go on, in the sense that, remembering that the executive design of the hospital of the new wing of the expansion was from 2013, I repeat: the executive planning then in 2014 the regional council stopped it, then the archaeological finds, etc. ... We have a declaration of the engineer who was planned to deliver the hospital in December 2019, you all know this, the newspapers also know. The fact is that they continue to ask for data that are not provided. This week we learn that with the modest sum of 178 and a half million the expansion of the Parini hospital is expected, therefore, in addition to the documentation that we hope will be provided, otherwise we will try to have it differently, in addition to the 31 -page report - and then I will resume some passages of this report -, wonders if these 178.5 million euros focus on the expansion, on the part of the Block K and Hospital Street, Excavation still to be programmed for the archaeological aspect allowing and here I would like to know by the councilor what it intends to do in that area that has not yet been excavated. He therefore wonders normally, and we will also ask for it in the commission, as much as the total of the works of the whole Parini complex will amount, including phases 4 and 5 of which we have absolutely no documentation. To return to block K, I remember that in the commission, that famous April 10, several questions have been raised, not all of them got answered, some summarize some to refresh the memory of the councilor, that is, if on the top floor of the Hospital Street, which houses a conference room, refreshment services and other things, if it means the floor below the connection tunnel between the two buildings and here it has not been replied; Where the bus would stop, if it narrows the roadway, indeed, the roadway often, for the works, will be restricted to a single lane and wondered where the bus stop was, where they crossed the pedestrians, if the sidewalks were not foreseen, on the rendering they are not indicated, as will be made to cross Viale Geneva in satin and how long the use of the second lane in Viale Ginevra will be expected. Here we have not obtained answers. The Hospital Street includes paths already separated in the pandemic perspective that had been so talked about in the Covid phase and the same for the emergency room, we have not obtained guarantees during that hearing. Did you still ask for vehicular access inside Parini, will it undergo changes during the construction of the Hospital Street? We know, at least so the engineer told us that the Hospital Street will be made of three sections, moving from time to time the current entrance to the hospital. It would be good to have somewhat clearer ideas. What do we know about their location from 118 which is currently near the concierge? The underground excavation for the passage of the pipelines will still be wondered, without obtaining answers, which will connect the Block K from the technological control unit, if the excavations are expected to find the stone circle in that area, as indicated by the International Scientific Commission, if the construction is expected in that area, so to speak, near the withdrawal center, of another archaeological area, as it seems evident, there is an archaeological finding. This was not given an answer and I speak of April, so more than six months have passed. It was still asked if the hospital complex, painted as conceived to position itself at the top of the energy and environmental sustainability parameters, I ask if the renovated Parini, therefore phases 4 and 5, is also planned there a photovoltaic system, machines and systems with very high performance, advanced sensoristic supervision systems, efficient envelope systems integrated with bioclimatic solutions, This has not achieved response as on stages 4 and 5 there is a total darkness on government decisions. We would like, since we talk about the new hospital, to have answers also on these sectors but have never been provided. Then the trees, the green area around this hospital but where do you foresee it? The only green thing on the rendering is the roof of the colored green buildings, but I wonder: does this seem to you a serious hospital? Again: from the images of the preliminary design of the old Mauritian, that is, the building that should be renovated and made full as it was at the origin ... I remember that the Aosta Hospital is a fascist work par excellence, in the images, those few and very rare images we have seen, has not been provided its original identity, so will the Mauriziano be placed as original or will there be superfits? Also on this, Councilor, it would be the case, after six months from that skimpy 31 -page report, even with several contacts, as we have pointed out during that hearing, which provided us with some responses. I still have a few minutes and I take advantage of it to talk about the parking lots, which have been reduced by 50%, I repeat, the parking measures are, from what I understood, of 4.20 meters, know that a compass Mercedes is 4.95 meters long, a pickup 5.20 meters, I would like to see how we can park them in that underground parking and all the other stalls have not yet understood where we get them. In a project there was a parking lot in the south-west area of ​​the current hospital, the technological control unit will now be built, I would really like to understand, and we have never been provided with an answer, where the creation of these stalls is expected. Finish with the enchanting, the incanstation is spoken of little and it will be the big problem if the work of this construction site will ever begin. Here we have a sequence of regulations to be respected, the rules on prevention, on compliance with safety, 2008 decree, the protection of hygiene on site is fundamental and I speak of law 300, we have the law that regulates the quality public works: the 109/1994, which requires the control by the administration at the inspection level, for evaluation of the projects by the contracting authority. The set of the two aforementioned regulations obliges a preventive verification to prevent the company's entrustment of the work from blocking the works, rightly demanding the impossibility of accessing construction site areas for supplies to perform the work. The engineer told us that the area intended for parking will be used initially, but I will point out to you, councilor, you should know, that there is a legislation that regulates the accidents and hygiene of the insiders, who, to be in order, will have to provide a series of prefabricated containers used as bathrooms, changing rooms, warehouses, offices, meeting room for works, refectory, which entails in the construction site. The occupation of a considerable part of the construction site area of ​​the parking lots that was indicated for the first phase of the works. Then there is the quality control during the works, where the obligation applies, in order not to be ousted from subsequent contracts, to comply with the control and differentiated storage of all the material used in the construction site. This therefore obliges the company to prepare adequate separate areas with each other, where to deposit everything, that the breaks and defects of the material are in perfect rule, etc. There is internal circulation, interference areas, loading and unloading, an impressive thing in that hole. You want to continue to make it there, you have embedded, it is your choice, they will pay the aostans and all the Aosta Valleys this disservice, starting with the same bikes that cannot even be brought inside the hospital, imagine the circulation, with trucks that must download, work means, material storage areas that you will have to identify in some area of ​​Aosta, etc. The criticality is enormous, at least it comes to report in the commission as required by this motion."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,6,7471,"Before making an analysis from Genesis to Apocalypse, thinking of themes that are not the subject of the initiative, in my humble opinion, and this is why I intervene under the general discussion, it is important to give merit and respect a motion, n. 19, which has premises and demanding. As you rightly recalled, I connect Guichardaz, it is not his fault if the motion arrives now, but it is not even my fault, so I reply Sic Stanitbus rebus to date. On Monday 4 November 2024, a date, among other things, which in history has brought peace, the regional council has expressed the positive evaluation of the variant of the executive project of the fourth lot, phase 3, of the new unique garrison of the regional hospital Umberto Parini. With the approval of the variant of the executive project, we effectively close the third design phase that goes to achieve what in the imagination of every Aosta Valley is actually the new regional hospital. In fact, the fourth lot of the third phase provides for the realization of the bodies K, L and P, then respectively the helical cylinder - which I understand that someone shows off, but which in fact is the hospital for acute, with the conservation and enhancement of the archaeological finds -, the Hospital Street, therefore the body L, i.e. the new entrance of the new hospital that corresponds to the current Viale Geneva and the extension of the car underground, The approval of the variant of the executive project in advance times allows the issuance of the decree of the President of the Region as a qualification to build, which will therefore follow the start by SIV of the public tender procedure for the construction of the work for a total amount of charges and VAT of € 178,515,453.96, of these euros 143,94.169.18 are for work and correspond. 7-8 months, to the update of the amount of € 139,663,000, reported on the occasion of the commission last April and inserted in the documentation on which we actually tired; Then I understand that someone may think is such a written level at random, instead it was not. The variant of the definitive preliminary design, coming to history, that she rightly restarts since the spring of 2021 when a resolution was voted in this advice and, among other things, it was also devoted by many colleagues who today are not part of this majority, but that at the time both the majority and the minority believed and gave rise to a series of actions absolutely consistent on this theme ... the variant to the definitive design preliminary to the executive one Prepared during 2023, while the variant of the executive project - and this, connects Guichardaz, I already told him by responding to an initiative of his colleague Lucianaz a short time ago - was validated by the RUP on 8 July 2024, after being concluded what you rightly recalled, that is, the verification ratio by the verifiers who had arrived on July 5, 2024. From the SIV Single Member Assembly, on 15 October last, the variant of the executive design of the fourth lot of phase 3 of the new Parini hospital. The variant therefore to the executive project confirms consistency with respect to what was declared on the occasion of the hearing in the board commission of 10 April 2024, during which the main functional and performance characteristics of the building complex were illustrated, therefore the fourth lot regarding phase 3, therefore the bodies K, P and L, the cantierist aspects, the synthetic chronoprogram of the main Milestone of the intervention, which is just as Recalled, and I wanted to do it on purpose, they have undergone variations, but in fact we are now talking about something that ended on November 4, the costs of the intervention and the schedule in progress. We therefore close the process of phase 3 in accordance with the resolution of the Council of 12 May 2021 by her recalled which committed precisely to proceed with the variant of the executive project to adapt it to the safeguarding and enhancement of the archaeological finds through SIV, both compared to what was reported several times in this classroom in order to the theme of the new hospital. We therefore declined the provisions of the Council Resolution 1180/2021, proceeding with the preparation of the variant of the final and executive project of the intervention of phase 3. Once the new hospital for acute patients can therefore be carried out, the activities and functions carried out in the current Parini may therefore be transferred, thus freeing the current hospital and allowing to start the renovations of the subsequent stages. It is clearly evident of how the new hospital covered a central element in the overall reorganization of health reorganization, as expected in the planning of the regional Defr, in the plan of health and social well -being, in resolution 1609/2022 inherent in the new territorial planning and in the new corporate act. I understand that in the game of the parties the policy says that we move random, without a compass, but in reality these are acting politics and the administration reason for acts, these acts are consequential with each other and are fully consistent with each other. All these actions will therefore gradually reorganize health, the networks of social and health services, socio-assistance and social, making the models of taking care of the health and social well-being needs more effective of citizens and our Valley community. To date and up to the publication of the relative tender, as required by the contract code, it is not possible to spread further material since it is reserved documents that will form an integral part of the works of the works, as, among other things, we have declared, therefore the project is the one presented in the aforementioned session of the V Commission. This aspect is a non -secondary aspect, which, among other things, has very important technical connotations and which, in fact, also causes some of the things that have been requested could not be given. This motion, for which we therefore ask for the retreat otherwise we will abstain, has never been voted before, but less than it is today. In fact, the ideological positions may remain, different from a political and administrative point of view: this council has collected a vital practice for our community and for the part of our competence we have all abhorred the inertia that brought the closure of phase 3 at home in three and a half years. We are not over yet, there will be a race, a construction site, the subsequent phases to be analyzed and concluded, but to date we have behaved with common sense, seriousness, working hard and seriously, so in Maiora and certainly at the top of the hearts. The object of the dispute is that all the things that have been said in the presentation of this motion are part of a recent past: from today there is a future for which this majority hopes that everything goes in the best way in a world that varies, full of risks and pitfalls. Those who still want to talk about things must realize that with November 4th we moved on to another era and another phase."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Guichardaz,Erika,1976.0,F,PCP,8,3531,"I learned from the commissioner that Parini's expansion, then the hospital for acute, is the hospital, therefore a hospital made only by the acute side; All that is long -term care, rehabilitation, laboratory, clinics is as if it doesn't matter. I repeat and I repeat: that will be the hospital for acute, it is not the hospital that the Valley community needs, which is also made of all the other parts, because honestly, unless we think that from now on only acute patients exist, everything else must be, unless we delegate to private clinics, I believe that she has seen, for example, a broadcast of a few days ago on the very worrying of this Theme, but surely we will talk about it in the next advice, but, from this point of view, I ask her if, in her opinion, what she told us is an answer today, because the chronological terms, for example, compared to this project, after your answer I have not understood them, that is, it has given us times? He told us: ""The Aosta Valley community in 2030 will have the piece of the acute""? And I repeat: the piece of the acute, not the hospital, does not seem to me that she told us and, when we have the maternal childish put there, when we have psychiatry, what will those parking lots be? Of all this she has absolutely not given an answer and I repeat: none of us asks to have designs or things to disseminate outside, but we ask there is clarity, because she knows it better than me than having a radiology or two radiologies certainly has an impact not only for what concerns the operators that you tell us every day that they are not available, every time this thing is said, so we even split the radiologies. Radiologies, we will also need, I imagine, of machinery both on the one hand and on the other, that it does not seem to me to be also of little importance compared to the costs that we must imagine. Reading that resolution - however, as I say, I did not read it carefully because only today it was downloaded -, the same general manager, Dr. Uberti, at the same time clarifies his main interest in the solution of the residual interferences that may arise between the construction site in viale Geneva and west of this compared to the operation of the current hospital. The contents of a technical examination report that contains different points that, according to him, require in -depth analysis: for example, most likely, in an audition we will ask for access to the documents but having this relationship can certainly be of great interest, because the concerns of Dr. Uberti are concerns that we have reported from the first day and I am pleased that she continues to remember that the turning point has been in that 2021, because we are absolutely convened. Choice made in 2021 the more we go on, the more the right one is. Maybe in his replica he can also announce to the Aosta Valley when the piece of the hospital for acute is expected, in the motion there was also talk of having the knowledge of chronological terms not only of money, so we know, and we have read it everywhere, that we speak of 178 million for that piece, now we ask them: then it also tells us the chronological terms in which this piece will be done and I repeat: a piece, because then everything is missing. Thank you, of course we keep the motion and we will listen carefully to the other colleagues."
47900,XVI,06/11/2024,"ASSISTENZA SANITARIA E OSPEDALIERA, Presidio ospedaliero, EDILIZIA, Edilizia pubblica",en,Barmasse,Roberto Alessandro,1959.0,M,UV,10,4841,"I intervene from a technical-administrative procedural point of view, obviously the commissioner has already expressed himself. I only express my opinion, now the councilor Guichardaz at the beginning of his first intervention he always spoke saying: ""But we will not have a unique garrison"". I think the garrison will be unique, because there will be the hospital for Acuti and the part that remains in phases 4 and 5 will be the maternal childhood department and psychiatry. Once the project is completed in its completeness and complexity, we will have a single garrison. This is obviously good, but the other statement that she has made, councilor, is: ""All the health workers ask for the single garrison"", I worked many years in the hospital and nobody has ever asked me for anything. Perhaps Covid, however, has taught us, in the sense that it is to hit all the services in a single place - I repeat that I express a personal opinion - can perhaps create sometimes problems and perhaps a little something from Covid we should have learned it. There has also been talk of a double radiology, I think that a double radiology - I don't know if it is still expected - but it would certainly be very useful because we could separate the services for the degents and services for exteriors, this certainly could bring advantages from the point of view not to cross two paths that could create problems for patients. Which does not mean to have the same machinery in two radiology services with very high costs, but perhaps of the services and equipment that is a little more basic using staff according to needs. The hospital for acute for me is the hospital, because in the future ... but already now we should not include hospitals where patients remain hospitalized of the months, so much so that the hospital for acute, that I would not even call it for acute, but I would say the hospital, it is related - and this is also taken up in the plan for health and social well -being - to all health services in the area. So when the whole system is in operation, the hospital for acute will be a hospital in which people will have to stay as little time as possible, because we know very well that there are a whole series of hospitalization pathologies for which patients who do not need an intensive service is right that they are not in a hospital structure, but are in intermediate assistance facilities and maybe these structures is good for the territory for the discourse before On the fact of having a hospital in the city I think that each of us has its own opinions and they are all right and correct, there is no scientific publication in the world that say a hospital where it must be made inside a city or outside, these are subjective choices in relation to the needs also linked to logistics, the conformation of the territory, to the available spaces, to the occupation of green, therefore the methods and problems are multiple. I think it's difficult to say: ""I am 100% right and someone else is wrong"". There were some choices, as I said before, I know very well that she, councilor Guichardaz, does not approve of them, this said it several times, we would miss more, but to say that someone is right and someone is wrong I think it is very difficult. This government has made a choice, he is carrying out it, on one thing I perfectly agree with you, the hospital unit is an urgency and on this I would say that the health personnel is what he asks us, at least these are the questions that are asked to me, in the sense that people want them to leave the work for a hospital because they can no longer see this eternal excavation in front of the hospital that we have been thinking there for 15 years. Another little thing I wanted to say to the director Lucianaz, whom I saw that he has already booked again, is that she has reported a whole series of data and I congratulate her because she complains that she has no information, but she also manages to know the size of the parking lots. Before criticizing the absence of storage structures of materials or drugs, to have too small parking spaces where we should see how we can park cars, maybe first we acquire information, after which we will do the necessary criticisms. I think that the spaces also for further services in the old Parini structure are large spaces, where we can imagine a whole series of services to support Valley health and support to the hospital, this is my idea, but I think it should always be talked about perhaps with numbers and not only with assumptions. And if she managed to also have the size of the parking lots, tell me how she did, because I don't know."

Meanwhile there was someone who said a motion or an agenda is not denied to anyone, especially when this goes to a postponement in the commission, because it is in the commission that the real issues come out, they can be debated, they can be deepened. Of course, perhaps the demanding of the motion could be smooth, probably with a minimum of amendment we could say: ""Yes, Okay, we will go to the commission and we will do the insights"", which inevitably everyone asks, because I read just yesterday a commission report when there was the hearing of the SIV and the contract had to start in 2024, but in February, so there is evidently a delay and these delays will inevitably they will continue. Phase 3 has finally closed, also here with a significant delay, which is certainly attributable to what has been found, to the archaeological excavations, to all that has occurred and will have to start the 4 and 5 phases that complete the entire context of the hospital, from the hospital for acute to the hospital where there is the maternal childish and where there will be psychiatry. Here, however, we need to give time, we need to give answers, we asked in the past as a political force and also as a united center-right, we had strongly asked to understand times and resources that were necessary to complete the phases 4 and 5 Another reflection on the question of the single garrison: yes, they asked the commission, the medical unions asked here, they came here to say: ""We want the single garrison"". I remember that when I was councilor and I had tried to move the clinics by decentralizing them from the hospital, there was a popular uprising of the doctors: ""No, everything must be concentrated there"". So the things are like that. I believe that a minimum of amendment on this verification on technical-planning compatibility, which now no longer has reason to exist according to our point of view, but there is a need to have a general picture of the investments that will be necessary to get to the conclusion ... colleagues, please ..."

This asks for the opposition and this asks for the Valle d'Aosta community, because it is so, in every area, in every context, in every public apparition that we do these are the fundamental questions that are asked to us. Councilor, President, reviewing the demanding, we go to the commission and do the right insights, that it seems to me that it is something of a normality of a regional council that wants to go in the direction of building the future."

It is worrying the way you deal with this topic, your goodness, we will talk about it the next few months, above all the many Aosta Valley will talk about it that will be called to vote soon, even those of Aosta, common, and this will become a topic of sure public interest, as it has always been, but I would never have imagined such draconian answers on your part. Your goodness, continue like this. The delays are, I repeat, the executive project was from 2013 and the engineer Felli had planned to deliver the hospital for 2019. This is the story and look at what point we are. We will continue with this eternal construction site, with the disservices that many Aosta Valley know and above all those who work inside. To his colleague Barmasse I say: yes, the data, unfortunately I did not hear a single data in the councilor's response. I asked 27 questions, I also asked the 178 million what they were referring to, she rightly Glissa, continues like this, is her style, does not give answers, not only to the opposition, does not give answers to the Valley community. It is his way of behaving, he spoke for over ten minutes without giving a single answer to all the questions we asked them today. On the fact that in the old structure of Parini there are large spaces I ask the colleague Barmasse to accompany me, let's go to make a visit to understand what the large spaces are inside Parini, I only see that there are great critical issues. You don't want to talk about it anymore, on November 4th it seems that it is this definitive date, a pitcher date, for you it will be an important date, it will be the beginning of many big concerns for the Temo regional administration. He has not given us answers, he does not give us satisfaction, he does not want to talk about it, you talk about it to the newspapers and then we will have to do the job that an opposition advice does. It is a very little edifying way of dealing with the problem."

What I ask is to have answers and to have them in the commission, where we can confront each other. The same intervention of the former councilor Barmasse allows me to raise some of the critical issues that I have already reported in the introduction, the fact that even those who are mostly knows how to be structured, that is, the fact of having two radiologies or having one, however it affects the organizational model. We have just approved, and the commissioner Marzi, a corporate act, said it is normal - but we have also been told in the commission - that also compared to what the structure will be, to what human resources must be, to what the choice of the machinery will also be to be ... they will certainly be choices that somehow ... and we know it well because any building is designed and thought also with respect to the organizational model we want and compared to the services we want to give, This moment we do not know how many beds of the hospital for acute there are ... then I share, of course long -term care are a problem, but she also knows the data of the Valle d'Aosta healthcare, and knows how well how the patients are stopped within that hospital. We cannot say: when we do the hospital for acute, this will no longer exist, because then then you sincerely do it as soon as possible, because it means that they will not exist longer, it cannot be from this point of view. And also with respect to the definition of the spaces, there is ample literature that tells us how a modern hospital must be made, which must be within areas in some way not frequented by traffic, but this is quite evident, just pass there at six in the evening and ask yourself the problem of how ambulances - but we see it every time we pass - they must do to get to that hospital. Also from this point of view, if we want to inform us, there is ample literature that also tells us where hospitals must be put. What emerged also from today's debate, and surely the demanding is overcome, but sincerely we keep it anyway, since it seems to me that the will is so much that of not coming absolutely to the commission, whatever the demanding is not this will ... the questions we ask here, what underlined Dr. Uberti within that report attached to the resolution are all questions that naturally should be answered, at least within this classroom, at least we should be able to know. After that the choice is made, you carry it forward, because you are the majority and therefore you carry it forward, and I say it for this, but I think it has also been seen, for example, on other projects, which it absolutely did not agree, but, when the design started, of course it is not that one starts making battles or putting himself on the barricades, after which it will be time to tell us if the choice was right. Also on this, I will pass them, colleague Barmasse, because she was rightly not in the commission ... but, when the representatives of the doctors came, the only request was the unique garrison. This is the request they did to us, so this is what I feel like telling you because there is a document that has been filed in the documents of the Commission. Then rightly she says: ""When all the buildings will be done, this will happen"", who knows, I believe that neither I, nor my children we will see that unique garrison, but also on the times we sincerely have not yet understood even the times of the piece of the expansion, let alone if we were to ask for the times of everything else. From this point of view, I believe that today's debate also shows that somehow in the commission you have to compare yourself, and how!"

Well, the usual positions have always emerged, but there is some ideas and it is right that we take note of it and we also express our belief. We have always been convinced - and even more today with the times that are increasingly lengthening - of the fact that building a hospital there or, better, expanding it, making that place the fundamental center of the Valle d'Aosta health is a stupidism, it is madness. Some who plan hospitals and then, with little satisfaction, I must say, because it is never a satisfaction, to understand that those who governs you are doing nonsense, we have also recently read in an article in the local press, in the sense that a nice article has been made on a gentleman who is the engineer and designs hospitals, who is Aosta Valley. Of course, since Nemo propheta at home, as they say, went to design abroad and then designed the city of health in Piedmont. The journalist asks him: ""But how do modern hospitals do?"", ""Eh, modern hospitals are made where there is green, where there is space, where there is the possibility of making a modular hospital"", perfect, exactly the opposite of what we are doing. Beautiful, it was truly a great satisfaction, I say it with naturally irony, because we really understood that what we said, simply taking advantage of our common sense, was perfectly spot on. Making the hospital there, at the intersection of the two main streets of the Aosta Valley, that is Mont Blanc and the Gran San Bernardo, is gigantic nonsense, but by now you have decided, there has been nothing to do. The colleague Barmasse referred to Covid, who clearly did not teach us anything, because that was the project and that remained despite Covid and instead had the opportunity to make a different choice precisely using the motivation of the Covid and you did not do it, so it is clear that the will is that, who knows why I have my idea, but I do not express it here, but it has nothing to do with the functionality, with the functionality, with the use. Real reasons why Valley health should be designed in the future. I also hear about two radiologies, instead of one, thanks again that we can keep one open at this moment and I don't know how much, so we really say that everything that has been said and reiterated does not clearly make the two sides, but here on healthcare you should not do issues of political colors, you really have to do only common sense issues and to think that the health of the Aosta Valley is the priority, in my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, according to my convictions, education, but you really made the wrong choice. I therefore believe that even, let's say, the assessor inconside are out of place, those ad maiora, etc. I actually respond with another way of saying that the Latins had: that bad tempora currunt and then very often we forget the other piece, sed peiora Parantur. These are bad times, but, if we go on this way to govern like this, they prepare for it worse."

Functional hospital of the areas of hospitalization, notes on emergency management in the emergency area, first aid, intensive care, where, among other things, a double radiology was highlighted -one for the emergency room and one for everything as the body for acute -, the hospital headquarters of the first level DEA, the reception -certified -accepting functions, the emergency room functions in emergency and urgency regime, the therapy functions. Intensive, the functions of diagnostic radiology in urgency, notes on the characteristic functional types of the operating rooms, areas for the preoperative preparation, areas for the preparation of the intervention team, operating rooms area awakening, elipport surface, its characteristics of employment, Hospital Street and section of the Internato Parini Parking Park execution. This document of 31 pages - of course, connects Baccega, I am not saying it to her, I am saying it in favor of speech - it analyzed in a precise and precise way, as far as we are concerned and also as regards the SIV, the Department and the Usl company, the phase concerning the object of the resolution of Monday 4 April, so, regarding the fact that the government has absolutely shared the choices - and has done it in a preventive way, important to recall -, certainly during the year that will come there will be a whole series of aspects on which we will find ourselves confronting each other on this important passage that ended on November 4, 2024 and that it will now provide that the President of the Region decrees and that then, with the beginning of 2025, we go to the race. The object of the dispute is linked to a single aspect, on which, however, during the various debates and the various questions that have arrived on the executive of the new hospital, there is a vulnus, that is, the fact that from 10 April we then had the control of the external verifiers on 5 July 2024, a date referred to in my intervention during the general discussion of today, but also referred to during some of the initiatives that in the meantime came from validated by the RUP on July 8, 2024. This postponement from 10 April to July 2024, which then led SIV to approve to the board of directors on October 15, and therefore we to go to the council on November 4, is the only thing that moves from a temporal point of view the documentation that was distributed to all the colleagues of the councilors in April of this year. In my previous report, and this also I say it again for his colleague Lucianaz, the cost of the works, net of VAT and charges, which in this presentation was almost 140 million euros in this presentation, is also highlighted. The fact that afterwards went to 143 with VAT and the charges causes the 178 million of the resolution of 4 November 2024. In fact, everything that this initiative, which is absolutely out of the times - and, I repeat, nor because of the presenter, nor because of the undersigned -, in all respects, provided for in his demanding is not only now late compared to the fact that the junta has already approved the variant of the executive design. In the council, but also with respect to the fact that the whole part that is asked to share had already been shared in a preventive phase that at this point is about seven months earlier than the first leg of the executive design variant subject to this motion."

I remember that when I saw the first project hypothesis, I was in the city council in Aosta, he had arrived there with a huge papyrus and there was already that will to go in that direction. I hope I don't have the podestà tone that you have every now and then, but I know her, so I know she is like this, those who do not know her well in some way can also be annoyed. What I want to say is that we had a report by Dr. Galotto in the commission, who has explicitly explicit a series of paths in a fairly clear way I have to say and those paths must be re -explored in our opinion, because Dr. Galotto now I think it went in retirement and had an assignment precisely in the logic of following the works and the path of construction of the hospital for acute and also the phases 4 and 5 I believe, I do not remember the resolution that was adopted. Here is the need to have a comparison in the Commission, where it is easier to work, it is easier to learn more, it is easier to also ask questions that can also be only technicians for those who are not in that sector. We will therefore certainly vote for the measure because we believe that it is a duty, beyond this commitment which is a little too articulated, go to the commission and make a further study on the path that the new Parini hospital for Acuti in Aosta will create."

On the other hand, however, the debate has brought out - but the debate in the commission had already brought it out on April 10 - the need to be in the commission to discuss the things we have partially discussed today, but which certainly must be deepened, therefore, from this point of view, this closure continues from not wanting to come to the commission ... You spoke of the 31 -page document, I present 1: the one on the numbers of the hospital complex, there is a page to put this. Yes, of course, it is a page, and several times we have been told in the commission: ""No, but that ..."", ""the beds ... Ah, but you can find it in that schemino"". Yes, we are told how many beds there are, we are not told compared to the analysis made, we are not told anything, but it is absolutely good. ""If we don't want to deepen the themes, we rightly don't do it."" We have other tools, so do not worry, councilor, that the questions that we would have asked them in commission from here on we will do it in interpellations about interpellations, this is what we can do, therefore access to the documents and constantly interpellating to be able to understand better where you are going, because, I repeat, you are going to you. I hope you are not going against a wall, not so much for what concerns your choices, but precisely for the Aosta Valley population. Councilor, I really invite you to listen to what emerged in a short interview of a pensioner a few days ago on La7, because we will talk about that and it is certainly something that we have been denouncing for some time within this regional council that worries us very much, because then it is precisely the fragile people like that pensioner who must contact private health and even to contract the price of a simple intervention, therefore most likely also on this theme, They took place in the Aosta Valley and the Aosta Valley was recognized, because, from the point of view of health, in some way we had the same treatment both for those who were in one condition and for all the others. Unfortunately, what we are recording is no longer this and we are recording that for some time there have been the most fragile people who have difficulty having answers with respect to treatments that are not of who knows what relevance, but that of course they make a person's quality of life can change."

I do not enter the discussion, perhaps we did it three years ago by supporting the accompaniment of this path. I do it very short: I think the final data of the discussion can be summarized in five very fast points. The fact that in a few months the expansion of the new hospital will compete, the fact that in a few weeks the president of the Region will approve the decree, the decree will sign ... it is from the day before yesterday that the regional government has positively evaluated the project and is a few weeks ago that the SIV assembly has spent at the assembly what is the executive, colleague, and that a few weeks ago the RUP validated the whole. To return to the initial reasoning, the verification of the external subjects was made in July 2024 and the document that was illustrated for several hours in the commission is practically the same that was approved by the regional council two days ago. This is to say that it seems to me that the commissioner has highlighted not only the path, but the mandatory technical passages that have been made in these 5-6 months and that the novelty of today is that the government has positively evaluated the project and that in the coming weeks there will be the decree to go in the coming months. I think we are not all technicians, we are not all engineers, we are not doctors, we have another role, I think that the synthesis of the debate ... Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to highlight what has been done in these six months anyway."

The hospital topic is a topic that I believe has been widely addressed both in this classroom and in the debate of our community. Here to my right we have the world champions of the referendum and it seems to me that there has been a consultation that had a very close, very important debate and I think the answer was quite clear. The answer was given by the community that has widely deserted a consultation, among other things, many of those who went to vote have also somehow expressed an opinion contrary to the will of the proposers of the referendum. Now a whole series of initiatives, I say it, I don't know if I interpret badly, but they are basically to delay and block the works, and then say: ""See, here you don't go on"", that is, a whole series of initiatives are initiatives, in my opinion, pretext: that's why I believe that the exhortation that comes from these benches to the government is to proceed, it is to let the technicians speak, envy towards some colleague who seems to me to have skills that are above average, they are engineers, they are architects, they are security experts, so it would seem that the designers, the technicians who have been identified are at least of the unwary, of unreliable people, while here in the regional council we have excellent minds. So, since I try to stay with the things that a person of common sense highlights, the commissioner Marzi and the government is urged to proceed as they are doing, in a tight way to be able to give as soon as possible a new hospital to the Aosta Valley, because, if we are feeling this committee of the No, we continue to have chress, because we do not know where the new hospital wants to be done, it is not known with what money, but you are not known, Then go on with common sense, correctly and try to proceed with the work."

I make a small importance on the things I heard, it has been said that the Valle d'Aosta population expressed itself back in 2007 or, better, that it did not express itself because it did not go to vote. I believe that all those who are here, maybe the youngest no, but the others surely yes, they will remember that that was the referendum of the ""broken pencils"", I think you will remember it; It was made, by the main party that at that moment was at levels other than the current ones in the Aosta Valley, a campaign was made to ask the people not to go to vote: Pas de sens pas de vote. The people who went to the polls instead responded clearly, in a clear way, and here there are also people who sit on the government counter and who had dedicated a lot of energy to that referendum, then in the meantime they have changed their mind and this is another story, but I would like to point out that from 2007 they have passed 17 years and in the middle there has been everything and more. The health situation has been extremely changed, there are problems that are linked to a request for better health care, and they are no small things, there has been a pandemic that should have requested, it should have caused reflections, it should have asked for a moment and to make comparative evaluations, because, if you remember well, when we have chosen not to follow the path of the Parini hospital to be redone, we have really asked myself if it is really easy to ask. Forget things, it is better, or if there is a collective memory deficit ...! Because we asked that a comparison was made to understand which choice, given that since then, everything has happened to come to 2021, that comparison that could tell us: ""It is better to use the money in that way, it is better to make a hospital outside, it is better to leave it there"", that comparison did not want to do it, we didn't want to! Because we did not say, when we voted against that famous resolution that led to the resignation of both - because it was logical that, if such a thing was not supported, it was out of a majority, it seems obvious to me ... - We did not say: ""No, let's do the new hospital"". No, gentlemen, we didn't say that, we said another thing, and it is not a waste of time to deepen, especially after everything that happened. Please, therefore, we leave the 2007 referendum in peace, because you know very well who was the responsibility for the failure of that referendum and I believe that, if after 17 years another thing had done, we would have had surprises, because the people in the meantime perhaps also matured and what happened has left in all people - and they are all that they need health interventions - perhaps different from those who were previously there. You did not want to do the comparative study, you decided to go on, this is the road, but, please, you cannot say that asking to do an in -depth analysis, an audition with all the documentation that is requested in the appropriate commission of this advice is a way to slow down the operations. But what slowing down? You ask to see what is there, you ask to take stock, but are we kidding? What do you want to slow down? We ask to see, then we know the positions that our positions are different, and I speak of our positions, mine and of the colleague Guichardaz - they were very clear from the beginning, we have not walked on and we did not vote first in one way and then in the other.

Personally, as regards me, if there is a referendum, even if a person goes to vote, that is, he decides, rightly, because he is the only one who takes charge of a civic duty and, if it votes like this, the others will have to suffer the decision. We remember, by memory of everyone, who voted for about 30% that referendum and this 30% abundantly above 60, I went to see it: 63.56% had said that the new hospital wanted, so somewhere else, just for correctness.

Just last week, the dossier on immigration to Valle d'Aosta was presented, a document that highlights very significant data on the presence of migrants in our region and their difficulties of access to basic services. The dossier also underlines how essential it is to guarantee this effective integration and structured support to avoid marginalization and vulnerability between migrant people. In light also of these data, it is clear how important it is to reactivate the service that is the subject of this motion, because this counter has the task of offering assistance and orientation to those who live in already precarious conditions, it becomes an indispensable tool for promoting social cohesion and facilitating a real inclusion. Also in the Defr, the importance of the inclusion of the inclusion was outlined in the strategic objectives and priorities of intervention, but we return to the path of this motion, which originates on November 2, 2023, then there was a new initiative in May 2024, precisely to understand from the government what was happening with respect to this service and had been declared that precisely in the budget 600 thousand euros had been allocated with a provision of 200 thousand euros and the service would have been the service. Reactivated shortly thanks to regional resources to give continuity. We understand that this continuity is not there, therefore in the motion we ask that the commissioner clarifies the times and intentions with respect to the activation of this race, assuming that perhaps we have not seen it and instead has already been published. We ask the commissioner again to have answers because that continuity, taking into account that the service has been interrupted since December 2023, I would say that it was not there."

To meet the needs of colleagues also expressed with respect to the timing, I will say some short things by announceing that the Lega Group will vote contrary to this motion and will not vote contrary to the question of the hearing in the commission, which, as we know, is the cigarette of a condemned to death: it never refuses, nobody refuses, so it is not a big commitment. What our opposition finds in general is precisely the principle and the spirit that unfortunately this service has and is something that we have also reiterated on several occasions, because this service that we want to support and finance with flower of public money is a counter that offers services that are actually already there and there are for everyone, that is, today the services that this counter provides, should provide today are already provided to all Valley citizens who go to any type of shop. Specifically, the ""Live Valle d'Aosta"" service is offered the orientation and accompaniment service to territorial services and support for social and residential insertion. There are already social branches, there are already a series of services that are evidently provided for all citizens and, precisely because there are a series of appeals and actions, I remember one above all the association financed by our friend Soros, the ASGI Association, which obviously takes care of only defending the rights of immigrants, at any foot, every time there is a public call, a law or something, if there is something that also excludes someone who has landed tomorrow and Those who in this region or in its municipality has been born and lived there for a lifetime, then the Asgi intervenes to ask for equality of rights, but the equality of rights that is asked on one side you do not want to get on the other, because here you want a specific desk that supports only immigrants for accompanying, territorial services and support for social housing insertion. Not only that, consultancy and orientation in school, with support for enrollment, where necessary, training and work, support for the compilation of telematic practices relating to citizenship requests. I mean ... but there are the offices that already do it, if I go to the Municipality counter, if I go to the police station counter, if I go to any type of counter that today is available to everyone, I find the same service. We are not sincerely understood why we should activate and finance a service specifically and exclusively only for immigrants. Obviously, compared to this spirit, honestly we do not find ourselves sharing the need to build, structure and implement this service, therefore evidently we will vote contrary."

We are talking about structure a counter with a dedicated headquarters and with larger functions than the ""Vivere in Valle d'Aosta"" desk which provided only an important but discontinuous and lacking presence compared to the opening to the public. We are therefore working with a wider vision, aimed at connoting the new immigration desk with a more solid structure and with more activities than in the past, in order to finally guarantee a continuous and qualified presence of the service in the area. In addition to the realization, among other things, of this counter, the offices worked on three family projects - that is, fund, asylum, migration and integration -, deposited between 23 and 24, which represent an added value and specialized in the commitment aimed at improving the access and quality of services. Fami projects focus on three crucial areas: the strengthening of the teaching of the language to facilitate linguistic integration, which is a project already started; The development of an advanced data management system through a computerized database, which allows those who access the services to obtain personalized and targeted support, which is a project during the start and the strengthening of training courses and recognition ..."

The ambitious goal, to which all these interventions contribute, is to create an immigration counter that does not limit its functions to a mere point of assistance, but can represent a real model of inclusion and innovation capable of responding complete and professionally to the needs of new arrivals and residents. To this end, the competent structure has been working since last month of March in identifying a strategic and suitable space that it can be allocated to the counter. The goal is to find an adequate location that can respond to needs as a point of reference for citizenship. In this sense, the offices are examining several options of spaces to be found both in the public and in the private individual, but to date they are not easily viable. The offices are therefore continuing to explore other possible solutions, taking into account that the search for an adequate venue for this destination is not easy, as they are characterized by processes that require complex assessments and procedures not of immediate solution. For this reason, given that the goal therefore remains to continue working to find a solution that in 2025 allows the opening of the counter by identifying the solution to outsource the service completion, it is a solution that ensures the finding of the location as a future complete outsourcing implies that the manager, in addition to taking the service, identifies the seat of the same at the same time. The tender specifications, among other things, in this sense, is being completed in such a way as to start the service at the beginning of 2025. With the outsourcing of the service, we have therefore imagined a new model that guarantees efficiency, accessibility and continuity, entrusting the management to a specialized economic operator. This choice will allow us to build a structured, welcoming and proactive service, capable of dealing with current challenges in a timely and professional way, through a more agile and flexible service unlike the past in which the limited resources reduced its effectiveness. The selected manager will also have the task of providing complete and personalized assistance to anyone who turns to the counter, therefore dealing not only to orient the new residents and migrants in bureaucratic issues, but also to promote the integration and knowledge of the territory, facilitating their insertion in the Valle d'Aosta community. This means support in housing research, assistance in understanding and charms of administrative practices, as well as a working orientation by territorial, social and health services. Ultimately, this choice to outsource not only accelerates the opening of the service, but enhances its effectiveness, transforming ""living in Valle d'Aosta"" into the most functional immigration desk as a model that will bring tangible benefits to the whole community. What is just expressed therefore makes it evident that the demanding of this motion is overcome in facts and concepts and, for this reason, we ask for the withdrawal or we will abstain."

47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,14755,"Let's go back to the topic of the management of the kennel and cattle. I state that this morning, about the debated question on the hospital, the commissioner Marzi had the opportunity to affirm that they, as a government, do not proceed random, as they say today, a little so attempted, and that they are consistent in their action. I fear, councilor, today, that I will have to deny it with the documents in the hand of this topic, of the management of the kennel and cattle; A question that we had already raised in unsuspected times, because it was spring and asked for news, through an interpellation, of the government's will to face the question of the management of the kennel and cattle, knowing that at the end of this year the existing convention would have expired with an animal rights association, the one currently in place. Well, the answer was not given to us by the commissioner, who at the time for health problems unfortunately was not present, but by President Testalin, who told us that the offices were evaluating what to do. Then, in the summer, we understood what was the result of this assessment on what to do, because the regional council, with resolution 952 of 12 August 2024, which bears as the title ""approval of the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the regional administration for the three-year period 2024-2026, approved with DGR 276/2024, with the management of the kennel and regional cat"" will, of what was the technical-administrative, but also political, to go. Then we had other initiatives, precisely after the summer, after this resolution of the Council, in which we were explicitly explicit that it had been decided to no longer entrust this service to animal rights associations, but to proceed with a tender, pursuant to the contract code, and then this fact was further explicit. Of course, this motion has started which has been postponed several times, as we know, for various reasons, and then also in the Defr it was explicit by the government, this will to proceed not with direct assignment as it had been done previously, but through a race, was explicit. The answer in this regard, which also came from the commissioner, was that of the fact that ""it must be done so"", ""is better like this"", ""is more transparent"", the concept of rotation is, etc. In reality it is not so at all. This is not the case, as we will try to show you, the documents in hand, today. And even a great contradiction in the action of the current government emerges. Then, the assignment of the management service of the kennel and regional cattle is expiring precisely at 31 December of this year. There is a government press release that announced the intention to proceed with tender pursuant to the Code of Public Contracts for the assignment of this service for the future three years, that is 2025-2027, and precisely, given the resolution 952 that I have just mentioned, with which we proceed to the integration of the program of purchases of goods and services of the regional administration for the three-year period 2024-2026 with an allocation, Euro, therefore they are not even negligible sums, and considering that this motivation, this resolution, had already objected to this fact a little, hot, at the time of the last intervention of the ... I think it was September, let's say that this deliberates at a certain point like this, as ugly, as they say today, says: ""Considering that the competent offices of the prevention structure, public health, veterinary and food safety have been, for the next three -year period, service in question pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/23, i.e. the contract code; CONSIDERED - He continues - therefore necessary for the reasons represented above ... "". Here, there are no reasons, that is, having evaluated it does not mean that it is a motivation, in terms of administrative law, it is a classic non -existent motivation or, if we want, sometimes some judge calls it apparent. There is a fake motivation, because you cannot tell me that you have evaluated and therefore you do this; you have to say what you have assessed. Relevant if we put this resolution and another resolution of this same government in a watermark, that of 6 December 2021, where instead the agreement between the Region and the Association that currently manages was approved; Also because this resolution tells us many things: he tells us, first of all, for example, that clearly the rule foresees it, but we call it back so much by memory of everyone, that is, we recall ourselves, as they say, but also because I think many of you will not be very interested in this topic, but the management service, in fact, of kennels and cats can be entrusted to zoophilic, animal rights and protectionist bodies and associations; Moreover, we will see later, even the rules or circulars of the Ministry, primarily, say ... there is the law, precisely the 281 that says it, then says this, I am quoting the passages of this resolution of this same government of 2021: ""Considering that pursuant to article 24, paragraph four, of the regional law 30/07/2010 - our law on animals of affection - the activity carried out in the context of the conventions. of the expenses actually incurred for the non -health management of the kennel "", therefore by non -sanitary aspect only reimbursement of expenses eh, because there is a health part, a non -health part in the management of these bodies, of these kennels and cats. ""Therefore considered - he continues, cuts some parts - on the basis of these considerations, that the management of the kennel and cattle - attention, this is the key step, one of the key passages - by the regional administration should not be entrusted to be taken into account only of the costs, but also of the well -being of the animals, included not only their living conditions in the structures that host them, but all the various activities aimed at their assignment and related control, respect"". Here, this is the fundamental aspect, because the laws that govern this matter, all the administrative measures that govern these subjects, are marked not to a simple matter of costs, of evaluations, as is done to sell goods or entrust services, is not this; Animals of affection are something else, they are animals, in fact, and must be treated differently from any product. And then he still says this resolution, always a very interesting part: ""Recalized the circular of the Ministry of Health, which on May 14, 2005, number 5, of implementation of Law 281 of 91 - precisely the national one on the animals of affection - which provides that the conventions for the management of kennels and cats must be granted priority to associations or entities having the protection of animals"". And then he continues, I explain it again, still acknowledging a question that is important for the purpose of our discussion, of our discussion, that is, it says again, this resolution, an equally sacrosanct thing: ""Taking note that, pursuant to article 8, paragraph 7, of the regional law 16/2005 - that on voluntary associations except - voluntary organizations cannot participate in the public evidence procedure relating to the assignment of public contracts, supplies "". Here, then, here we close the circle: on the one hand the rules on the matter tell us that when we deal with this matter we must not only look at the appearance and the income statement and, therefore, things that can clearly be identified in a contract, it becomes difficult to identify in a contract as well as you love animals, this is a little difficult, I believe, that you can codify. So, here, putting together all these pieces, we come to the fact that we absolutely consider: that by choosing this path to make a race, evidently we necessarily exclude voluntary associations, which instead are the ones that have been dealt with by it, and very well I would say, also because (and here another contradiction arises) then that resolution, which we have mentioned 2021, what does it still say about those who are still managing? In the spirit of giving continuity to the management, pursuing the priority objectives of protecting animal welfare and spread of the correct human-animal relationship, he reported the need to review some points of the current convention. ""Considering that the Valdôtaine Association etc. etc. managed the regional kennel and cattle from the eighty -nine to today, thus gaining a considerable experience in this area; given that the competent veterinary public health hygiene structure has analyzed the positive trend of the management of the kennel and regional cattle entrusted to the A.VA.A Onlus etc., in the last two years of management from which the average number of animals is highlighted, adoptions of the specimens returned to the owners "". So this is the non -health part, and there is the whole table with the numbers: how many animals entered, how many animals have been entrusted, to those who found a place, given by adoption, etc. saying ""Ah, these have done well, they are doing well"". Now we wonder why the government has completely changed its way without saying why. Here the critical issues were born, because if you don't tell me why two years ago everything went very well, it was managed well, the service had to be marked by issues that are not only economic, technical, etc., but precisely to what are the correct principles, I would say, that they are more than shared, that is, to treat animals well, to love animals, to also do the activity that is further and not paid, obviously, to try to place the animals. they need, the puppies etc., who need to find a family; Now, however, you move on to a commercial criterion, you make the race and why do you make the race? Do you think there is some companies, some s.r.l. Or any cooperative, perhaps, that can do better? Not of volunteers, however, eh, of people who do it to earn, more or less, or maybe even to undergo those who then make work. This is a problem, so there is something that doesn't work. There are various problems in this decision, there are technical-administrative, legal problems, because we have seen that, in doing so, we go against principles that are still sanctioned by the norm, that of offering the priority to animalistic associations and, moreover, I open a parenthesis, we have also been confirmed by the councilor in his latest intervention of the month of September, which told us that there was only one, now there are three; They are three better, there is more competition, there will be the possibility to choose who to entrust it to, right? Even ... if by chance they say all three are not there, then we will have to choose another way, but in reality the norm also says that the management of kennels and cats should be directed, that is, made by the municipalities; Here we do it at the regional level, but from the municipalities, therefore by the public body and alternatively, therefore, then in the second instance, entrust to other subjects, primarily to voluntary associations. Here we are instead at the third solution: we make a tender as if it were any service, as if it were to build the dog's kennel, it is not this ... the kennel and cattle is not that, it is something else than much more important and much more fully. So this is the technical-legal aspect, then there is that of the merit: in fact, we have seen and I have listed you now what the contradiction is, on the one hand in saying two years ago okay, it is well managed like this, there is the healthcare part, but there is the non-health part that it exists and which, among other things, provides for the refund only of the costs and, now, without telling me why, you change, you change the way, here. And then there is clearly a political evaluation. Because this choice is evidently a political choice, of the two each, I believe I regarding this political topic: o, dear councilor, you are making you bring someone else to the arms - it is inevitable to think this, since you have not motivated - or, I don't know, someone has already thought of some cooperative; I don't know this, but you understand that it comes to think badly when there are many elements put together. Many clues make a test and therefore this scares me a lot. We therefore believe that, despite what you have said and written, despite what you have also sanctioned on the Defr, perhaps it would be very appropriate to redo a reflection on this decision - which I think completely inappropriate - to proceed with a tender instead of referring, as always, to those who have done well; That I do not say that they are the ones who are already there now, anyone else, but an association of animal rights activists who do it with a vision, with purposes other than those purely profit. Then, the motion (I read the demanding, then reserving naturally to intervene in the continuation): ""The regional council commits the regional government to revoke, also in self -protection, the decision to proceed pursuant to Legislative Decree 36/2023 to reach identification - I say in self -protection because in my opinion it is also illegitimate from an administrative point of view, however - to reach the identification of the regional, excluding voluntary organizations from the possibility of becoming a foster of this management; proceed with the identification of the subject to whom to entrust the management of the regional kennel and cattle, in compliance with the priority criterion provided for by the circular of the Minister of Health on May 4, 2000, number 5, implementing Law 281 of 91 and only in the alternative, in the absence of voluntary associations concerned, proceeding pursuant to the legislative decree 36/2023 "". Clear, it is evident, if you do not want to do it then directly, if those who were prioritously questioned ""to us"" does not care "", then you should act directly, if you do not want to do it directly, you should then resort to anchor; But that should be, as I said before, the last residual choice: first the volunteers."
47902,XVI,06/11/2024,"SANITÀ VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA, Sanità veterinaria",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,6944,"Dear colleague Sammaritani, colleague councilor, not a lawyer, because I can not be a lawyer, I do not have the titles, the skills, the skills; However, as you often recall, here we are doing politics, so I am absolutely certain that, beyond the foil, saber, punching, punching, decide on current regulations, we are absolutely sure that both she and the classroom can only share the most appropriate orientation that identifies the most suitable administrative path in an open race to guarantee in continuity the continuation of the service. It is obliged to refrain on this initiative, above all because, as already highlighted, compared to a situation that today sees at least three animalistic associations on the regional territory, and no longer a single association, as referred to in the 2021 resolution that she recalls, and therefore it must be considered, in addition to the fact that there are three animalistic associations, also the significant economic entity of remuneration of the service, equal to 1.5 million euros, 500,000 euros per year, widely higher, this figure, compared to the direct assignment thresholds to the services today determined in 140,000 euros, but this knows this better than me. Instead, it is not understood why and how the rumor for which the volunteer associations cannot participate in the tender, as recalled; In reality, the same can participate, as required by article 100 of decree 36 of 2023, which provides for this possibility for subjects who have already had experiences, with a positive outcome, with public or private entities, as well as voluntary associations are also. We therefore confirm what has already been reported on the intention of this administration to call a European tender, with an open procedure for a single lot for the assignment of the management of the kennel and regional cattle; Also because this is the only way that can be traveled for an administration that wants to survive and do the correct thing for the community on this issue. The procedure will therefore be carried out by virtue of the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, naturally pursuant to the contract code, therefore assessed on the basis of the best quality/price ratio, compared to the cost proposed for the management of the service, which will surely examine the proven previous experience in the management of public kennels and cats. In open procedures, voluntary associations are also considered economic operators, authorized by the system to provide services and carry out economic activities; Therefore, the same are part of the list of subjects to whom public contracts can be entrusted, as provided for in European law. In line with the aim of guaranteeing the highest quality of the service, the regional administration will not proceed with the award if no offer is convenient or suitable for the service subject to the contract, in the full interest of the well -being of dogs and cats hosted within the kennel and regional catile. It should also be noted that the priority criterion foreseen by the circular of the Ministry of Health she recalled will certainly be respected in the tender notice; This criterion, if the management is entrusted to a subject different by an animal rights association that is not able to guarantee animals with its own internal resources an appropriate physical and socialization activity, as required by current regulations, establishes, in the guarantee principle, the entry within the kennels to animalist associations. This comparison perhaps also allows us to explain that the European standard exceeds national law, allowing everyone to participate in public tenders; It therefore also exceeds the regional law 16 of 2005 (discipline of volunteering and associations of social promotion) which, in article 8, provides that organizations cannot participate in public evidence procedures relating to the assignments of public contracts of works, services and supply. National legislation, especially the European one of contracts, has in fact legislated differently; It is possible that the associations involved have taken this regional law as the only reference, thus feeling excluded, but so it is and never wanted to be. Instead, what has always wanted to do is distinguish the role of manager of a space and public money from the role of voluntary organization, to protect the service rendered, the animals involved and also of the organizations, in fact, animal rights activists. Connect Sammaritani, of course I also said that we will ask to withdraw the initiative otherwise we will abstain; In my opinion, it is absolutely important to grasp a distinction on this issue, because, in addition to administrative aspects, which are used to deal with the theme, behind all this there are more than legitimate but purely motivations of a political nature; Those who are involved pro tempore in the management of this department, but also in the task of having to interact with the subjects who manage it, is perfectly aware that behind this world there is a world that, as if to say, moves, grinned, looking for contacts, confirmations, which at the moment should be absolutely serene. So we, as a government, not only do we represent the fact that the choice that was made with acts is correct, is a transparent choice and is the only one possible, because you understand well that there are absolutely legitimate reasons that led to the then act of 2021. Motivations that have been fundamentally incardinated on the presence in this region of a single voluntary association: choice more than legitimate; To date, this is no longer allowed. Among other things, a figure of this kind does not need a poor fassacchiotto, chubby and peeled like myself, to represent it to a lawyer; It is also linked then after the figure that in all respects, how to say, someone ... can I make a car body shaming? I heard, it's called self -irony in Italian. However, objectively speaking, this thing here also allows you to do an intervention on the figure, because the figure is an important thing, as well as in the presence of multiple animalistic associations. The fact then after that it was decided with a resolution to give a mandate to the unique control unit of client to insert the performance of this tender within the services was also represented by the CUC as the absolutely more normal way. As already represented by a group colleague of his yesterday, it is not of this government to give indications beyond one's autonomy and autonomy of others, and therefore, consequently, it is not even of this government to ensure that someone harpsings ours."

Returning to the topic, I must say that there are gaps in the reasoning that she, or in any case for her, did, because actually we have never been told what had to be the prerequisite. That is, we say: this is the right path, we do not say why the other is wrong, the one you have pursued until two years ago is wrong and that it would no longer be prosecuted, because in fact it is still persecutable, so it is an essentially political choice, evidently. This, okay, is there, it is you in the government, you can do what you believe in this profile, but the contradiction of the arguments - or rather, of the arguments on the one hand and nothing on the other - that emerges precisely ICTU Oculi, that is, immediately. From there there is a speech: let's do this because there are these constraints, there is the possibility of entrusting directly, there are these possibilities, they did well ... Then, as I say, I have nothing to do with this association and it is not said that it should be her, but I speak of the associations in general because they are straight from principles other than those of trade or purely economic ones. All these reasons on one side and on the other the nothing. Then, in putting all the reasons and nothing on the scale, it understands that it is strange to understand why and why to accept this obvious contradiction. This is the true theme. The figure is important now, it was even before, because it is not that we are the result from that, as more cosine in this commitment of these sums (we said 500 thousand per year), but even before we were more or less there, therefore over 400 thousand abundant, so it is not even the motivation. The problem is that you are trying to support, with non -existent motivations, a purely political choice. So that you say it, that you say that volunteers associations ... that then we hope that they go to do it what they have to do, because that's the problem: you are burning, because now you will give it to a society or a cooperative that does things because it has a certain return, because the most economically advantageous offer is that, and then hoped, as it is already written also in the rules, that the volunteers have already made that part, And they go to do clearly free, etc. Who knows if they go to do it? What if they don't go to do it? I mean, these of the cooperatives or this s.r.l. (let's call it s.r.l.), who goes there because he is paid to do certain things, do you think he slams day and night to look for a house for a cat? But when ever? But where do you live? But what have you seen? This is the theme, so you are burning yourself. A sector that is already delicate, a kennel and cattle that already as structures is not worthy of a reality like ours, which, however, all in all, is limited and should have much more decent spaces for these poor animals and much more suitable, because I do not know who went to see, but I would invite you to go and take a look at where they are kept, with so much love I must say from those who work there, but certainly with the same tools. I repeat, the concept is here you must not go and watch the tenders, these purely cheap considerations should not be made: animals are not a product, I have already said, they are not a service, they are much more. Their management requires an appearance that cannot be quantified, you cannot put yourself to the table, you cannot reduce to a tender where you say ""you have to do this, this and this and everything you do Vale Tot and I give you"" because it is not so, that's why the rules are oriented in that way. There will be a reason: either the legislator is one who does not think or has made them for one reason and the reason is that. Therefore, to conclude, without making too much the sentimental, but these topics interest me because I keep the animals and therefore annoy me when someone bureaucratizes this sector too and it should not be so, it should not be healthy, let alone the animals that they can not even defend themselves. Gandhi said so, that the civilization of a people is measured by the way in which animals treats. Here, if this is, you are probably not very civil."

To date it is not so. Among other things, I have been calling on this, because she is an auditor, as well as a technician and a professional, in all the answers I have given; I recalled it directly because I was absolutely certain that she had caught this aspect, I am absolutely certain that she also caught it by reading the resolution of 2021, just as we took it at the time and we took it in the continuation. I also add the fact that, in full legitimacy, we not only keep to the well -being of animals, including dogs and cats, especially dogs hospitalized in the kennel and regional cats, because as you know, the cats in all respects are of the mayor: we had a dedicated meeting in this sense to Celva on which we renewed the documentation on the Celva website itself and we had a moment of strong sharing with the offices compared to the future and present. Fact, of municipal relevance, therefore it is also useful that in this sense it can be correctly represented that the hospitalization of the poor cats at the kennels is not allowed by the law for the well -being of the animals themselves. We keep both dogs and cats, and in this sense the sensitivity that she recalls is absolutely married. I add, however, that it might seem a paradox not only political but above all administrative, the fact that on a tender with multiple subjects, which could win it for figures to the extent of 500 thousand euros per year, you are asking a government or any administrator not to make a public evidence tender, but I know that this is absolutely not in its intent."

Speaking of the presence of more than an association, I believe that this can only enrich the landscape, in the sense that it is true that an administrator says: of course, I have only one, so I work my hands, to that do (if he wants it) and ends there, but this is not the problem I think that outside the Aosta Valley, where I have to imagine that there has never been a single volunteer association, the kennels of others are also managed by volunteers. parts, so much so that there is an appeal to the TAR, of which I had read a sentence long ago, where there was talk of this: an association that had challenged because the entity, the Municipality in this case, since it was municipal, had decided to put together various municipalities, to consort with other municipalities, and manage it directly. There the association said: ""Eh no, you have to give it to us because it is written 'priority'"". It was not evidently corrected, so much so that the TAR rejected that appeal, but it makes us understand that the voluntary associations are also outside, they manage the kennels and cats and clearly they are not only one for metropolitan areas, perhaps Lombard or Piedmontese; Here in Valle d'Aosta there was this situation. There are three of them, I told you before, call them all three, if all three will tell us no, you will do what you want to do; If, on the other hand, one tells us so, the dates to that and otherwise they will decide, maybe they will also consort among them, what is the problem? The problem is precisely the merit of the question. Volunteering is a plus in this case, for this reason it is necessary to favor them. It is not a favoritism of any kind, it is precisely to do good for animals. Allow that these services - which are partially economical, economically quantifiable, etc., and in part instead arise from love for animals, which cannot be replaced with any payment - can be coordinated. This is the theme and this is the vision that it should have, in my opinion, a politician in this sector. Then you have differently, patience. Of course, we do not withdraw the motion."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8794,"This motion follows an inspection initiative that we had discussed some advice ago and which highlights a problem that we then spoke later, that is, the question of the increases. A question of the increases regarding public residential housing which, substantially, stems from a modification and a different assessment that has been calculated by the ominous, therefore an improvement of what is the structure, of the neighborhood, of the residential area in which some housing of the public republic building are inserted, which has started a series of increases that have been considered unjustified and also to a problem relating to the issue of the heating, ARER did a part of it, also doing also psychological terrorism, saying that the fuel was about to run out and therefore it was necessary to save it. Net of this, the theme of this motion is precisely the question of the rent and I will try to summarize it in a few lines. What is the question? The question arises from this: if we take a payment method ... let's talk about the free market, on the free market anyone can contact the home owner and ask: ""How much do you want to rent?"" And the home owner says to you: ""I want x"". If it is fine to me and I have the substances necessary to be able to pay well, if I don't have them, obviously I refuse. In the public residential construction sector, however, it works in a different way, because I ask a question, I enter the ranking, based on what is a series of calculations, the figure I have to pay is developed and, once I am inside, if this figure is increased to me I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of not being able to cope with you. Trivially, I have already done this example other times, but I think it is particularly evocative: if I am a person with disabilities, who takes an accompanying pension of about 380 euros per month and what you want can happen, the eternal father can also come down but I always 380 euros per month I receive, I will not be able to pay a rent of 390 euros, but not even 381, because I enter 380. Considering that I don't eat, he doesn't drink, he doesn't move, don't breathe, don't watch television, don't warm me up and so on, it is clear that I can't pay more than 380 euros. Today, however, unfortunately many public residential housing are actually subjected to this ""blackmail"", because it happens that the people who live there are increasing the rent, you can see the expenses increase. I have made examples, I always have another of the many bills that have arrived, of € 909.90 for a popular house (one month of rent, only for rent, are 909 euros). It is clear that if I have an income that clearly cannot change, if I am an elderly person, but also only if I have a job that does not allow me to earn figures of this type, it is clear that I will not be able to cope with you. So what is the means that has been used by other regions to prevent this cost from coming? Because the problem is that we have a regional law that rightly has one of his article, which is 42, which governs the forfeiture of the assignment. The forfeiture of the assignment is indicated - one returns in the case of the forfeiture - when there are no four bills, therefore four unpaid rents. After four unpaid rents, the eviction procedure begins. It is clear that if I have a rent to pay for 381 euros and I receive 380, as I said before, making it account that I do not eat, it did not drink and do not do anything else but I limit myself to living and breathing, if I have a rent to pay 381 euros I will not be able to pay it, so what happens? It happens that, although not having the possibility, not the will, the possibility, I open my portfolio and 381 euros are not there, there are 380, so I can't pay the rent. It will happen that I will obviously accumulate a debt, which arrived at the fourth bill, fifth bill, sixth bill - sometimes there is a tolerance, this must be said -, a dear letter will arrive saying: ""my dear, or you return to this expense or otherwise you go outside here"". The person in question clearly tackles an impossible, improbing challenge, also in this period in which accommodation in the private individual is not found. So how did they organize from other parts, in other regions? I made the example of Piedmont: Piedmont did a very simple thing, most of the regions actually did it; Piedmont has established a series of bands (bands that we also have, however, we have of the bands), but these bands determine precisely the payment that I will have to make; So, depending on my ISEE and depending on the state of the accommodation, I will have to be inserted in the corresponding band and then pay a figure. Here, however, in the part of Piedmont, a different thing is made and, in my opinion, interesting and intelligent: it is said that there is a series of bands, there are 19 bands. The first is the support band: a fee is established, so -called due fee, so you need 100 euros per month of rent, but you are in band 1, and probably band 1 is dedicated to people who perhaps have an ISEE equal to 0, probably (and if I have an ISEE equal to 0, it is easy to think that I do not have the substances to pay anything), so you will have to 35% of the fee due. If you have such a low ISEE, you will have to pay 35% of the fee due. Imagine to say that the fee due is 100 euros and therefore you want to pay 35? There is no maximum fee compared to income for this first band, but there is a fee and precisely Piedmont says to you: ""You will have to pay at least 40 euros per month"". This is for the poorest band. Then, gradually you go up and as you climb with the income, you also go up with the bands. There is the protection band, from n. 2 to n. 8; There is the stability band, from 9 to 13; There is the safety band, from 14 to 18, there is the stay band. What do these bands establish? Establish a maximum limit of fee compared to my income. For example, we take the band n. 8, which is a protective range: it tells you that you have to pay 75% of the fee due, so if the fee due is 100 euros, you have to pay 75 euros. But the maximum fee compared to my income is that it will not be able to exceed 16% of my overall income, so if I have an ISEE of a thousand euros per year, I will not be able to pay more than 16% of that ISEE, but because objectively if I take off the funds for that type of expenditure, I then have no more to live, so there is a limit that is imposed on my income. Do you earn a thousand euros? You cannot pay for rent more than 16% of your income and so to climb. There is, for example, the last band, which is that of stay, which provides for 240% payment compared to the fee due (I guess the stay band is for income certainly probably higher than 20 thousand euros, perhaps to 30 thousand, I don't know) and the maximum fee is 20% compared to my income, with a minimum fee of 300 euros per month. So, there is a table that also allows me to know, transparently, how much I will have to pay and that allows you to safeguard my income, because - and I repeat what I said before - if I am asked more than what I have I will not be able to pay and we will find ourselves having people who are evicted and then with the social services that must deal with the evicted people who have been evicted by the Region itself. So we have a person who is thrown out of the house, who then goes from social policies and says: ""Eh, but I am homeless"", ""How did it happen?"", ""Eh, you threw me out through the arer"". It is a vicious circle that objectively is absurd. If I do not have the substances to be able to afford a rent, I must be able to have the guarantee that it is a popular house, which does not turn to a market, which is not a system to earn, but a social protection system for the weakest people; It is clear that this system must make sure that I am protected. This is why, with this motion, coming precisely to the request we have presented, and we have talked about it several times in this classroom, the colleagues also advanced the revision of the revision of the regional law 3/2013 and was announced, by the councilor, that a work in this sense is being done, the regional government is committed to introducing, when this revision, a method of calculation that provides for a maximum roof to the fee, compared to income, in order to limit the increases. discriminated against and encourage a containment of the costs for fragile assignees."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Marzi,Carlo,1975.0,M,SA,4,11987,"As I have noticed, I connect Manfrin, so far I have absolutely not made merit to any initiative treated so far, as far as I am concerned. This instead allows you to make an analysis, but it is an analysis that also connects to the demanding part. How he can see ... I know that then she will keep the initiative, but when I have tried to represent them what is the object of the dispute, she will notice that, at the end of the fair, let's do well not to vote for her and explain why. First of all, his initiative starts from an assumption, which is rightly that of the Piedmont Region, to say the whole of it. By comparing the calculation systems of Valle d'Aosta and Piedmont, the overall set of the two systems must be taken into consideration, and not just some elements; In fact, in the Piedmontese system, the nuclei that reach an ISEE value equal to the double of the access limit to the ERP, must release the accommodation. Therefore, the beneficiaries are people who find themselves in conditions of effective economic fragility and therefore, consequently, limit the fee to a maximum of 20% of the income has an incidence only on the nuclei that are placed in the lower income bands, given that the higher income nuclei must release the ERP housing. This is regarding Piedmont. Conversely, in the Aosta Valley legislation, there is no limit of ISEE beyond which the accommodation must be issued; So, if we wanted to apply the same meter measuring of Piedmont, some Aosta Valley families could have to pay lease fees abundantly beyond those you have brought as a comparison meter. In fact, it should be remembered that our legislation does not regulate a maximum ISEE value for the purpose of a possible release of the accommodation in case of achievement of economic stability, so, in technical terms, the fact of not having the permanence criteria that allow, as in other Italian regions, the release of the accommodation, but also of not having criteria for permanence defined. You know that one of the things that are evaluating themselves in the table that will involve us I think by the end of this month, because the President of the Commission, in his attention to the theme, gave me the dates in which to convene to face a first synthesis of the research work that the University of Valle d'Aosta is carrying out to arrive to define the new law 3, therefore as a consequence on that occasion I believe that we will have the opportunity to face some aspects that you all know. Basically, however, to make a slightly more technical analysis, you know that, to make it short, there are access assessments, the criteria for accessing public residential construction and then there are criteria for staying. On the access criteria - we have already said it thanks to some initiatives that Baccega colleague did -, what is making itself evident, unlike other initiatives that we are dealing with in this classroom, is that in reality the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta is not a large sleeve region for access to public residential construction. 3 is not a law that, in fact, went to treat in a socially adequate way to the times - and this is why we are changing it - access to public residential construction. First of all because the 3 thought in terms of ISE and not ISEE; Secondly, because, thinking in terms of ISE and not ISEE, it also kept outside the residential construction public a range of population with perhaps some types of difficulties, so the work that this advice is soliciting and that we are in place of variation of the 3 could give positive advantages for the Valle d'Aosta community. The fact of having an ISEE at 8,500 euros - because this is the reference parameter, for example - could ensure that with an ISEE of 30 thousand euros for a nucleus of six people, in fact we would speak of 9,375 euros and we today with an ISEE at 8,500 we keep it out; Not to mention a whole series of aspects that have to do, for example, with disabilities and another series of issues that we will perhaps deal with very short. Coming instead to the permanence criterion, we believe that at this moment we are the only one, or one of the very few Italian regions, which applies to those who access the residential construction public a life access, therefore, basically, when the nucleus accesses the public residential construction remains inside the house - leaving the mobility, because otherwise we complicate too much things -, however, we hypothesize that a nucleus of four people, with the adequate house. of public residential building, or vulgarly called the popular house, we assume that four enter and there are four of them for all their lives, in fact they would have the opportunity to remain within that house all their lives; Therefore, consequently, even the canons, to get to calculate the lease fees, would be fees susceptible to the square meters, the age of the accommodation and the OMI parameters which, at this moment, in that area of ​​the city, are increasing, as we have already had the opportunity to represent for its initiative. The OMI parameters obviously do not choose the autonomous region Valle d'Aosta, but take into account what the market for areas of the city is; Therefore, if the OMI parameters in the area where the public housing in the city of Aosta are growing in the majority are growing, it is because, in fact, it means that, in terms of purchases and sale, there is a market in that area of ​​the city. This is. But the object of the dispute is that if we have - probably the only region of Italy - still a law that allows a nucleus to enter Erp, therefore in the popular house, and to stay there for a lifetime, even to be able to somehow also leave to future generations, you understand well that we, in fact, are accompanying the whole life of this family during its social and economic emancipation. It is possible that a family unit that enters public residential construction in 1980, with a single parent who works and with two young children, then, during the life of the nucleus itself, arrives to have two parents who work or perhaps the reference parent who grows from a professional point of view, the children who grow up, the needs that change, they can even become income recipients, in fact all this part is not collected by the experience within the popular house, stay inside this popular house. Well, if we in some way represented - but this I say it only for correctness of reasoning - the demanding of its initiative, we could even get to bring this nucleus, for a series of motivations that are obviously not the reason why it wants it, to pay even more than what it represents today, for the simple reason that in all regions of northern Italy there would be criteria for which, once you enter the ERP. Indeed, there are public residential contracts with variable duration which, in fact, are renewed and I imagine that they are renewed by evaluating the permanence criteria within the public residential construction. There are also after the other criteria, which in other regions are applied, including the Piedmont Region, which even tell you clear and round, obviously not from today, but through the exit paths from public housing, that when you arrive in emanciparts as a family unit, you from the ERP you have to go out. Consequently, when you say to a nucleus (we remain to the Piedmont region), which has emancipated and has come to become a ""socially richer"" nucleus, you also say that it comes out of public housing. So then, in the list of the calculation that you represented as an example of this initiative, that nucleus is not there, while in the Aosta Valley there is. Since I know that she is very attentive to the theme and that she also knows him well, not only do I agree with her with respect to the fact that all the theme of the innocent arrears has basically a social name, so much so that in recent weeks we have made meetings where we have also involved colleague Sapinet, obviously only for the part of his own that it is not social but the structural one, but, in fact, we also wrote to the ARER, Social service upstream of any choice that has to deal with the stay in the accommodation. And this thing will be increasingly strengthened in the new 3; Not surprisingly, it is since 2023 that we allocate funds in this sense and that with the next stability law we are trying to make it - sorry for the game of words - stable. However, the object of the dispute is precisely the fact that if one were to think about the whole multidisciplinary reinterpretation of this blessed 3 ... ... what does multidisciplinary mean? It means that the access criteria in terms must probably be adapted, passing from the ISEE to the ISEE, this ISEE must then include a series of parameters, naturally secondary, which are those of the implementing resolutions, which probably must be paid to a company other than the one that was there in 2013, that is, 11 years ago, including the Aosta Valley one. When you enter the public residential construction, you should not stay there for life, but there must be parameters for which you have to be accompanied to get out of public residential construction and therefore, consequently, it opens the whole other front that we often deal with in this classroom, which is that of: are the public housing available to this territory enough? How is the management of the number of public housing and all the social tools related to the socio-habitative distress compared to our territory, compared to the fact that our territory is a complex territory and respect, for example, to the PTP of colleague Sapinet which, in theory, does not require a use of zero soil or to decrease certain things? For which this is the multidisciplinarity to which we will have to meet when we reason Erp, but this is also the reason why if we go to take - and I do not say that she did it, let's understand - only a part for example of the choices made by a region close to us, we then risk after making even greater damage than what we are doing today, because in a region that, like ours, does not provide for our own Emancipa is accompanied towards the private market, purchase, lease or other, but remain in public residential construction, if we go to apply the criterion provided in the demanding part of this motion, we actually find ourselves in the condition of going to pay even more to those who have emancipated today. Which I also find correct, let's understand each other well, but he understands that then after I happen to be called to respond to initiatives where he tells me: ""It costs too much"", but probably it costs too much also because in some cases, because in my opinion we could also get to make simulations compared to other laws, we would discover, if we ever do it, that, depending on the region that we examine, there would be nuclei that would already not be part of the public. For this reason, I also tried to speak in the arm, because she appreciates; In fact, I try not to speak to the arm normally, simply because, as you can see, I spoke 13 minutes, instead the times are minor and therefore, consequently, in this way I also try to self-send to the classroom a little less than my face and my voice."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,6,7163,"Don't worry, it is always a pleasure to listen to her, especially when she speaks in the arm. So don't worry about his face, of which we will not do body shaming and we are against any work in this sense; She does and takes responsibility for it with the Prime Minister. But in reality we are pleased and I am pleased above all because she expresses a political thought that instead the reading of cold leaflets does not express. But she, councilor, said a series of things that brought in one direction, now then, closing the speech, said things that tend to be opposed and different. I start by order, so at least we understand each other. I fully agree with her, with the fact that our region does not have a system of exit from public residential construction and I am happy that she, in the conclusion of her intervention, said that this is not right, also because I was obviously afraid that she said: ""No, but we must keep everyone and therefore we cannot put a legislation or a device that contains rents like the one we propose to do"". I am happy that you did it, because it is evident that we have the data in the hand of what are the ISE and ISEE of the people who are in the public residential housing and if you, as I imagine, will have taken a look at them, will discover that in the public residential housing there are people who have an ISEE at 140 thousand euros. Now, it will understand that, personally, if I met the person who with 140 thousand euros of Isee keeps accommodation, a popular house that should be destined for fragile people, for himself, a certain indignation I would manifest him, saying: ""But sorry, but with the income you have, but you cannot be able to look for a housing from another part and leave the house to a poor unknown?"". Since he nods and agrees, then the idea should be what evidently must be put on a limit, exactly as the other regions have done. So if we only introduce a limit of income, we could free a part of those accommodations that are now occupied by people who can pay for, have the necessary substance, to pay for a rent and are not at risk of not having a roof over the head. However, this reasoning, on which you agree, drops all the reasoning that you have done for which this initiative cannot be accepted, because we are not that we say, with this motion, that in the revision of 3/2013 we must do only and only this intervention; We say that, with a view to reviewing Law 3/2013, inserting a reasoning and a method of calculating this type is necessary, because if in the review there should be the provision of a clause for which, after having exceeded a certain income threshold, I leave the accommodation, it is obvious that a table and a mechanism of this type would allow us to guarantee that the rent does not exceed certain levels. If she focuses all the speech to say no to this initiative, with the fact that we have not, however, councilor for this thing, she uses an argumentative fallacy that is objectively very weak. I say and I go back to repeat: if we want to give equity in the assignment, in the management, in maintenance, in the payment of public residential housing, in the list of the discussion of 3/2013, the reasoning to put income limits beyond which people do not have to pay because they do not do it, because they cannot, not because they do not want, is essential. All this goes perfectly and quietly with the two issues that raised: 1) the fact that, having exceeded a certain income threshold, I have to leave the popular house; 2) the fact that the public housing have become hereditary, which is deeply wrong. They can be transmitted to cohabitants if these actually respect certain low income fees, on this they are perfectly agreed, but this is how it works in other parts, so it is clear that our system and our need for revision of the law must go in this direction. However, councilor, net of this and in the face of what I have just said, do not welcome this initiative is wrong, for the simple reason that or she says to me: ""No, look, in the motion, if you want to make proposals, she must insert all of her revision of 3/2013"" and if she wants, I do it, and I also do it for free, without having to commission some university professors who have no more to do in life of charity in favor of photographers and perhaps every now and then some service candidates. In favor of these, if you want, free of charge, I do it as a consultant, available, completely available, without even taking pictures, I come and willingly take them as a consultant. If, on the other hand, the idea is what we have to invent something to reject the initiative, because the initiative actually has its own meaning and value (and she recognized it), but I don't know exactly how to reject it, then I am sorry, she knows that we clarify several times. I think that everyone, net of those who are the tones or net of what are the ideas, sometimes coinciding, sometimes conflicting, recognizes each other an ability and a value, both political and expression, we cannot however say, however, sincerely 1) that the tones used are wrong, 2) that the proposals are not acceptable, because she also recognized it. There are no real reasons for which this motion cannot be accepted. The motivation cannot be: ""Eh, no, but we have a system"", also because, and I will tell them more, if this initiative, and what you said testify to it, was accepted and a calculation method was introduced, which I have highlighted, which acts as a multiplier if the income is superior, as income grows, the increase in the monthly foil for those who have a higher income. Mechanism that disincentive the maintenance of the accommodation of public residential construction. Because if I arrive to take an ISEE of 140 thousand euros a year and I have to multiply the fee due, I only did the example of the nineteenth, that is, the stay, but if we want to calculate it up to such a high ISEE, the minimum multiplier I don't know what it will be, 1000%, 2000% of the fee due to the basic fee, and when a person who has 140 thousand euros of ISEE will find himself paying 3, 4 thousand euros per month of rent. You will do two calculations and will say: ""Maybe it is better that the accommodation releases it and I find one at a private level"". Councilor, in our opinion it is not a political point, it is not a matter of leaving a testimony, it is not a trivial question of communicating one's idea; In our opinion, this initiative, objectively, has its own value and none of the reasons that you have communicated has the value or the possibility of saying that this cannot be implemented. Obviously we will keep the initiative."

These are four years of debate on public residential construction, four years in which little or nothing has been done; More nothing than little. There is this process of law 3 that we have been waiting for for years. We hope that the law arrives as soon as possible, because there are many issues that are at stake: the leases, the arrears, the resolutions of the contracts, the issue of the housing emergency, the concept of adequate accommodation, the methods of assignment, the choice of accommodation ... are all themes that must be addressed. But above all, probably, the regional announcement must also be questioned, because there is an interpretation of this regional announcement, so where there is an accommodation available in Pont-Saint-Martin, or vice versa, in Valpelline, is assigned to the ranking and it is said to it: ""You are from Pont-Saint-Martin? We assign you the accommodation to Valpelline"". It happened, it's not that I'm inventing things about, and if you don't accept it, get out of the ranking. But you can't do this! We must be serious and the arer absolutely applies this method. We clearly know that this law is not adequate, we await it and the demanding of the motion that was presented by the colleagues of the League also goes in the direction of making a more serious reasoning also than the lease: at this point, introducing the maximum text will be important and absolutely mandatory, also because there are no housing, there are none decent accommodation. It is true that a whole series of works are ongoing, but before two or three years we do not see them, despite the promises that have been made several times in the commission ""will be ready, they will be ready, they will be"" but in reality at the time of ready we have seen very few. Accommodation are assigned which are impossible and often rejected, most of the time they are rejected, and this is an element that must be taken into consideration. We will therefore vote with conviction this motion, believing that this commitment must also be taken into consideration in the new formulation of the law, and we will be careful in this sense; And above all, hoping that this law is questioned as soon as possible, precisely to show what are the real and concrete problems that public residential construction over the years - because obviously things have changed in the last decade - has manifested."

There are other bands, which are bands in difficulty, but perhaps not in absolute poverty, which should, with the use of the ISEE not of the ise, be involved in the future law 3. 2) the next reinterpretation of law 3 will have requirements that will provide for the fact that a core that emancipates, therefore a nucleus that improves its situation, no longer is entitled to remain in a popular house. When this will be possible, at that point it will also be possible to predict what is made evident by its initiative. So the motion cannot be voted, but, in political line, we absolutely agree with what you are representing and that will be identified at the level of law 3, because, to date, what are the requirements that provide that a family unit that is good is already outside the ERP, in fact it is not taken into consideration. 3) the fact that in all respects everything must be managed upstream by social policies and therefore, consequently, the fact that everything that has to do with public residential construction must be placed under the hat of the socio-habitative distress; Therefore, consequently, even everything that is decided over a nucleus must be inserted within a whole series of initiatives which, in fact, have to do with the attention that the social policies department is already making available to the reference nucleus. 4) When this type of choices will have to be made, as mentioned also by colleague Baccega, probably at that point it will also be necessary to take note of the fact that there is a need to have another series of tools to be joined to public residential construction with respect to the theme of socio-habitative discomfort. Certainly to date, the support for lease is one of the tools available to the vast world of socio-habitative discomfort that is working in this region, we should probably also tend to make a whole series of assessments compared to the social emancipation of a nucleus that has been in a popular house for a long time, but everything, including the numbers I have given you, is a photograph of what the 3 was not taking into consideration. If all this I am telling you, it is because, in fact, everything this is absolutely in the course of work. Then I understand how much colleague Baccega says; Obviously I cannot agree with him with respect to the fact that, in the course of these three and a half-four or five years, political choices have not been made on public residential construction, but this is part of the different roles that we have in the Council at this moment. However, what I say is that, regardless of the assessments that the Manfrin colleague every time he nicely represents compared to his vision of those who are also collaborating on this thing, in the specific case, leaving people alone, and instead coming to the research studies, what we can absolutely represent is that these studies are of the end of 2023-early 2024, so if we are very able to arrive with the month of November, which has already taken into consideration, Numbers with a series of possible solutions, given that then after the research study that was commissioned to the University of Valle d'Aosta also provides for a synthesis of a proposal of a new 3, probably, without giving reason to those who say that we have done nothing, because it is not true, in all respects we would absolutely have already given very strong addresses because the 3 is admitted to the Valle d'Aosta society of 2024, 2025,2026, 2027, 2028, except. All that I am representing, of course, is a prospect of administrative temporal time for different roles, which sees the solutions in the same way, that is, we all agree that the 3, as it works today, cannot work in the future and therefore probably the one that will become the new 3 will also have the possibility of exiting or the invitation to exit from the public residential construction of the nuclei that have emancipated and therefore also has the possibility of applying this. Motion today provides."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,5316,"Councilor, sees, this is one of the few times, I must confess to him, that I see her particularly in difficulty in defending a choice that she makes, a choice of classroom, of course. I see it in difficulty because she usually has a motivation, shareable or not, and, on the basis of this motivation, seeks, in a different way, with various modulations on the theme, to convince the interlocutor, or at least who listens. Instead, she is already the third different motivation that addresses for the failure to accept this motion. Then, she said in the order: that this motion cannot be accepted because there is no rule that provides for the exit from public housing; Then he said that the acceptance of the insertion of what we ask within the revision of the 3/2013 would lead to an increase in the fees that would lead to the removal of people, that is, exactly the objective that we then put in inserting in the 3/2013, the people who obviously improve their economic condition. Then now he told us, councilor, that what we ask for already doing it, that it is more or less what perhaps said Marco's colleague. So, see, councilor ... interruption out of the microphone no, I have no idea what you share in the majority, but perfect ... I have no idea what you share: I listened to the declaration of vote of the colleague of Marco and therefore, based on that, I intervene, if I am allowed. What is the question? The question is very simple: that this is a system that works, that is, I put a limit of income beyond which I cannot pay, so I have an income X, I can pay for the maximum Y, not more, because otherwise I don't have the money. That the system can be inserted with a view to the revision: we do not write in the commitment that must be included now, we ask that it will be inserted with a view to the revision. If you say that there must be a tool first to bring out the people who have improved their condition, it is clear that the two must be done together. Then, when you are inserting a way for which people who have improved their economic condition must exit, is compatible with the approval of this motion which asks exactly in that method of concord, that method of processing with respect to the new law, to also insert a new calculation mode. So that you are already doing him, councilor, it's not a motivation, but she did not say it in her intervention, she said a different thing. Regardless of this, now you have evoked another question, that is, the question of the study. I am sorry, I do not want to talk about people, net of the things that make us smile, make everyone smile in here, because the world is small and the Aosta Valley even more, but the thing that I sudden me, I wonder: ""But what is the competence of the people who are elaborating these studies?"" Why is this the problem, do you understand? Because of the people who are elaborating these studies, I would really like to know what competence they have to tell us what it must be done. What competence do they have? Why if the competence is to be university professors who teach a subject that has nothing to do with public residential construction, I am sorry, but unfortunately there is no competence, there is not, and being part of associations or foundations is not a requirement that makes you compatible with the assignment, understand? If a person who does not have the skills tells me what I have to do with a regional law, I objectively and honestly I cannot accept that evaluation, regardless of who it is; But if we take the curriculum, and we have seen the curriculum, we know that the skills are not there; And this is a concern, because then the effects of that elaborate law will be discharged, exactly as it happened with the 3/2013, on the innocent roommates, because perhaps tomorrow to administer there will always be someone who believes that he is a condominium administrator and must simply harass the people to ask them for the rent, instead of understanding social difficulties. So what he has just said is welcome, that is, the fact that public residential construction must be managed in concert with social policies. It is correct, it is the correct approach, I perfectly agree, it is one of the few sensible things we have heard in this discussion. Welcome. However, the fact that all this is given as a motivation in order not to accept the motion, sincerely, councilor, has nothing to do with it, it is not an impediment, on the contrary, the two can go hand in hand: the exit from the ERP as well as the fixation of an income limit. Did he want to give a motivation? Councilor, he did not succeed. If you want, do not vote for the motion, it seems to me that things are clear, but this will evidently remain a stain compared to a debate that, in my opinion, instead should be a participatory and perhaps shared debate, because a law of this type will regulate, as she rightly said, the public residential construction of the future and we talk about the fate of thousands of fragile people who, if they were faced with the wrong choice, will pay dearly."
47903,XVI,06/11/2024,"EDILIZIA, Edilizia residenziale",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,16,2178,"I had already announced that our vote was favorable, but the intervention of the commissioner somehow allows me to say other things. In reality, my first intervention had been short precisely because we are waiting to see that holy document that will be called Law 3, which we have requested for years, has been 4 years, and if my statement of the first was what has been done little or nothing, there are then the data, there is colleague Charrian who is good and says: ""The public administration speaks for acts and the public administration speaks for results"". The results are there for all to see: there is a ranking of over 600 people waiting for the popular house, a series of evictions have been made in the rather significant years, there are people who sleep in the car, the fees are not adequate, they are fees that are obviously to be reviewed, the condominium expenses, for those families who are strongly in economic difficulty, are exorbitant because they have been obliged to be enchanted in Telcha. The innocent arrears are a arrears that has been financed but, in reality, it spends little because they are all families that have not had the lowering of income as those defaulted nuclei somehow are either retirees or people who are unemployed, this is the actual data. These are the data that allow me to say that in recent years little has been done, or little or nothing. In the years that she knows, we have been together, probably some passages will remember it, every year we assigned 120-130 accommodation to the ranking, there was mobility, and there were no resources that are now there. We had had the resources that are now there, we would have gone to wedding, because we would have gone to do a much more profitable job, probably the fifth lot would have been done before, etc. These are therefore the statements, we really hope for that document to compare ourselves, to make reflections, the assessments on the new bill that we hope can give the Valle d'Aosta community of the concrete answers and update these data that I have placed them."

We all know that the bill was approved in the Chamber: ""Provisions on public safety, protection of staff on duty, as well as victims of usury and penitentiary system"". This bill is now in the Senate. We highlight that in the 38 articles of the ""Security"" bill 13 new cases of crime appear, more varied aggravating circumstances, including: article 10, which provides for imprisonment of up to a month for the road or railway block committed by a single and from six months to two years if the crime is committed by several people gathered; Article 15, which opens the possibility of prison also to pregnant and mothers, and infants; Article 19, relating to crimes of violence or threat and resistance to public officials, with the aggravating planned if the fact is committed to prevent the creation of a public work or a strategic infrastructure, such as, for example, the bridge over the Strait or the Turin/Lyon railway line; Article 28 with which public security agents are authorized to bring some types of firearms without license; Article 32, which provides for the closure of the exercise of activities from 5 to 30 days for shopkeepers who sell SIM cards without proceeding to identify customers and so on. With all these new rules inserted, the government has decided to want to manage numerous social issues, according to our point of view, in the most illiberal way possible, that is, repressing with the use of the criminal system of prison, instead of opening up to dialogue and listening, while intervening to alleviate the problems that grip the towns and citizens, which is what we would expect instead from a democracy. For us to balance the security measures with the protection of individual freedoms is important and for this reason we recall the principle that security policies should in no case compromise the fundamental rights of citizens, such as privacy, freedom of movement and expression. In this sense there is already a first response to what the colleague Manfrin said today, because this flyer was on the union bulletin board, according to my point of view, also rightly, because the right to show workers is also somehow affected. I highlight it because it seems to me that, from what he said, then I have not verified on the union bulletin board, but it is not that there are all the initiatives ... Obviously there are the initiatives that are most dedicated to workers in some way. I did not analyze with the attention that the colleague paid compared to the bulletin board, but a first answer, in my opinion, is there. A right, which is the right to demonstrate, at this moment is somehow limited with the ""security"" decree, so I think it is important that workers know that by manifesting this can become a crime against them. In our opinion, there is also the importance of also providing monitoring and transparency mechanisms for new measures so that their application can be controlled and that they do not somehow also be abused. Democratic control is essential to prevent the tightening of safety standards from being used also disproportionately. This is why the demanding is very simple. Meanwhile, we will understand how colleagues think, many of us participated in those events, have also authenticated signatures, therefore, from a certain point of view, they also activated compared to this issue and what we would like to bring out is what the classroom think, having surely certainties compared to those in front of me, because I already imagine what will say. The commitment, however, is to activate the regional government, to take action to the Aosta Valley parliamentarians because the excerpt of this bill is requested from the national government and to the Parliament, which for us is somehow also an attack on the democratic principles that we consider important. As I said, I already imagine what will be said by some people, but this is our thoughts and therefore we also wanted to submit to the classroom and understand also colleagues what they think. It is acknowledged that the President Bertin summarizes the presidency from 19.41."

I certainly personally, this is a bill that I do not approach. There is no doubt about this. But where do I go to lose here? On the commitment. The demanding of this motion is over, you can no longer do, it is the past. The deputy has already voted. We had to ask the Senator, who we know very well ... (intervention of a councilor outside the microphone) ... but they will be the ones who will have to tell him. Therefore on this motion ... (intervention by a councilor outside the microphone) ... there is not even suspense, dear adviser, because it is clear, has passed. This motion must be withdrawn. That is, they have already played the music, what do we do now? Are we going to make us laugh behind? Because if we present something of this kind, we make ourselves laugh behind. What do they tell us? They tell us that you have voted in the room, we are waiting for the Senate ... and the senator is clearly deployed. Therefore this is a motion that, according to my point of view and the movement that I represent, must be withdrawn."

This is a question of institutional grace, because, from a certain point of view, we have two parliamentarians. After that I imagine that the deputy also has contacts with senators, right? It is hoped at least that in some way not only you work with the senator, but also works in another way. This is hoped that it is not there alone and small. So what somehow we ask is that he also activates himself to ask for the excerpt, that is, from this point of view, I believe that he can very well do it independently of what he voted or has not voted, if he has already voted, and so on. Activating to ask for the excerpt is something that can very well do. From this point of view, then ... if you want to amend and write that we only ask the senator and you want to do this, but it would be important to understand what your position is, which cannot entrench yourself behind, honestly, to these motivations that we have heard at this moment."

I would make a proposal: either withdraw the motion and, as forces contrary to the provisions of the bill I know, I do not know, submit a board initiative of the national law that goes to ask for the repeal of a law approved by the state and therefore the left forces are compact and present ... or actually there may be a modification of the commitment where the writing is proposed, obviously by our group there will be no vote in favor, I already say it, We will abstract, or present the initiative because someone, in this case the government, write a text of the board initiative law, perhaps for the pen of a majority councilor, certainly very experienced in this ... to present a bill of council initiative towards the Italian state, which goes to repeal this type of demanding. I then doubt that it is supported by Senator Spelgatti, I don't know what the deputy can do, but it can be a proposal. Thus the demanding cannot be voted because the excerpt today, once approved, objectively it can be asked precisely ...

There is no lack of specific sanctions for those who protest against public works defined as strategic, such as the bridge over the Strait or the Tav, currently sanctioned with slight penalties and fines. By Ilaria Salis, accused of having participated in 2008 in an illegal occupation of a property abandoned to the latest generation events, the majority led by Giorgia Meloni does not forget anyone in its repressive dedications. A package of measures is dedicated to prisons, not already looking for solutions to the problems that are highlighted and reported daily, primarily the suicide emergency, to which we unfortunately witness month after month. The direction you take is the one you least need. The postponement of the penalty for the mothers of children lower per year or for pregnant women is made optional, the crime of revolt in prison is also introduced, which includes not only violent acts, but also the passive resistance to orders, such as the hunger strike, punished from 1 to 5 years. Then comes a new aggravating circumstance to the crime of instigation to disobey the laws: if committed within a penitentiary or against detained people, the penalty can be increased up to a third. Same rules in the CPRs, the stay centers for repatriations, treated, as logical to the right, by real detention centers, with the addition of the ban on the purchase of a telephone sim to migrants without the residence permit. With Article 18, and on the government decision, Cannabis Light is equated with drugs, making it illegal to sale, import, processing, distribution and transport in all its form, destroying, or at least trying to destroy, in fact, an industrial supply chain, fortunately suspended provision, from the Lazio Tar, which has given reason to the growers of this plant. The urban daspo is widening, or the ban on access to some urban areas even for those who have only been reported or sentenced in a non -definitive way in the last 5 years for a series of crimes if these have occurred in stations or airports. The so -called ""Security Decree"", which someone has rightly renamed ""Repression Decree"", is a liberticidal law, which brandishes the criminal code against unions, students and students and all the people who want to express their dissent in a non -violent way, a decree that to the problems and social injustices of our country responds with the tightening of the penalties by despising our Constitution. These rules, in addition to not resolving the problems, aggravating the work of the police forces and to deceive the courts more, will only make the current situation worse, creating a climate of greater insecurity between the towns and citizens. This is obviously the ultimate goal of those who have lived politically for years, fueling fears and conspiracysumes."

As for the merit, we would like to make some considerations on this decree. We believe that the ""security"" decree corresponds to the needs of the country to guarantee a respectful coexistence among citizens. I have listened carefully to the positions that are legitimate, but that we do not share at all and that are far from our way of seeing the organization of society. To say that you have to work on the formation of citizens who live on the inconvenience or who have problems is a beautiful declaration of intent, between two or three generations we will see the results. In the meantime we find citizens, according to what you say, who can afford to illegally occupy a property, a private property of others and must not be punished. There are citizens who can manifest themselves in the middle of a highway, to block the country, which can block railway lines, which can block transport. In your opinion, does this mean to demonstrate? The democratic manifestations are made in another way for our way of interpreting the organization and democratic life of a country. It seems to us that, in this respect, there was the need to intervene, because we must also be respectful of the freedom of others. It is not that because I claim a right, my freedom, I can put the overall organization of society in crisis. There are ways to express one's principles, your voice and ideas, in our opinion, in a very different way from those we have heard. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we are deeply convinced that it goes a little more security in this country, conditions go so for us to guarantee the conditions for everyone to live peacefully. In our way of seeing and interpreting the institutional organization, we cannot afford to crisis the lives of others. For this reason, therefore, on the merits, we announce it, our vote is against the commitment that has been proposed."

47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,40,14445,"... yes, in the intervention I think I can ... since we are talking about this debate. I therefore made a reference to the facts that harm the honor of a councilor. Having been the recipients of some invitations, I believed it was important, since the person who made it responsible was the first to put the tip, the lighthouse, the finger at other people, to point out this step, but we will talk about this, so much the recordings are there, so we will have the opportunity to talk about it later, do not worry. As far as the merit of the initiative is concerned, I would like to thank the colleagues very calmly, because I believe it is actually an important theme, on which the discussion allows us to express our thoughts and allows us to express it in any case different between us and you, who have proposed it, and we appreciated, I personally appreciated also the calm tones with which you have rightly expressed your opposition. Instead, I appreciated a little less, but this is in the game of the parties ... and I understand the rather agitated intervention of those who, unfortunately, are forced to bavaglio to never be able to intervene, especially when there are themes that concern something they would like to say, so as not to be stolen even the last voter who has remained, right from the two colleagues who have proposed this initiative and instead he is always forced to silence ... in fact I saw some particularly dark colleague in the face, Speaking with this vehemence he threw out weeks and weeks of broods, of not expressed words. To come instead to the merits of the initiative, we say that even compared to what has been said, connects Guichardaz, surely, when we intervene on the merits of the events, the right to show is limited, but let's not forget that the right to express one's dissent is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is clear that I cannot do it in the way I like most, but I have to follow certain rules. Obviously, the Constitution also provides that there is an application of the rules for events. For the events, it has already been said, but I think it is important, a stop has been put in some ways that objectively they had shown themselves particularly wrong to manifest their thoughts. I think there is no problem, and there has never been, in organizing initiatives, public meetings, fashion shows, processions. We also saw it here in the Aosta Valley, different facts have been made and, when they are peaceful, they do not create any problems. It is different when these then intervene and maybe suspend a public service or create an obstacle. We have all seen, for example, the famous initiatives that have become quite famous all over the world ... In a part of the world, in the western world, what allows you to do it because in others they do not allow themselves. I don't know, those who manifest for the climate, I don't know if they are all called ""fridays for future"" or have different acronyms. The blocking of the traffic that is made evidently has big problems: if I block the traffic, I do not block only the person who is going to the cinema, block the person who is going to work and maybe risks dismissal, block the ambulance with a person on board who risks dying, blocks a series of connections that certainly do not favor the call of attention, indeed they are even counterproductive for two reasons: first, surely the people who remain in the traffic are not happy in the traffic. And they certainly don't get passionate about the theme; Secondly, the machines stopped in traffic certainly produce much more CO2 while remaining stopped there, surely those are not the modalities. I have heard of a crime of revolt and ""anti Gandhi standard"", which, however, was actually used wrongly because this case of crime has been introduced for the prison interiors and this rule provides that ""anyone within the prison participates in a revolt through acts of violence or threats or resistance to the execution of the orders given by three or more people gathered is punished with the imprisonment from 1 to 5 years. The acts of resistance are also the conduct of passive resistance: we imagine, for example, the walking and prisoners who refuse to return to the cell as protest when you have to return. We have seen the acts clearly protest of that type. The prisoners clearly have all the rights, they have lawyers who go to prison them, they can manifest what they want, there are methods in those structures that, however, are not good and these modalities, this same case is expected for the centers of detention and welcome of migrants. It is therefore not for all events, but for some types. Then we talked about the prisoners with children. A problem was addressed that unfortunately it was a serious problem, because there was a repeat of mothers' crime, which actually hid behind their children so as not to end up behind the bars and who used this as an excuse to continue baggage. Perhaps in our reality we realize less, but in the realities that have subway or trains, unfortunately, this is a reality that is very present and has become a plague. I think that anyone who sees the news can notice it. Clearly here we do not talk about taking and banging people behind bars, but, since the sentence provides a postponement here, in that case the execution of the sentence will not be postponed, not always, but ""if the judge will recognize the risk that further crimes can be committed and will be able to take place in an institution with attenuated custody for prisoners"". The penalties are also tightened for those who use minors for begging and the maximum penalty goes from 3 to 5 years. Again: Cannabis has been talked about. This government has said it from the beginning: we are evidently against the use of drugs, whether they are light or heavy, we do not rightly do this type of distinction. I honestly have to say only one thing: it makes me a lot of pain who, to endure their day, find his personal relaxation or outburst in ""spipating"" a little drug. I feel a lot of pain for him and, sincerely, I think there are different ways, different ways of being able to live one's life and to also be able to find a moment of leisure and relaxation. What has been said about the sentences is actually true, but the government, of course, from this point of view, will continue to move forward. Again: we talked about events and sit-in. There will be a block, as we said, not only on the part of the roads but also on the tracks, because unfortunately a person is sufficient on a track to completely block a train and a connection. We realize what evidently can happen. What has been said ... the aggravating circumstance of dissent on works of great importance unfortunately has made itself necessary because, for great works that are essential for our country, like the Tav, unfortunately it has come to the urban war to be able to defend a work that is truly indispensable and to connect the corridor 5, which unfortunately is a necessity. Moreover, for example, the Democratic Party has never denied this position and the need to build this work when it was in the government. I believe this was a need for everyone, not just a political part. Again: the penalties for damage in the demonstrations have been tightened. Indeed, manifesting in a peaceful way is not only allowed, but is desired. It is right to manifest and I much prefer those who manifest, those who expose themselves, show that they do not agree in an absolutely peaceful way compared to those who maybe get away and go to break the windows, break the cars and maybe breaks it to a poor man who has to wake up and go to work, who has nothing to do with it, but, ""since I have to manifest, I have a split"". We remember the interview with that boy who said: ""Well, if you don't split things to the events ... that is brothel!"". Unfortunately, those people must be punished and deserve to be punished, it is clearly evident. Again: there is an extension of the urban daspo. We also consider this a useful measure to be able to bring some order back to those cities that are certainly today, unfortunately, also prey to a petty crime, which is called micro, but that in reality the people who live those realities feel important on their own skin. In the manifesto, in the flyer that was then put on the union bulletin board, it was said that we take it with migrants. She also said, connects Guichardaz, in her speech. Why? Because simply a common sense rule is inserted, that is, it is not that you take it with someone, simply the case is created for which, in the event that the companies should sell SIM cards without observing the identification obligations for customers, the sanction of the closing of the exercise or activity for a period from 5 to 30 days is applied. It is clear that you cannot sell sims to people who do not even have a regular residence permit, people of this type in theory are irregular immigrants and in this country they should not be there. Eventually, we know, you know it better than us and you also know very well the associations that defend them, they have every right to go and ask for the right of asylum, they can do it and, if the right of asylum is denied, they evidently have no title to stay here. If they have no title to stay here, why should they be able to have a SIM? To stay here illegally, perhaps to perform crimes? Because in theory, if they are not legally, they cannot work, they cannot have a contract. How do they earn to live? I think these are the reliefs that everyone should be placed, but of common sense. I don't think there are safe things, as has been said. Crime of arbitrary occupation. This is not talking about this, but it is important. The part of illegal occupation of housing has truly become an important situation and we are also suffering some cases. Councilor Marzi knows ... I know, I imagine, also the commissioner Sapinet by virtue of their occupation with respect to the residential construction part, there are people who unfortunately have abusively occupied housing, even public housing, and unfortunately to send them away ... not those who cannot pay because they don't make it, but those who occupy these houses because they do not have the opportunity to find another, but they are clearly abused ... cleared. In fact, the crime is introduced because ""anyone who occupies and holds a property for a property intended for the home of others or prevent access to the legitimate owner is punished with a penalty from 2 to 7 years. The rule? This is a nice novelty? It is also valid for the appurtenances such as car garage, courtyards, balconies, terraces. Same fate for anyone who intrudes or cooperate in the occupation of the property, or it will receive money, utility for the employment itself "". The plague therefore that there is in other areas to occupy the popular houses by interposed person by renting them. Again: an aggravating circumstance for crimes in the stations and in the meter, we said before, that we do not hear but that are absolutely present. Then a whole part on the modification of the anti -mafia code to make it more effective. Trivially, the interruption of the benefits to relatives of the mafia ... if they interrupt relationships with the relative who, in fact, has been arrested, or is a subject recipient of prevention measures or subjected to a relative criminal proceeding. Again - this is a rule on which we have really focused a lot -: the revocation of citizenship if there is a condemnation for terrorism or serious crimes. ""It extends from 3 to 10 years and from the final sentence to the final sentence to be able to adopt the revocation of citizenship for crimes of terrorism and subversion and other serious crimes. We cannot proceed with the revocation of citizenship if the interested party does not have or cannot acquire another"". Finally, the crime of detention of material with terrorist purposes is still: ""Anyone will be punished with imprisonment from 2 to 6 years, outside the cases of association with terrorism and training purposes to activities with terrorism purposes, consciously procure or holds instructions for the fulfillment of terrorism acts, dissemination and education on the preparation and use of explosive or toxic substances for the purpose of completing the crimes against the personalities of the state "". We believe that these are common sense choices. On this and on security, the League evidently carried out very strong choices, choices that were in government programs, choices that we have claimed and choices that are absolutely compatible, obviously they will be once approved in the Senate. Before, at the beat level, I told Marco's colleague who intervened that it was not known if the colleague Spelgatti would then vote for the measure in the Senate. I have not consulted with her, of course, for this initiative, but I can with discreet confidence not to be denied, that obviously Senator Spelgatti will instead vote for this provision. It will vote and apply it as it is right that it is, because evidently, as we have undergone, unfortunately, in years of governments that tended to see little alternation, they saw a prevalence of the Democratic Party, which was able to go to govern even when it lost the elections, for once we have an elected government that on a program obviously collected consent and on this, evidently, it will carry on what she promised to do. In good title, regardless of the feasibility or non -feasibility of the motion, I would like to thank the colleagues for introducing it and allowed us to express ourselves and obviously announcement that, if the motion is not withdrawn, the Lega group will vote contrary."

It is quite evident that in any case I do not recognize myself, we do not recognize ourselves in the least in those who, in the name of Moloch, must express at all costs and with all means, prevents the performance of the normal activity of a company. We don't recognize ourselves. They are visions, we respect the different position, but we do not recognize ourselves in the least, just as we do not agree on the disarm the police. On my own, on our own, the police are called law enforcement agencies because they exercise and have strength in the name of the order, or they are law enforcement and it is allowed that they do exactly what the name expresses, the expression, otherwise there is a small short philological or even simply logical circuit. It is clear that all this is not only for a question of fans, because we know, among other things, that we unfortunately live in a country where the problems are not even the offenders or those who delinque, or those who transgress the rules or those with their behaviors makes social life difficult. The problem is those who cheer for these, and there is, there are political areas that do it, but I don't want to open this speech. We are on the other side. We are with the police, we are with an order, we are with the rules, on the side of the rules and all this we do not for partisans, not for fans, but simply because we put people's safety first in a society, in a community. The safety of being able to do your job, to go to work and not find a block while someone goes to open their business. We are for the safety of those who start by train and know that at a certain time this train will arrive at your destination. We are for this security. However, the important thing is that truly, in a perhaps irritated way, and to which you are not used to, colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli, I want to make you sincere compliments, because you have highlighted a vulnus, which appeared very evident in this discussion, of the majority. There was an absolutely shareable intervention by Marco's colleague. I can tell him as a military military person on leave, very strategic, impeccable. He did not make a turn. I congratulate her too, Collega Di Marco, found the perfectly logical logical way, to get out of the impasse of having to take a position of choice regarding this motion, which would have put the majority a little in difficulty, which evidently consists of heterogeneous political forces, a left component and an autonomist component, assuming that the autonomist component is not left. However, the fact is that the speech of Marco's colleague had his beautiful location, a logic, a logical thread, a conductor line and then there was the intervention of his colleague Padovani, on whose content I do not recognize myself, but also to her, colleague Padovani, I congratulate, because telling the truth is a sign of consistency. She consistently wanted to express her political position, trying to climb over the left, on the end left, the protagonists of this initiative and of this motion, the subscribers of this motion. In his positioning in the far left he has shown that the majority really has enormous eterogeneity, but above all this heterogeneity is not only the fact of saying: well, we go to recognize the egg of Columbus. What do you have to do the left with the autonomists? Which is what we are not only wondering, but since 2020 he has been asking for the Aosta Valley. It reveals the fact that all this debate and this different positioning emerged after about twenty minutes of interruption, of a majority meeting for evidently, I think, I presume, I decide what positions to take during the discussion of the motions. What was it that went wrong then? You have decided that there will be a part, represented by Di Marco, who represents a part of the majority and then the other part represented by Padovani, who strongly takes a political positioning that climbs to the left the subscribers of the motion. This is what it is curious, this is what it is important, that's what emerges, because it is so clear that I could be here to speak until tomorrow but I do not convince the opposite part, I do not convince the colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli to change his position, I do not convince her, colleague Padovani, to change ideological position, but I wonder: she is part of an area of ​​a party that is also represented by her two neighbors, by the commissioner Guichardaz. So is you representing the party? Are you representing itself? I would like to understand the others of the majority what they think. What is the position of the majority? Is it the position of Di Marco or the other position? This is an important element and this is the reason why I congratulate colleagues Guichardaz and Minelli. You have made this absolutely contradictory situation emerge and this is the majority that is governing the Valle d'Aosta region."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,44,3264,"I will not take long, I want to reassure colleagues who are tired, and we are all. The colleague Guichardaz has already said, of course, if we present this motion, it is because we are absolutely convinced of its validity and the fact that the ""security"" decree, the bill that has been approved in the Chamber and that must be discussed in the Senate is dangerous and is absolutely contrary to a series of issues that we consider important. I do only one example, which is the one linked ... there would be many, but I only do this, which is linked to the question of the ban on selling sims to irregular migrants. I borrow the declaration that was made by Oliviero Forti, who is the immigration manager of the National Caritas, who said that this is a highly discriminatory measure, especially for a matter: because only people who are somehow totally irregular are not affected, but who incur this ban and therefore will be deprived of this possibility ... (intervention of a councilor, outside the microphone) please! ... will also be deprived of this possibility also all those who are waiting for a residence permit, who have all the requirements, have finished the process and are only waiting to have that piece of paper that allows them to be able to look for a job and be here. I also report the position of the Church, because this was on ""Avvenire"", which I believe has not yet become an extremist newspaper. I don't really think. There are also perplexities from a whole series of magistrates, prisons directors, who are worried about the effects that this type of bill will have. Step to the second part briefly. It has been said by Marco's colleague that this motion is overcome, which does not make sense because in any case the bill has already been voted in the Chamber. Now, the bill has been devoted to the Chamber, to become definitive it must also be voted in the Senate, but nothing prevents some parts of that bill from being modified. If a bill is approved by one of the two chambers and the other branch of Parliament, it makes even minimal changes, that is, it does not vote for the text that has come approved by the first chamber, this must return. The Senate could make changes, if it will make even small changes, the text will return to the Chamber and the Chamber will vote no longer on the whole bill, but only on the modified part. From a formal point of view, therefore, there is nothing that prevents this from going on. Go see you, that's the case. If not, we would have abolished bicameralism in Italy, but at the moment it is still so. Then in the whole another series of issues that colleague Manfrin faced, with much more calm tones than usual, but because there had already been the previous outburst, we would have to reply point on point. We don't have time, it's late, we're tired. Certainly the motion will not be withdrawn and the vote, as I think has also said someone else, will then have to, as on many other occasions, be the litmus test of what people actually say, think and act, because otherwise they are words, words, words."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Marguerettaz,Aurelio,1963.0,M,UV,46,4199,"Obviously not for a question of landingness, but I return that the first passage is absolutely not compliant, because the order motions are specific motions. The regulation says: ""Calls to the regulation or for the agenda or for the priority of voting"". Finished. What she invoked was a personal question or, mostly, she had to ask for the juris of honor, the honorability. He had no title to stop Padovani. That said, therefore, also the recall of the assessments to the regulation ... They are particular, but she has made no reference to the regulation, nor the order of voting, nor anything else. On the motion I believe that in the end there is a specific activity simply to plant flags, exactly like the ""security"" decree. Because the ""Security"" decree, you see, introduce and leverage the problems that are real. How to disconnect the fact that there are real problems of public order? The problem is to understand whether the ""security"" decree solves them, because this is this we must talk about. Marco's colleague said: ""We are against, but because we believe that this tool is a propaganda tool. I explain to me. If one thing is prohibited, because already a whole series of facts are prohibited, it is not increasing the penalties that we solve the issues. Because here we do beautifully advertising, electoral propaganda. A whole series of crimes that you have already indicated are not allowed and then if they are not allowed, Logic to say: ""We increase the penalties"" you think of solving the problem? The motorway? No. From this point of view, that's why we say that this is an instrument that is absolutely propaganda and, if the colleagues had had some intellectual honesty, they should have recalled the opposite vote of our deputy, who voted against already in September. From this point of view, we already cleared the field on the fact that this majority, made up of people who roughly represent a bit of all the movements that supported the candidacy of our deputy ... to understand what the orientation was, but not because we do not know the problem! We know the problem, but, from this point of view, the tool is an incorrect and propaganda tool, as exactly propaganda, you will allow me, this motion, because it is simply to be able to make a reckoning inside the left area. We believe that the demanding is an unwitting commitment, because if someone had written: ""committed to soliciting the parliamentarians to vote against"", could it also make sense, but what the hell of democracy do you have in mind? The excerpt. The excerpt of what? That is, a bill that is under discussion in Parliament ... (intervention by Councilor Minelli, out of the microphone) ... No, but you have not written what you want the excerpt. You talked in general of the excerpt ... have you also taken the way of doing manfrin? (intervention by Councilor Minelli, out of the microphone) ... so you make me a personal question ... no, because you took on the fact that you insisted, I think colleague Minelli has considered that that is an example to follow, therefore to speak above the colleagues. The excerpt of what? In the commitment, the excerration tout court, of the whole decree law, is written. Look, it doesn't work like this. If it's a rag, say what you want to excerpt; If it is to vote against, say that you have to vote against; If it is voting against, we have already satisfied you, we have already done it. For something that is already done, for us this motion, as it is set, is unreachable. For dignity we will not vote against, we refrain, because you have presented an improper thing from a technical point of view."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,48,5552,"Much, very briefly, first of all I understand and understand perfectly, connects Margurettaz, which happens a few times, because I have to recognize them a particular ability, she has attended this classroom for several years and knows the functioning of this classroom in depth. A couple of times, however, he must admit that he has been caught on the counterattack and this is one of those times. As I said, I therefore also understand the reasoning that he did subsequently, because he will never admit it, of course, but, if there had not been this diatribe, both regulatory and other, I am sure that she would not have intervened, nor would it have expressed an opinion. Obviously he would have left, as hundreds of other times did, that some of his majority colleagues on the merits were probably expressed. She does not usually take a position and would not have expressed the positions she expressed, because obviously today she has a bit the tension of the post game on and is and I understand it, so we know well what happens. However, what she probably did not understand is what is the content, but I say it absolutely without animosity and without wanting to trigger a debate, also because we will certainly have to discuss again in the next few days. Article 60 of our regulation establishes that ""the calls to the regulation, or for the agenda, or for the priority of voting? Are three different cases, therefore or call to the regulation, or for the agenda or for priority? Interrupt the discussion"". We agree on this, we established that they interrupt the discussion and interrupt the intervention: that's why I obviously said ... obviously what happens? That, if I ask with an order motion to intervene, then interrupt the discussion, at that point I receive the word from the president who asks me to explain the order motion. Which, however, was not done, because, when I asked for the floor to intervene, the colleague was not blocked and I was not given the opportunity to explain the order motion. So I felt insisted, because my right was to make a reference to the regulation. The reference to the regulation, which I then did, was precisely for article 58, therefore facts that harm the honor of a councilor. It is therefore clear that the failure to suspend the discussion and the non -word to the undersigned evidently made me intervene in a way vehemently, also because, as it will remember at the beginning of this three days of advice, I had received a deck from the president, who had cared for me to be ... as we could say ... he told me that I was a little too shy. Since I have a series of infinite defects, but shy I am not, I considered it appropriate to restore the things and the truth of the issues a little, therefore I evidently decided to defend a right. It is therefore clear that the call I made had to stop the discussion, the discussion was interrupted only later, but I believe that what happened is in the documents and we will be able to discuss it later. On the merits, I believe that technically the colleague Sammaritani can best express the position of the League, which will obviously vote in the opposite way, but I also think that it is not because, I connect Minelli, I have vented before I am kept in a calm way: it is because it is precisely the anger escaped from some of your close colleague who persuaded me that perhaps the best weapon is this. The best weapon is precisely to highlight that exactly, as colleague Distort said, there are positions that are diametrically opposed within the majority and I thank you for your action, which makes them emerge in all their violence and in all their virulence, because I know that every initiative that is made, regardless of the justifications that are given, because obviously there is no one who intervenes with this violence and with this The one in which he believes ... what you wrote ... the person who is on your right, but would like to be on your left, because he would like to represent an even more extreme wing than you represent ... he would like to vote with every fiber of his body and, if he did not have these obligations of the majority, because obviously the things that told him to hold him on that place are two: one you do the commission president and, if you do not do the commission president and are not the fascists. Because this told him, this is what happened and this is what holds him down. I have a great passion for his resistance and stoicity, but above all a great respect for the great work that another colleague does, which has become a multiple vice president of different commissions, which must manage different commissions compared to his, and above all that he must try to contain and find a square when he speaks of topics that he obviously does not resist in voting or in expanding. With a good pulled of ears, here it reaches us ... either with a good pull of ears or with a good concertation it always manages to bring home the result. The result that is winning for him and for someone else not, but, fortunately, the accounts will be done in the end. I really thank you for bringing this motion and I hope, I really hope, that you will bring others."
47970,XVI,07/11/2024,"ORDINE PUBBLICO - FORZE ARMATE, Pubblica sicurezza, STATUTO",en,Sammaritani,Paolo,1959.0,M,LEGA VDA,50,6056,"I will try to intervene briefly, even for everyone's pity, and certainly without presumption to put an end to this discussion, interesting because, apart from the regulatory aspects, it involved issues that are both technical and clearly political. Evidently they are two different visions of how to manage a state and public safety in particular. Well, I have to say, I do it because I claim a certain intellectual honesty, which I am always adverse ... I never liked the urgent decreation and not even the laws made on the wave of emotion, therefore, when the penalties are tightened following a road accident, etc., I never liked, because I consider it anyway a run behind the events, which certainly does not be good for justice and even the management of the security and justice itself. Having made this premise, I must say that what has been said, for example, of the colleague Margurettaz, who is always sagacious in these interventions, is not entirely correct. In the sense that there are many other examples of cases in which there are crimes that already exist, conduct that are already clearly illegitimate and sanctioned by the penal code, but then they are more detailed because in a certain historical moment there are particular conditions, so there is a certain particular sensitivity towards certain conduct. I make an example for everyone: the 612-bis of the penal code, which precisely because it is called bis it means that it has been put later, in fact you all know it, red code, stalking, harassment. These crimes already existed, these conduct were already crimes, but certain aspects have been detailed because they wanted to protect women in particular, or in any case the people who are the subject of particularly serious conduct towards the life of relationship, social life. The same consideration applies to this ""security"" decree, it is evident. There have been rules that arise from a government that has taken a particular commitment regarding security and which is also a reaction evidently and giving satisfaction, in quotes, I say in a good sense, to those who voted for it, evidently, because perhaps those who ruled before had not done so. If you let certain things go, let a sense of insecurity pervades society, probably then you have to put some brakes. It may also be that you do too much, but for that you do not worry, on that other part there is the Constitutional Court, there are the magistrates, they do it, they will evaluate them. Many lawyers also contested this decree, then I am not looking at the political orientation, etc., because it is quite transversal, I must say, probably for the reasons I expressed before, order of the doctors, etc. Very well, there is no problem, the problems are solved in the courtrooms, the judges will be the constitutional court that will say: ""Here you have exaggerated, this is even unconstitutional"". Very well, we will take note, point and that's it, but this is the theme. The problem is that clearly this legislative provision, which is in progress, was of course the opportunity and what better opportunity for the left to shout to fascism, to repression, etc., etc., but this is in the game of the parties, we would miss it. The paradox, one of the paradoxes, because there is more than one, rather it is that precisely these things come from those who have never dealt with security, or they have occupied too little, and has regenerated that insecurity in the society which then asks for these answers. Collega Padovani, we do not need to go to the United States to be protected, we already do it here because, thank God, there is a government that we now consider ourselves protect us, first instead not. This is the fundamental theme. The other paradox is that precisely these criticisms towards this system to resolve things, that is, to exacerbate certain penalties and predict certain particular cases comes from who then, in reality, does the same things, but in a much more subtle way, because perhaps it does not have the courage to say: ""Look, I do a rule in which I prevent you from speaking or, better, if you talk about certain things, you are a scrangable being"". It does so in a much more subtle way because it implements a certain marginalization, a contempt for those who express different opinions. It also becomes quite paradoxical moreover the fact that one could think of going to dialogue with the No Tav with dialogue and listening, because I really know that we have the wrong approach. We have already seen it widely. On certain types of crimes I can even agree, on certain types of aggravating or rules I can even agree on the fact that perhaps they could also be excessive, but, as I say, it is not up to us to evaluate it. On other things, such as employment ... I make an example for everyone and then I close, the arbitrary occupation had already expressed the deficiency legislation. It must be remembered that within this article there is also talk of the emergency procedure for the release of the property. Here you really have to put the mutual interests on the scale, that is, it is more to protect those who occupy the accommodation or the owner who, poor, finds the accommodation occupied and does not know how to do it? This also happens here, as colleague Manfrin has already mentioned, it has already happened here that someone, even with public functions, in any case of protecting the public heritage, went to the Prosecutor to say: ""They occupied the housing, what do we do?"". And the prosecutor had to answer: ""I don't know what to do so much, we hope it goes away"". Do you understand? This is impotence. There it takes a regulatory intervention. To summarize, in fact, let's say that this type of measures are needed: they are needed because people want more security and therefore, if there have been some exaggeration, in fact, the organs deputted to clarify will think. We will clearly vote against this type of motion."

You are so off the road that, for once, the deputy that we elected two years ago two months ago has positioned each other and represented us unanimously. Colleagues, you are really out of the way.

Read what is written and retrace the stages that we have represented on some contents here. We have no problem to say that what we have written and what we think of that ""security"" decree is what we thought about the topics on which it goes to intervene from the first day we entered inside. There is no problem, from our point of view, no intention to put in difficulty who knows who. Everyone has his own conscience, everyone responds to the one in which he believes, does not believe, of the calculations he can do or not to do, of the fact of remaining consistent with his principles, his values, or not. Point. This is. Then there is the excerpt or having used another expression, patience, does not change the substance. We know very well that the bill can be completely changed from one chamber to another, or in part, there have already been the previous ones, that is not the problem, but if one believes that that measure is a measure that goes against the one in which he believes or what he is fighting, then votes, point.

Second maintenance law of the regional system for the year 2024 The vein is not to radically change the current legislative discipline and to make necessary changes aimed at improving the understanding of the text, better combining the various laws in force with the new regulations with which, in some way, they have a connection. As for the working method followed, each commission examined the articles of respective competence and, where it deemed it necessary, made the changes of the case. The II Commission, during the meeting on 28 October 2024, examined the articles: - 3, which bears provisions on the regime of the assets of the Valle d'Aosta Region of which the regional law 10 April 1997, n. 12, aimed at the updating and simplification of the alienation procedure of regional real estate. The goal is to reconcile the interest of the Region not to sell out their assets with that not to maintain, in its assets, assets no longer functional to the institutional purposes that involve deals of custody, safety and excessively high management; - 13, finally, containing the financial invariance clause. The II Commission, in the meeting on 28 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the aforementioned articles. The III Commission, during the meeting on 29 October 2024, examined: - Article 6, which inserts in the regional law of 18 January 2001, n. 5 (organization of regional civil protection activities), article 7bis, in order to promote informed and responsible behaviors by those who are on the regional territory, with reference to the presence of risk situations present on the same, as well as in relation to the frequentation of mountain environments, taking into account the characteristics, morphology and climatic variables of the territory itself. The novel intends to promote a culture of information and a greater sense of responsibility, which allow to prevent, or in any case limit, cases of people in danger and the accidents caused by unwary or negligent conduct, as increasingly detected by the Civil Protection; - Article 8, which bears a modification to the regional law of 20 November 2006, n. 26 (New provisions for the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads), in line with the provisions of the management of the safety of road infrastructures of Legislative Decree 15 March 2011, n. 35, in order to define the procedural aspects for the adoption of the discipline concerning the management of road safety along the road network of competence of the Region and local authorities; - Article 9, which bears provisions on agriculture. More in detail, paragraph 1 modifies article 18 of the regional law 3 August 2016, n. 17, which governs the aid intended for land improvement consortia, in order to guarantee greater clarity of the law, in order to contemplate the financing of all expected design charges. Paragraph 2 modifies paragraph 3 of article 23 of the regional law 21 December 2016, n. 24 (Regional Stability Law for the three-year period 2017-2019), which establishes the funding, in the form of anticipation, of some aid provided by the 2014/2020 rural development program in favor of the farms. Taking into account that some farms have yet to perceive in whole or in part the provision of aid by Agea, the proposed article provides for a further extension of one year, until 31 December 2025, from the deadline for the return of the advance obtained; - Article 11, which modifies paragraph 2 of article 3 of the regional law of 30 May 2022, n. 8 (provisions on the redevelopment interventions of the residential and public building assets), in order to specify, in implementation of the commitment assumed by the Region with the State, that the derogation, provided for by the modified article, to the general rule that sets the maximum duration of the fixed -term employment contracts of the public employees in 36 months concerns the employment contracts aimed at carrying out the interventions falling within the national recovery plan and resilience, as established by decree-law 9 January 2021, n. 80. The III Commission, in the meeting on 29 October 2024, expressed favorable opinion on the aforementioned articles. During the meeting on 31 October 2024, the IV Commission examined: - Article 4, containing amendments to the regional law 1 September 1997, n. 29 (rules on public transport services), in order to simplify the administrative authorization procedure, encourage the effectiveness of the administrative action through the reduction of unnecessary charges and obligations, reorder and simplify current legislation. The goal, in this case, is to encourage the protection of individual rights, limiting the constraints deemed not indispensable and thus making public transport more inclusive, granting all categories of people with disabilities the possibility of deciding with which type of medium to move; - Article 12, containing amendments to the regional law of 16 July 2024, n. 11 (Discipline of the organization of services to work and the system of professional training in the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta), bringing a series of interventions aimed at correcting and specifying the scope of the provision, also in implementation of the commitment assumed by the Region with the State, in line with the principle of loyal collaboration. During the meeting on 31 October 2024, the IV Commission expressed favorable opinion on the aforementioned articles. The fifth commission, during the meeting on 30 October 2024, examined: - Article 1, which bears amendments to article 9bis of the regional law of 17 March 1992, n. 8 (regional interventions in favor of a Foundation for the enhancement and dissemination of traditional musical heritage and for the development and diffusion of musical culture in the Aosta Valley), in the matter all this of regional tax for the right to university study for high artistic and musical training courses, in order to adapt the regional legislation to the discipline envisaged by the Legislative Decree 29 March 2012, n. 68, containing a review of the legislation of principle regarding the right to study which eliminates, in particular, the fixed definition of the amount of the regional tax for the right to university study; - Article 2, which bears amendments to the regional law of 19 July 1995, n. 25 (use of the canteen service by the inspection, board and teacher of schools of all levels dependent on the Region), regarding the use of the canteen service by the inspection, board and teacher of schools of all levels dependent on the Region, to better clarify their application scope by providing, among other things, the possibility, for the staff held to return, which can be afternoon or evening, service obligations, to take advantage of the canteen service to the maximum extent of one meal a day; - Article 5, which replaces paragraph 2 of article 39 of the regional law of 25 January 2000, n. 5 (Rules for the rationalization of the organization of the regional socio-health service and for the improvement of the quality and appropriateness of the health, socio-health and socio-assistance services produced and provided in the Region), in order to make it consistent with Article 7, does not provide for the approval of the program agreement with the USL of the Aosta Valley company following the modifications introduced by the regional law 11 February 2020, n. 3; - Article 10, which bears amendments to the regional law 31 July 2017, n. 11 (Provisions on specialist training of doctors, veterinarians and dentists and non -doctors of the health area, as well as university training for health professions). These proposed changes have the aim of limiting the regulatory constraint currently in force relating to the requirement of the residence on the regional territory for access to the financial interventions provided for by the law in question. To this end, the intervention provides that, in relation to the regional additional specialist training contracts aimed at doctors, additional specialist training posts with related scholarships aimed at graduates in veterinary medicine, dentistry and for non -medical graduates of the health area and the places reserved for the health professions, it is admitted, provided that the other requirements are respected, the access of the candidates who are not in possession of the residence requirement in the residence requirement. Valle d'Aosta. The fifth commission, in the meeting on 30 October 2024, expressed a favorable opinion on the articles mentioned above with the amendment to article 10 presented by the Councilor for Health, Health and Social Policies. The I Commission played the leading role of the bill and, in the meeting on November 4, 2024, examined article 7, which bears a modification to the regional law of 28 August 2001, n. 17 (Discipline of the functioning of the office of the civic defender. Repeal of the regional law of 2 March 1992 (institution of the civic defender), in implementation of the commitment assumed by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of loyal collaboration.

47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,5859,"Obviously, as a group, we will make an article evaluation by article of the provision, however I believe it is useful, indeed indispensable, to focus on an article that we have already discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the competent council commission, which is article 11. Article 11, which is included within this law, of this omnibus, which tends to bring results, the necessary, urgent changes, in short, a maintenance of the articulated. The question, to read this article, arises decidedly spontaneous and I hope that my intervention can serve as a starting point for reflection: what exactly this article is for? We read it in the report that is attached precisely in the articulated and the purpose of this article is: ""In order to specify, in implementation of the commitment assumed by the Region with the State, in application of the principle of real collaboration, that the derogation provided for by the modified article in the general rule, which sets the maximum duration of the fixed -term employment contracts of the 36 -month public employees, concerns the employment contracts aimed at the realization of the interventions referred to in Article 1, falling within the plan. national recovery and resilience "". In essence, it seems that, reading this article ... that without this intervention, the employees in question - we are talking about ARER -, therefore the ARER employees who deal with renovations, could not remain in service - who have been hired by the fixed -term project - beyond the date of December 31, 2026, or that they could not be extended beyond 36 months. In reality, the article that is modified recites precisely ... So this amendment here, article 11, is part of an existing law. What does this existing law say? In paragraph 2 he says: ""In order to ensure the recruitment of the personnel necessary for the functioning of the project structure referred to in paragraph 1, in times compatible with the start of the interventions referred to in Article 1, limited to the year 2022, the hiring of two units of two -term non -management staff is authorized, for a period of 36 months, extendable not beyond the date of 31 December 2026. To the discipline provided for by the regional regulation 12 February 2013 n. 1 - which are the provisions for access to the Single Divoria Valle d'Aosta -, without prejudice to the assessment of the knowledge of the French language pursuant to article 16 of the same regional regulation). Arer. What changes? Very simple: the decree-law 44/2023, converted into law 74/2023, in article 3, paragraph 5, amendment, with exclusive reference to the regions, autonomous provinces, metropolitan cities and municipalities, the discipline referred to in article 20 of the legislative decree 25 May 2017 n. 75, which - feel good - as a transitory basis allows public administrations the stabilization of staff already in service as a fixed -term employees at the same administration. The new rule allows this possibility to the aforementioned territorial until 31 December 2026. What happens then? The regions, provinces, municipalities and metropolitan cities, until 31 December 2026, can proceed, within the available limits of the current organic endowment, upon selective interview - we imagine somewhat selective -, and the outcome of the positive evaluation of the work activity carried out for the stabilization of the qualification covered with non -managerial people, who, within the aforementioned term, has accrued at least 36 months of service, even if not continuous, in the last 8 years at the administration to the hiring, which has been taken on a fixed term following competition procedures compliant with the principles referred to in Article 35, Legislative Decree 30 March, n. 165. Verbis Brevis or Brevis Verbis, the formula you prefer. Without this legislative modification, the staff who substantially say that the people who dealt with the Pinqua and 110% from ARR at the end of their service would have finished their service and of course, if they had then wanted to be absorbed by ARER, they would have had to make a competition. With this change it is simply said that the funds for the above projects are for the realization of the PNRR and are not funds for the Pinqua and for 110 and, on the basis of this, these people can be hired indefinitely. This necessity certainly does not come from the state, it is not that the state tells you: ""Listen, since you have to hire me two Aren employees, change this rule, so at least I stabilize them"".  I strongly doubt that the state worries, since you write that there is the principle of loyal collaboration with the state, of the hiring, of the stabilization of two ARER employees. We are therefore faced with a rule that has, as they say, nom and cognom and that does not change anything, it is a bit like turning the mattress from the winter side to the summer side, unless you are the mattress, then there the thing changes and actually, the mattresses are there and are two and they can be stabilized and hired indefinitely by the public administration with this modification, which does not change anything, it is not necessary. We, of course, ad hoc rules for mattresses we will not vote for it, if you do it ... we do a big good luck but we believe that evidently here has been made a rule of us call it pre-electoral."

I believe it is a concept that in other contexts, even European, is already very developed and that must enter a little in custom, in the mentality of those who carry out activities and that must consciously assume the responsibilities of the danger and any critical issues that can be there in confronting the territory, a concept of zero risk that does not exist and that is also part of this particular moment of climate change, even geomorphological, which characterize above all very particular territories Aosta Valley.

Two more words are spent because perhaps with this article we try to fill a legislative gap at national level, a gap that has led to a jurisprudence that is much discussed and sometimes I allow myself to say has brought jurisprudential distorts. It is clear that, by introducing this concept of self -responsibility, we allow each individual who faces the mountain, or of the ski courses, or other paths in the Aosta Valley also with the bicycle the freedom to independently determine his way of facing the path, to face the mountain, but which obviously imposes at the same time the full responsibility for what were the choices made. Doubts emerge when this person is accompanied by someone who has responsibility for accompanying. All this to say that it was an important step, but that perhaps the path is still long, so this article is welcome, but the invitation is, all together, to work on it still to take a further step forward and encourage those in the context - I see that the councilor who deals with the mountains - just about these skills has booked ... maybe our representatives in Rome can work perhaps in future legislative productions to go to clarify this aspect."

I illustrated an amendment proposed by the Aosta Valley in the hearing that took place in the Senate during the examination of the bill that deals with making the law on the 1994 mountain more modern. I must say that with the different interactions that we had both with the representatives of the Südtiroler Volkspartei, and in particular the Senator Durnwalder, but also obviously in connection with Senator Spelgatti, there was a work of the commission and then was a work of commission and Aula that has allowed to have, within the text already approved by the Senate, a legislation that concerns this issue that should also cover that part that cannot be covered by regional law, in particular criminal issues, which obviously cannot be subject to regional regulations. We are examining, even with colleagues who deal with the issues of the path and tourist impact, if it will be the case even better to specify the text of the articulated that has already been approved, which however is already a significant step forward. Now the law ends up in the Chamber, I will have the honor, as a representative for the mountain of all Italian regions and autonomous provinces, to be audited to the Chamber, and we will return to the point if the case. Already the current text is significant and in any case it must be appreciated, and I am pleased that she is, that in the meantime the region plays stakes within its legislation."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Cretier,Paolo,1963.0,M,FP-PD,16,3482,"Good morning everyone. In the meantime, a short declaration I would say on the meantime on this beautiful day that awaits us work in this beautiful week. The Omnibus contains a series of changes, additions or repeal made necessary to respond to the maintenance needs of the legislation in force, which requires retouches to improve some regulatory steps and its applicability. This is my thoughts. For example, article 6, in which the accompanying persons are responsible, or also ourselves, in particular in mountain environments, but by extended throughout the regional territory, thinking - and sometimes having the ability - to give up reaching a destination and the set goal. The renunciation saves life, our life, but also of those who have to intervene in extreme conditions. I quote an article read on a local weekly: ""Only the rescue of the Guardia di Finanza has rescued 48 people"" and I would also like to mention Hervé Barmasse for his declaration of renunciation in an interview in a climb in Nepal, who had to give up for obvious reasons, however, in a time, every now and then the decision must be taken and we must renounce. We are at the forefront of information, the civil protection system, very efficient that we have operational here in the valley, always is not enough, the foundation of article 6 is the self -responsibility codified by the civil code and in this case of the realization of others' interests without risking their lives or of those who accompany us and at the same time of the experiences expert, formed but operational in extreme conditions. Article 8, the classification, management, maintenance, control and protection of regional roads. The complicated reticulum of the somewhat dated regional roads physiologically requires ordinary and sometimes extraordinary maintenance interventions, with important financial interventions to ensure the practicability and safety of the citizen, the worker, the student and the tourist who climbs to the valley. Of course, it is also necessary to think about alternatives to avoid closure, the isolation of economic activities and give the possibility of returning, which are sometimes prevented from very dangerous calamities situations. Article 9, the theme of agriculture and the company connected to it. Timing times are now guaranteed by a regional complement that will be approved soon, today I hope. Sometimes the changes in data management create too many time hitches of pure reading of the data, of the value of the application, so it is necessary to extend to 31 December 2025 for those companies in difficulty. In cases of return of early sums, these companies - few for the real compared to the total - can have a breath of oxygen. Article 11, a derogation necessary to carry out the interventions falling within the PNRR, strengthening the administrative capabilities of public administrations, functional to the implementation of the same. These are just some examples that are connected to the III Commission of which I am a member and the mission are in particular agriculture, the health of the territory, public works and civil protection, linked directly to the aforementioned articles. As a group, we will vote for the bill for the necessary changes to openings and approvals to be made today. The progressive federalist group Democratic Party will certainly vote for this bill."
47985,XVI,20/11/2024,AMMINISTRAZIONE REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,18,844,"I simply want to thank the commissioner Sapinet for telling us that, for the stabilization of the two employees with the nom and cognom of arer, there was even a reserved correspondence between the Legislative Office and the Ministry to define the matter. You can try to make fun of someone, a few people for a long time or many people for a short time, you can't make fun of many people for a long time, so we will trivially see what will happen and if, how we predicted, there will be an indefinite intake of the two people in question, we will have evidently been right and we will take note of this. As a Lega group we have already expressed our approach, our thoughts on the vote of the articulated, evidently on the overall of the Omnibus law the Lega group will abstain."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,2,14022,"In reply to observations that have been brought in a way I would say a little broken within this morning of discussion, I know, in what were some observations, a little approximation in the topics covered and also a little poor punctuality and poor search for what was instead a very clear path, which wants to give answers, where they are useful, are possible, and are shared in their path, then more or less appreciated by those who must give the judgments. To be honest, however, I must say that the reconstruction developed by the colleague aggravation - made with a wealth of attention, of details - retraces the activities carried out during these months in a faithful way. I do not do it to annoy his colleague Baccega, who smiles at these statements of mine, but because intellectual honesty, in my opinion, always has to be underlined, even when not all situations have perhaps developed as they had planned. I believe that the important answers that are given within this change in the budget, which is a change in the budget which, for 95% of the financial resources questioned, corresponds to the needs resulting from the alluvial phenomenon that touched us on 29 and 30 June ... is a change of budget that leads to ratification all those variations, including for 21 million euros, which were activated immediately to give responses to the population, through the population, through the population. punctual built in the area, thanks to the activity of the regional structures and the activities carried out on site by the municipalities most touched by this phenomenon. Of those 21 million and broken that have been the subject of these budget variations that today we ratify - and that was a path foreseen within the rule that we approved a few months ago - these will be reimbursed, these already in an already conclaimed way by the national civil protection, for about 20.6 million euros. The other 35 million total that are made available are resources of which the availability is made by the regional administration and, for a part of these (in relation to the interventions mainly to be identified in the 13.8 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Cogne, 4.4 million euros in favor of the Municipality of Valtournenche and 500 thousand euros mainly made available to the other municipalities) a request to the national civil protection that has not yet has any type of cover and for which there is still no type of cover will still be brought certainty that they are referring to the regional administration. Therefore this is, if we want to say, a provision of resources that, where where they should be made in the account of the refreshments and reimbursements by the central administration to the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, will be reused and re -entered in new and future interventions; If this were not the case, the regional administration would find itself next year to implement those resources already assigned to local authorities to complete the works, to find further resources that will have to serve to complete the initiatives to support the functional recovery of all activities - from the road network to the technological networks touched - and will be the subject of the next financial programming and find this type of resources. This is a phase. The other phase is that of attention to the resources necessary to cover material damage. In this sense, an assessment that, in my opinion, has escaped to most, and is for what I appreciated, in some ways, the examination made by the minority colleague together with the illustration by colleague Malacrinò who promptly reported the resources intended, chapter by chapter, on this type of interventions. The 3,900,000 euros allocated in article 1, are substantially resources intended to refund the damage suffered, the material damages, by all the activities that have been involved in the alluvial management and which are, as already underlined in other circumstances, intended for law 5 (albeit perfectible, albeit dated in some ways, a little more cumbersome) that has even tried to streamline, accelerating the classic times of the classic times of the classic times of the classic times of the classic times End of the emergency, as set in a classic way, and accelerating the possibility of making requests for financing and requests for support for the damage suffered - with a procedure that provides for the definition, through the appraisals, through the necessary procedures and then go to the delivery - which will lead to a refreshment, where sufficient those resources, up to 70%. Where, on the other hand, in the face of a more important situation than these 3.9 million - and I also go to respond to some exceptions of the Forza Italia group - net of what will be the refreshments that will be assessed according to the resources made available by the state administration ... they will complete that band of attention that the regional administration must rightly have for those who have undergone important damage. On the other hand, the discourse of sharing is a speech where the intervention teacher lines on what had to be the attention to be placed to the structures, the activities, which had not had the opportunity to work, for the flood cause, in July, were available. The choice was prudent, fought and also shared and brought to the table of the associations, where there were different requests, but where it was considered (in a very transparent way, and also very serious, in my opinion) to share a path where these resources were made available for a relaunch of the activities from a point of view of liquidity. In some cases, the situations that had occurred could lead to refreshments - as we defined them - of a few thousand euros, which as a whole would not have moved the ranking of companies that perhaps have to plan the next winter activity, the next seasons and relaunch investments, and we have decided to support in an important way the possibility of self -financing, both to start again with the activity, and to create the conditions for having a functional liquidity to the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of the acquisition of stocks and so on. At the same time, and I fit into the article relating to the ski world cup, we believed that we must also include in this bill of the propulsive initiatives, of the initiatives that, starting from a critical situation, could give an envelope, a relaunch, to this ski resort: we did it by supporting, from a political point of view, the possibility of having the ski world cup in Cogne in January, and to support it with a Very pragmatic approach from the point of view of the use of financial resources, going to identify, as a beneficiary body of this contribution, the Municipality of Cogne, not so much to diminish the importance of a World Cup in Cogne or to make it estimated from the sports world, but precisely to make instead the need to intervene and plan a manifestation of this importance in a relatively short time, which is the one that is the one that is now in the end, of January. Other initiatives were then introduced on the sidelines of the natural disasters, which we all know well, and went to support the world of the company transversely, within which there is certainly a large part of the companies also touched by the flood, with support for the initiatives in favor of the confidi, going to implement - and it was underlined, and I thank those who did it - the goodness of this path that, in recent years, has seen a growth in the last two years, Interest rates for those who have been indebted and this reimbursement of the interests of the expenses incurred by our companies will thus be compensated almost overall compared to the law, which provides to reach up to 75% of reimbursement of the interest paid, and therefore 1,600,000 which brings to 4 and a half million euros the contribution in interest to the companies guaranteed by the confidi. And again, the possibility - as I said - to have particular attention to the territory through the consortia of land improvement in some situations that worry, from a point of view of urgency, for the areas concerned but also for the severity of those that may be the situations if you do not go to normalize and on which you do not go to intervene with a certain speed. To this, which is the universe of the initiatives that, overall, count about 55 million euros of resources made available for the flood, some cases have been added that are part, in a final part of the year, of those budget variations that are used to give the most urgent answers to the needs manifested by the structures and the territory, so that they can close those interventions that urgently shout that there has been a flood or not; Here we are talking about the chabod boarding school or the Pé-Saint-Didier swimming pool, where we can make comments and evaluations even of a wider order and on which we can or not agree, but that they need a closure of the circle and a deepening has been made, the councilor brought him to the attention of the council commission and I believe that this type of attention can then be partially exploited where I also want to do it. Punctual response to a territory that has not been served by a structure that has a very important specific weight for too long. I only within the merits, again, of an evaluation, which is that relating to the municipal secretaries. I, if I were those who have raised this request in recent months, I would find myself satisfied with the insertion of this clarification, let's call it that; It was debated from a technical point of view, the competent council commission had wanted and also audited the general secretary regarding an overall examination of the uncertainties that the secretaries agency had also shown regarding the new formulations and the situation had been clarified in some ways. I believe that this type of intervention gives greater interpretative guarantees and greater clarity - just as the opposition councilors required that over time had manifested this uncertainty - and I think it is also to be made to these stresses, to go to close a circle today. In this regard, I allow myself to anticipate what will also be the illustration, if we then want to do it in a more detailed way, of the amendment that we presented this morning and that goes, as shared in the board commission, to a principle with which we indicate a reserve, not so much to further complicate an article that has already been the subject of many variations in these weeks and in recent months, but to satisfy an intention - I seemed to have welcomed it in those terms - of the competent Commission and the competent Commission when there were two options on the plate and we had proposed, within the standard, a path that was - if we want - more respectful and relevant to those that were already ongoing national regulations, but with the idea, where shared by local authorities and by this classroom, to insert something more specific to the matured experience of the municipal secretaries in the last 5 years, and, in the case. worked more than three years within the municipalities, already acquiring a sort of familiarity in the activities to be carried out within our local authorities "". It is a path that, in my opinion, goes to clarify and also give answers about what can be the effectiveness of the secretaries (who are a focal point within our municipal administrations) and to give a 360 degree coverage of the needs to move forward with this call. I would stop here, thanking everyone for the discussion, thanking also for having to share the information, because in the sharing path that has been had in these months - net of doing it once a week, as someone said, or not - it is always very complex to be able to transmit, in a overall and complete way, every activity that is carried out in everyday life. We tried to do it in compliance with an assumed commitment, but to work for the good of the activities that were to be done, and which are still to be done now, in wanting to mean shared visions within the government, within the majority, and make them available as an information and as a reason for evaluation by the oppositions, which they wanted to show their opposition or their sharing on this type of initiative were able to do it. Today is the time to have any answers, to close a circle, and this is a proposal that seems to us very balanced, which goes to give three answers, one to those who have had damage (and there will be a certification of these, there will be a substantial coverage thanks to Law 5), one to the municipal administrations, and, indirectly, one to the companies and the communities that have been involved that will have the opportunity to work already, using the resources, using the resources. their provision to plan both the design part and that of the works that will evidently be carried out with the due times, and the activities of relaunching the activities in the area, through the World Ski World Cup but also through all those interventions dedicated to the territory with these 55 million made available mainly of the post flood but not forgetting the other things that, as I said, had to be brought more urgently than other topics."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,4,2834,"As we briefly summarized, already in the general discussion of the standard we have presented this agenda, because to date the much discussed article 5 provides for provisions that go to grant loans and not the refreshments and we know that this was one of the debated issues on which a choice had to be made. I believe that our vision and our will has already been highly highlighted and I have to tell her, president, that in his reply he made a passage that is a slightly cryptic passage and perhaps he will be able to clarify it, if he wants, because he said there was a discussion table with the associations and that there were different opinions. I did not understand if the discussion table with the associations, which reported different opinions, was precisely on the nature of the support that the Region had to provide to companies. This is why this agenda arrives, but above all this agenda highlights a theme that she has not dealt with - and of this I regret, and I hope that, before the end of the discussion and the vote, she will also have the opportunity to clarify it - that is, the question relating to the failure to audition the associations that we have indicated, because, objectively, it was raised a little by all the opposition colleagues, and I found it incomprehensible. She, if in her speech - I try to try to make a condensed, to extract something that can go in that direction - she veiledly wanted to say that there were actually different opinions on the nature of this support provided to companies, then you knew it and guilty you have avoided that the companies would come to tell us what they thought, because you did not want to leave the documents, in the verbal, a other, more critical. The phrase with which the request for audition was liquidated, that is ""are not relevant to the law""; This is an objectively embarrassing thing, so it is clear that it is not acceptable. However, coming to the commitment and the agenda, as we have highlighted and as we have reported, with this agenda it is asked - and even more so if you say that there is the possibility that the funds that have been covered, in advance of the potential supports and supports by the national part ... - If there is therefore a coverage of these funds, if the resources with which a measure can then be established. All the more reason, with this agenda we ask and undertake the regional government to prepare a measure, with relative financial coverage, which recognizes the adequate refreshments to companies and economic operators affected by the alluvial events of 29 and 30 June."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,6,4126,"I gladly respond to this umpteenth solicitation by colleague Manfrin, because there are topics where the colleague is very prepared, others where his interventions are a little more incomplete. First of all, I allow myself to underline how within the comparison that was there - and it seems to me that it has always participated - perhaps it is also my fault, that I have not expressed myself in the best way, but they were underlined and made available, also of the colleagues, of the assessments that derived from a comparison mainly with Adava, which was the most active interlocutor in this course during these months. The options that had been underlined and had been brought to the table, to whom she was also sitting, gave two types of opportunities: one to intervene with the refreshments, as classically understood, with a percentage of compensation around 20% compared to the failure to make inclaimed rates, which had been identified, wide, about 4 million, which would have brought it - and I mentioned it within my replica - to some in some cases they would have contributed in some case. Important way and in some cases for a few thousand euros) for many companies that had had revenues lower than 40% compared to the average of previous years. Everything still to be certified, all to put in line and all to put in a context that took into account from a part of what could be the limitations dictated by the aid of state, on the other of the actual reports and the bureaucracy that had to be developed in order to be able to reach these refunds. The evaluation that had been proposed, and was proposed at the table, to which no one then said neither yes nor no, rightly, because then it becomes easier perhaps to go to criticize a choice that must somehow be made and say: ""No, but I preferred the other"" ... Meanwhile, in the meantime we put one on the table and think of doing it in the best way to give answers, therefore we have evaluated to meet a choice that could be more coherent and more positive. suffered damage and for those who needed to relaunch their business, going to support them with an amount (in some ways even higher than the individual reimbursements would have been) which, however, could have given to all companies the opportunity to supply themselves in an appropriate way to relaunch their season, to relaunch their work over time, providing most of the resources for a renovation of the services that are part of the possibility of hosting new people, Initiatives such as the World Cup to relaunch the territory. I still want to emphasize the commitment that there was by the competent councilor in a negotiation - I call it this way - in a very close confrontation also with the competent ministry, of which we will then talk in the second of the two proposals of the agenda, where the councilor and the Piedmontese councilor evaluated to be able to insert, where possible to do so, also of the refreshments in addition to the reimbursements for the material damage suffered, because in the Piedmontese territory, They were, so we collaborated to find a path that could also give the two opportunities to our territory, and I think - net that someone is not happy and that it would perhaps have preferred something different - we did a careful job and with the desire to give the answer that we believe best for this type of interventions. We did it in concert and also comparing ourselves with the associations during the course, as we had anticipated to her too; On this aspect I think that the availability, also from Finaosta, to make available a product that can be appreciated, very slender and very quick to set up and to be activated in favor of those who need it is an important example. As for your agenda, we will abstain for the reasons we have expressed."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,8,5334,"Thank you, president, for your courteous reply, I also thank you for your judgment on my skills, I appreciate it in a particular way, I am sure that instead she, accustomed to covering all the roles a little, has developed exceptional understanding of understanding on all the themes of human knowledge and gives it daily, and we thank this for this and we thank the providence of having placed it in that position. D'Aosta, on the other hand, we certainly have a person who is of everything in the right place, at the right time, and we thank this for this. Net of this, she was very skilled to say something of this type: the choice is this because as it was conceived, that is, as you had thought of it, therefore the percentage of non -collection, the percentage of refreshment, what it entered, what was given, that is, the model that you had made you did not be fine, and since the model of refreshments that you were made. President, but it doesn't work like this, it doesn't work like this at all! There are two roads, at least we said it and she admitted it too: there is the road that you have taken of you, and we will see - we have expressed an opinion - we will see how many people will use these loans, especially since, as we have also underlined in the text, the winter season has already started and these loans still the possibility of adherence is not there, so we will see how much will be able to see you, The pull on the measure, especially for those who have been particularly in difficulty, because I put myself in the role of a structure that has had damage and clearly face you and has no liquidity to do it, take loans that will then have to return and therefore worsen its hole. This is a mode that we will check. He said, however, and I am happy, that there are two roads: there is the road to the loans you have taken, on which I also want to reiterate that it is not that we were placed in the meetings the opportunity to choose, because we said it, we were simply informed, we got there and we were said: ""We thought about this, we thought of doing this other, things are so, what are the things so, what"" do not want to take? That it is so? ""We asked for it even several times, if it will remember:"" To this proposal, to this article, there are alternatives? "" It is not the fact that I was sitting at the table and to be informed of what happened that makes us somehow complicit; We took note of it and we told him clearly, I think transparency is absolutely impeccable on our part. She said that she responded with pleasure but in reality she did not answer, or rather, she replied how she is usual, in her omniscience, that is, not saying: ""Eh, yes, we prevented the debate because we were afraid that someone came to the Commission to say: we do not want this measure, we do not want this proposal"", it would have been more honest instead of giving mandate to the president of the II Commission to dry out, it would have been more honest. ""We don't want criticism, we know everything, we have science infused, we don't want criticism."" But no, but as it usually does, she says in her answer that ""net of someone's failure to satisfy"", so one could read that someone is not satisfied, but this ""someone"" to what percentage of the sum activities? Because she talked mainly of Adava, but we have listed two other categories, Confcommercio and Confesercenti. Was these categories asked what they thought about it? Because we did it, we asked him, and these categories did not even see the text. We simply are not that we wanted to have a part of part from one part to the other, someone preferred to say: ""Do you know that there is? No, we don't make the auditions because"" it is so and it is so ""and they are not relevant to the law"". We take note, we will obviously communicate to companies and trade associations that are no longer companies, they must not be defined as so, because the article that establishes this possibility obviously does not include them. I will tell her the truth, for a moment an idea had come, that is, to present an amendment that removed the word ""businesses"" from the article, because so much is not relevant and therefore it was fine. It would have been the provocation and perhaps he would have added something to the debate, but we believe that this is in itself evident, in reality, even in his response. It is therefore evident that you have made a choice, we legitimately propose another one, then we will vote as you do in democracy and we will see the result at the end and everyone, inside and outside this classroom, will be able to know how one thinks and how the other thinks in a democratic way. It would have been more cute to also have people's ideas, but you are a bit allergic to criticism. Okay, in agreement, we will see how many you will collect from here at the end of the legislature."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Marquis,Pierluigi,1964.0,M,FI,10,7267,"We also illustrate, as a group of Forza Italia, the agenda that we presented in the field of refreshments following the damage suffered by the flood of 29 and 30 June last. Basically it is a re-proposal of the agenda that we have presented in the context of the discussion of the Defr 2025-2027, in relation to the support of the economic operators who are not affected by the refreshment provided for by the State. We believe that, with a view to collaboration between the State and the Region, it is necessary to deal with the theme in the context of complementarity of action and at the supplementary level, as it is done by the Region in many situations, I refer, for example, to what we have already seen in the past in the context of the initiatives of the world of work, of training, where the state makes available to the funds on one sector and the Region makes available on the other, to give complete coverage to the needs that are in the area. In this case, the constructive collaboration relationship with the central center -right government that proven, in this circumstance and in others, to have a great consideration of our region to be highlighted. I would like to start, in the introduction, from the first inspection that was in Aosta, the meeting of 2 July, with the Minister of Tourism, where the availability of economic operators was announced, which are the responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism, of a series of aid to support refreshment: 10 million had been announced, today 15 million have been decreed together with Piedmont but I believe that the word given was maintained, with the decree that was approved on 11 November. After that there was the inspection in the valley and the great attention that was shown by the Minister of Public Administration and by the Minister of Civil Protection that came to account: the Ministry of Civil Protection made available, following the decree of the state of emergency, 20.6 million euros to cope with the difficulties. The Region did its part and I believe that with satisfaction the opening of the road was recorded after 27 days of insulation, an important job was done to which all the regional structures have made their contribution. From the point of view of the approach that was there at this change in the budget, we had said in illustration in the intervention of the general discussion, my colleague repeated it that intervened after me, that we would have shared the articles from 1 to 7 and instead, as regards the attitude on the overall vote of the provision, it would also have been in consideration of what would have been the behavior on this agenda by the regional government. We have not made any confusion, we are very clear and we believe that the Region, for our way of seeing and giving solution to this problem, should intervene to complete what the state has done, as part of the activities that are excluded from the benefits that are financed by the Ministry of the Interior, because in these days we have also seen in the press that someone says that it is a pity that the bars are not included, so it means that they were a need, because the state had made available to the state. They would have been useful for these categories, not as it is said now that perhaps there was no need, because someone may come to him1.000 euros rather than 1,500, rather than 500 euros and that it is an evaluation of an insignificant benefit. For us it is significant, so we believe that it would have been correct that all economic operators could have had the same approach by the public administration, but an supplementary approach of what the state has set up, because we cannot always think of delegating everything to the state, we also have responsibilities of management and therefore I believe that, as in a family, everyone should do his part: everyone makes available what he can put in the moment to face the situation of difficulty. I believe that the allocation we received from the state is important but if the state has provided in the context of the categories included by the Ministry of Tourism, I believe that we would have been up to us to see what the excluded categories are and intervene in the same way on that type of activity. This is what we ask with this agenda, nothing more; It seems very simple but also very reasonable as a proposal. We cannot understand the reason, the ratio for which it cannot be accepted. Among other things, it seems to me that on the question of the refreshment of indirect damages, the categories have claimed it and have requested it, therefore either the categories do not also have the clear situation of the situation, or there is something that does not square in the approach. The measure of article 5 we will support it, but it is a completely different measure, which gives a response not to the need for refreshment, gives the opportunity to open mortgages, but they are two completely distinct things. We will vote for article 5, but we ask to be able to go in this direction. To the colleagues of the opposition who said that perhaps this is the presentation of the agenda, it was also the opportunity to clarify to eliminate their confusion, in the sense of approaching this initiative; I say that perhaps it is we who have some confusion lately because we no longer know what the locations are in this classroom. We take it more and more and it would be important to understand what are the real locations from here to the budget because we will not face a partial subject like this, but we will have to manage, in a dozen or fifteen days, the budget of the Valle d'Aosta region. Our spirit is a very clear spirit, everyone knows what our location is, a location of Forza Italia Centrale in the center -right, we do not understand what the self -refinerations are geometrically placed somewhere. We believe that the Center corresponds to a non -geographical representation, but of values, so we wait for the evolutions that must be there, but we believe to send back to the sender of the observations that are purely instrumental and that also try to feed political weeds within the center -right. The center -right is a project, which is at an advanced stage because it is working together, it is nice that the League also had a maturation path because at the time of the Defr the initiative that we had presented on the refreshments had not been supported, today instead it shared this spirit, so we will no longer be only we of Forza Italia to represent this need of the Avalthian but the sharing number will grow in the classroom. For our part, the construction site is an advanced construction site, it is not a construction site still under planning or design, therefore, to those who allow themselves to make assessments within the house of others, we wish to have the same success, to be able to put together the energies and the forces that presupposes to be able to put together."

I will reply in a very simple way. Perhaps, animated by this political positioning, some aspects have been lost on the Legislative Decree Which instead had to be analyzed in a slightly more in -depth way, as other colleagues did and tried to bring back to the classroom. The first article, which is an article that goes to finance Law 5, is an article that will guarantee the refreshments to those who have had damage in the area. The procedure of law 5, the 3,900,000 euros of resources; It seems to me that in article 1 we go to finance what will be the requests that have been made, however without the indication of an ateco code or anything else, because law 5 does not provide for this type of development. Precisely with the perspective of what she says, these resources are made available to cover companies that will not be touched by the national decree, since, only to add an element, those who adhere to the national contribution must not have other subsidies, by other bodies or other public resources, to complete. It goes alone that the answer to his question is already within the Legislative Decree, that is, those resources there - which are not enough or there are too many and that they will be remodeled, increased, evaluated in a possible future bill ... - are already present and are there on purpose to give a repayment of up to 70% for those companies that have had material damage; Those that will clearly be excluded and will not be contemplated within the national path that provides for 15 million reimbursements for the material damage suffered (therefore all those situations that will need to be reimbursed for the interventions they have had to do) will find an answer within Law 5 with this first allocation which, if it is not enough, will be implemented, but which will guarantee a reimbursement to 70%. This is the path that had already been adopted in 2000 with the flood, which gave a coverage to the damage transversely had in the area and that, even in this circumstance, with speeding up, if we want, also of the law, because the law of his - I said it before but perhaps it has escaped - should see, before being able to draw up the beneficiaries, the closure of the emergency path, which in this case is by means of the resources. made available by the State, will see the formalization of those who can access the regional benefits; They are resources already available immediately and they will be made available to those people who will not have had refers nationally. From this point of view, therefore, I feel authorized to say that the availability is already there and is already conclaimed within this bill."

It's very simple, she tells us something to divert the reasoning. The discussion is only and exclusively on indirect damage that are called missed profits, because material damage is one thing and in article 1 there is no indirect damage. Then I am telling you that there is an unfair behavior on the part of the public administration in relations with economic operators, because there are economic operators who will have compensation of refreshments on direct and indirect damage and there are economic operators who, because the region does not put the money on indirect damage, will have only the recognition of direct damage. We must not be able to make fun of us, because this is the truth, because equivocal on this means making fun of itself, because the agenda, to tell him very clearly, has this objective, to recognize the indirect damage, the one that the associations that you did not want to give answers ask for. Everything else is a fuck."
47987,XVI,20/11/2024,BILANCIO E CONTABILITA' REGIONALE,en,Grosjacques,Giulio,1962.0,M,UV,16,7037,"With reference to the agenda, if colleague Marquis agrees, I would also enter a little more in detail of the question time, given that the premises are exactly superimposable, therefore given the restricted time for the question time, perhaps we deepen a little more the path that led to the issue of the decree of the Ministry of Tourism. Meanwhile, in the introduction, you will not lead us to say that the Ministry and the Government did not do their part, also because I wish to thank the structures of the Ministry for what they did and above all for the interlocutions we had, that they were continuous and constant; However, I believe that it is important to summarize some steps, because she concludes the agenda by saying that she prepares a refreshment measure to cover the atheist codes not of competence of the ministry. Then I will come, making the excursus, to tell her that those who were kept outside were not kept outside because not of competence of the Ministry, but were kept out for a choice linked to resources, as stated by the general manager. In your questions, she asks if the perimeter of the atheco codes of the decree was known. We started our interlocutions, starting from the next day of the visit of Minister Santanchè of 2 July; The minister (and this is good to underline it, even if the president has already made a passage on this) after the commitment of the 10 million - which then became 10 for two regions and then became 15 for the interlocutions between the Valle d'Aosta region and the Piedmont Region and the Minister himself - had categorically excluded the refreshments for non -profits. The decree should have concerned only the material damage only and exclusively and this emerges from a whole series of correspondences between the structures of the Department and the Ministry. The Ministry, after the video conference of 10 September, where the issues related to the contents of the decree were deepened, had sent a list of atheco codes to identify the economic activities to which ministerial resources could be destined. In this email, for example, the other sporting activities were included: on our express request we had reported some structures and infrastructures, primarily the Golf of the Breuil, which had been seriously damaged by the flood and which in the email by the ministry were first replied. We had not found the Ateco code 56.30 which concerned the bars and we have, as for other categories, written on several occasions asking to include these categories also because they had been damaged, and they are not outside the competence, because outside the competence of the Ministry of Tourism there were the commercial activities on which we did a job that did not lead to the same results, unfortunately, with the Ministry of Companies of the Made in Italy. The Ministry had, contrary to the first drafting, also a series of activities expressly requested by us, such as the rental of sports equipment, which we know that in Breuil Cervinia have suffered several huge damage, and ski schools; The decree was not subjected to us because - the explanation, I believe legitimate, of the ministry was this - since it had been sent to the Ministry of Economy and to the Court of Auditors for the visa of competence, could have undergone the findings that would subsequently give rise to changes - therefore the draft of the decree the Region never saw it, except after its definitive publication on 11 November, as she remembered. As regards the nature of the compensation, in the videoconference made on October 16 in the presence of the minister and councilor Chiarelli (my approval, for the Piedmont Region), the minister expressly asked to allow the attribution of resources for the refreshments for the non -profits, since the municipalities included in the civil protection order of the Piedmont Region would have practically had any type of refreshment as they had not occurred, situations, material damage. We therefore agreed and given our consent so that the minister could, on the basis of the agreement between the two regions, followed by the signing and subsequent publication of the decree. As regards the competence of the Ministry's subjects, evaluations were made here by saying: ""You asked for things that were not the responsibility""; It is not true, because, if she read - as I imagine that she has done - carefully the atheco codes, she found the canteens or street pastry shops or in any case the restaurants, therefore catering activities, activities that are usually managed by the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy, therefore this decree could have safely included bars. I say this because in the videoconference of 15 November, therefore last Friday, in the presence - I want to underline it - of all the entrepreneurial categories included in the decree, the general manager of the Ministry's production activities, to express demand - and I add that at the request of the Ministry the videoconference that lasted an hour and a half has been recorded, therefore through its channels it will certainly be able to obtain it - he said that the bars were excluded for a ministerial choice. So I believe that from this point of view all the work that was to be done was done. The merchants were absolutely taken into consideration, because the undersigned had more interlocations with the head of cabinet of Minister Urso, but the only measure available to the Ministry of Companies was that linked to the demolition of rates for those who wanted a measure similar to the one that was set up in the budget variation: the central mediocredit would have shot down the rates, but there was no type of refreshment provided by the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy. This is to say that we also followed those who knew that they would be excluded from this decree. I close because I no longer have time but I would like to say, colleague, that you have highlighted a whole series of steps, but it seems to me that your business, despite being national forces at national level, is a bit to chase the things that have already come out instead of having - and you have it - the possibility of interning, because I have heard of her on several occasions that she has telephone contacts with all the ministers of this government, so she said it on several occasions, I want to emphasize is that you could have been heavily intervened on this decree, instead we did everything that had to be done and feel today by national government forces that the decree is lacking and above all to be told that there are activities that have not been included ..."

Councilor, I carefully listened to his reconstruction, we are pleased that you have kept continuous relationships with the competent ministry. From what it appears to us, everything possible on the part of the Ministry has been done to be able to make the audience of the beneficiaries as wide as possible, so we appear to be a different thing compared to what you have announced, that is, that according to her, it could extend the benefit to some types that are excluded within the category of economic operators; As far as we are concerned, we believe we are satisfied with the work that has been done centrally, we recognize it, we were pleased that she also recognized it that there was a good collaboration, but it is precisely for this reason that we thought and we believe, as I said just a few, that, as part of a collaboration between bodies, between different institutional levels, when an approach is established are integrated and to make the measures complementary at our regional level. This is sorry that it has not been done and we are sorry that it does not want to be taken into consideration.

A few pieces were probably lost when, in the discussion on the Defr, all the opposition groups recalled that it was a little agreed to wait for the articulated, then to be able to examine the articulated, and then be able to formulate their positioning. So we did, as we agreed, we waited to see what the articulated was and obviously I will not hide the surprise of having seen the articulated that should have been the emergency one loaded with a whole series of articles concerning the world universe; So in something that we expected exclusively dedicated to the flood, on the other hand, it is loaded with everything a little, but once given what was expected and once examined also and listened to the opinion of the bearers, which we had highlighted we would have had the pleasure of auditing in the commission, but there was no possible by virtue of the censorship applied by the President of the II Commission obviously of the President of the Region, therefore in the face of this censorship, Rather clear, but we had a confirmation.

I think that the debate we have heard was useful, however partial information is certainly not partial, is not at the level of the commissioner or the colleague Marquis, therefore in the spirit, as we wanted to support the agenda of the colleagues of the League, we will also vote for this agenda. However, I want to make a clarification: I know that colleague Marquis is much more iron in geometry than me, but politics is often algebra and is not geometry. What I said this morning ... indeed, I also thank the colleague Baccega for awarded me for a title that I am not worthy, but I thank him anyway, I tend to make a very simple consideration: I did not say that you had a confusion and I did not even say that the center -right has a confusion, I said that I was the confused one, because finding two orders of the day, however with a non -trivial peculiarity, because I must say the truth, The agenda of the League's colleagues keeps the shirts of any possible application open to insert those who have forgotten, she makes two steps that, in my opinion, have generated confusion. On the one hand, basically, he asks to intervene where - and, I repeat, I give reason to the commissioner Grosjacques - the Ministry, or in any case the government that you support at the Roman level, did not intervene and therefore I say to me: ""Why do not make an operation from your part of Moral Suasion to try to find not so much the theme of money but the ways to be able to intervene anyway?"", Because the choice is mainly depends on Aosta; On the other hand, I objectively expected only one agenda, since however this choice was made here, because - I connect to what colleague Manfrin said - in the previous location I remember very well that under the Defr, rightly, all the opposition forces, without the need to connect them with red, blue or green threads, had remained substantially a little through your agenda, for a reason: Of intent, and we know that the term communion is complex, because everyone has to agree, and we found ourselves a little displaced. Here therefore - it is my confusion, I repeat, you will surely have clear ideas - like a battleship you go to Dardanelli and I am happy for you, but the confusion was mine, because if I had to choose who to support, in the end I have to understand if they say the same thing, if they say two different things. Support is a support on the principle, on the will, even on the effort, but objectively, from what I felt by the councilor, the demanding is perhaps not entirely ... or in any case what happened, or rather, even some premises, perhaps it is not entirely consistent with the path, however, I repeat, we have certainly partial information, so it is you who must then give an explanation of what happened, and the ""you"" say it. I did not give confusion to others, I was the confused one, because finding these orders of the day, rightly one says: ""let me understand what the position is"", considering that à maintes reprises, as I said, is said that you are united for better or for worse, and nobody wants to divide you, for heaven's sake, already do enough alone in some things. Having said that, I repeat, in the beginning we vote for it even if, in the face of what we have heard, there are many doubts."

I also make some considerations in the light of the President's reply, because when it highlights that I agree or to have appreciated the report of the councilor aggravation ... I would like to highlight that in that report there are all the sharing points that have been expressed by all the other group leaders, therefore a lack of sharing the provision, the auditions denied in the Commission, the resources covered by national funds, the insertion of articles that had no relevance to the Secretaries, the same councilor also redone himself to the considerations that I brought during the general discussion to say that he shared what I said in full. Also this time I do not understand if it is linked to the way the various thoughts are displayed or if it is linked to the variable geometries that we feel so much about in these days. Honestly, from this point of view, as has been announced by the president, surely the document that we will vote in the next regional council will perhaps also define the picture, but I repeat that I will see what what has been said, but having also shared with his colleague his minority relationship, I can say that in some way I have shared his and he shared mine, because the things we said are the same. As I said, it is a shame, you could have a unanimous vote, most likely on those articles concerning the emergency. So we didn't want to do and therefore we will abstain."

From these interlocutions were born some observations that we had the opportunity to present to the III council commission, audited by President Charrian in III Commission on December 19, 2023 and after this hearing, we proceeded with notification no. 4 to the European Commission. This notification was then approved by the European Community with its own decision on September 30, 2024 and therefore today we find ourselves having to ratify the modification of this CSR based on the interlocutions that we have already had throughout the year. In addition, compared to the changes that we agreed and on which we compared in December with the council commission, we have a reduction of 1% of the Feasr share - established in accordance with the Ministry, to go to give a response of solidarity with respect to the alluvial events that have insisted insistently especially the agricultural sector in Emilia Romagna - and an increase in the prizes on the organic 10 euros on the meadows and 5 euros to also include certification. This was a request that the trade associations and the representatives had made: ""Including in costs also precisely the certification costs""; Through all the interlocutions, it was decided to raise the shares of these euros (precisely to give this type of response) and to go, in fact, to include certification costs."

It is the new reference of the common agricultural policy, a complex of rules in support of the agricultural and forestry sectors for rural areas, is the founding reference in Italy to the national strategic plan, shared with all regions, the resources are about 92 million for us for us, with state-region and fesr shares. It contains all forms of support, in particular those related to disadvantaged areas, to compensatory payment for the agricultural areas Natura 2000 and for animal welfare, very important and necessary for us compared to other realities of the Po Valley. With today's approval, real support for the agricultural world is implemented - certainly not of simple application, we are clearly convinced of it - but which requires a temporal application effort that needs to understand the system and changes to the management of companies, changes that are not always immediate and adaptable, but these new formulas indicate new roads for production and less impactful management, with choices aimed at organic, in particular with the productions forage. A great work was carried out by the trade association, by freelancers, the offices of the Department and the VDA area, to make companies adopt the binding changes thinking of the new agricultural production and management systems. We had a time on our side privileged environmental conditions and today, year by year, we must know how to grasp the changes and constantly model the entrepreneurial management of the climate and the trend of the market, not only local. The future hope for the sector is a conscious adhesion, already started with the knowledge of the detailed, but not impossible conditions; They are opportunities proposed as in the past, with constant and punctual payments, hoping that the Aosta Valley will always be among the first places and, if not to the first, as happened in the past, for the progress of the expenditure of regular and punctual payments, with the collection of measures, hope is for everyone by the end of the year. For companies, which have earned it, a Christmas gratification, not indifferent to the payments of rents, staff and mortgages with expiring installments. In addition, it is worth remembering once again the commitment carried out by the primary actors, Department of Department, with its structures and offices, the area and the Agea, the trade associations, the cooperative system and, finally, the individual owners of the company or entrepreneurs, ready and aware in grasping the complement opportunities today to be approved.

I want to clarify that behind the word ""agriculture"", we must not forget all the entire territory, because today we have a document here and I hope that it has taken note of all the meetings that have been made in the area, as the councilor Carrel mentioned; I had participated not everyone but in some of these meetings where all the problems and all those peculiarities had been underlined that perhaps do not have an entrepreneurial spirit but have a very important aspect as regards the maintenance of the territory. I hope that with this document we will meet all these requests that have been carried out by the territory. We, as a group of Rassemine Valdôtains, had, reluctantly, were abstained last March for the approval of this document, because in our opinion it did not give concrete responses especially for these small realities, for many small realities that today maintain the territory without taking into account the economic aspect, but only for pure maintenance and tradition of the territory, with the aim of having a panorama not only agricultural, but also for the tourist aspect, which gives an impression. Because, like all of us, we know, having a well -kept territory is also very important for the tourist aspect, and I don't need to underline it. What can I say? We really learn and hope with a good omen, that this document gives an answer to the territory, to small realities and so on. As we abstained with the other document, we will abstain, but we will work in a constructive way to be able to give major resources in all senses, to be able to have a document and give answers to the territory that truly go to see those small realities that today many times are forgotten, but that give a very important contribution for the maintenance of the territory, to combat fires, floods and anything else that unfortunately today are very important, they are very important, they are very important. They are basic- perhaps, with a territory like ours, when it comes to agriculture, they do not go to affect enough regarding the aspects of our territory. I hope that with Law 17 and with other measures we will intervene in favor of these to make it give more detailed and more targeted answers to all these particularities, so that they continue to maintain our territory as has always been maintained, as we have inherited it by our ancestors."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,16752,"This proposed bill deals with urgent measures to counter the depopulation of small mountain municipalities. The Aosta Valley is considered a mountain region in full; On the maps that we study at school the mountain percentage is 100%. This aspect, if we are objective, and above all grown up compared to when we went to school, we do not consider it truthful, or at least not in full. There are municipalities, or in any case parts of them, that calling them Montani is a real insult for those who really know what the mountain is and lives it all year round. We must be primarily, therefore, to stop calling ourselves entirely mountains if we want to give justice to those who really live there in the mountains. The depopulation touches almost all in the Aosta Valley, except the municipalities of the Plaine, in which instead there is a general increase in the population. But the difference, and this is the sense of the law, is that the depopulation that touches the small municipalities puts at risk the existence of the same. Losing 100 people in Châtillon is certainly serious, to miss 10 in Rhêmes-Notre-Dame is much more. It goes of social, economic life, it goes of volunteering - just think of the Pro loco, the volunteer firefighters, the Alpine troops - and they go about politics, now we always see the usual people who apply, provided that precisely these people are still located. And on this I precisely want to emphasize: Municipalities that to date no longer have a sufficient critical mass of the population to guarantee a life of the community are municipalities intended to have a future, are they intended for death, why is this that it is, and how can a young man also invest in a municipality that does not have a future? Often the mistake of looking at the increase and decrease of the population in the last ten years is made, of course, these data must be taken into account, but above all the trend must be analyzed in recent decades. Èmile Chanoux already in the 1920s said: ""Je suis originaire of a Pays de la Vallée d'Aoste Où le dépeuplection fait le plus de ravages. J'ai can see the épouvantable sadness de ce pays de vieux"". It is in fact starting from the unification of Italy that the depopulation of many of our small municipalities and many high hamlets of large municipalities has begun, the data of the various censuses demonstrate it and these are easily available on the Istat website. If we analyze this trend in recent decades, the numbers are merciless, we take some examples, in fact, starting from the unification of Italy. In 1861 Allein had 770 inhabitants, now 207; Chamis 322, now 107; Emarèse 495, now 217; Etroubles 1.032, now 478; La Magdeleine 386, now 100; Pontboset 708, now 174; Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 777, now 164; Valsavarenc 639, now 161. There are only some examples. A phenomenon, as I said, that has distant roots; Not simple solutions, but those proposed in the law could be some of these. In fact, this proposal faces one of the aspects that could reverse the phenomenon of depopulation: the fact that living in the mountains more costs and therefore contributions are needed, and above all the decision. A proposal that has never claimed to be decisive of the problem, but a proposal that must be, together with others, one of the pieces of the puzzle, a proposal that can allow those who live in the mountains to stay there and those who want to return. Someone could argue that more than facilitations for natural persons, families, it is necessary to guarantee services - and I totally agree - but guaranteeing the services must go hand in hand together with the economic aid aimed at families and to those who want to invest in these small territories. Without people, services cannot be guaranteed, without services the presence of people cannot be guaranteed. These two themes must go hand in hand. The current results of the depopulation demonstrate two aspects: either that the measures adopted to date are not sufficient or that these measures are wrong, because otherwise we would not be here to talk about a law against depopulation. At the center of this proposal there is also the cultural aspect, an urban and urbanized valley of Aosta is in fact a valley of Aosta in which autonomy no longer makes sense, because this land would become, like many other territories, without specificity; A valley of urban and urbanized Aosta is a ""Italian Aosta Valley in all"" and on this one must in any way resist, in the name of those who wanted the specificities we enjoy today. And here is the linguistic, cultural aspect, of symbiosis with the high lands to be sent back: in fact, for those who decide to return to live in the mountain municipalities, the need to attend a francoprovoral language and culture course, Titsch and Töitschu and Walser culture in the Walser municipalities, as well as a communication campaign of the measures of the law in the French states and in the German states for the communities, is expected to live to live in mountain municipalities. Walser, because the goal would be to attract new inhabitants from other states, with the aim of changing life. And, if you notice, in the financial coverage of article 4, for the contribution for the new residents, the Chéque Montagnard, the amount is absolutely prudential and in perspective, as it is really a life choice that requires time in the decision. A real, concrete, improveable proposal, as I said from the first day. A non -trivial articulated that I will now deepen. Article 1, paragraph 1, enunciates the purpose and object of this bill, recalls articles 31, 37, first paragraph, and 44, second paragraph, of the Constitution. In order to combat the demographic decline of small mountain municipalities, a measure for the birth rate and a contribution for the insertion of new residents in the small mountain municipalities is promoted, enhancing the linguistic and cultural particularism of local communities. Paragraph 2 guarantees an exemption of the regional Irpef regional area with the aim of giving support to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. Article 2, paragraph 1, defines which small mountain municipalities are, that is, those that at 31 December 2023 have a population of less than 800 inhabitants and where the seat of their town hall is above 650 meters above sea level. Paragraph 2 establishes that the regional council, within thirty days from the entry into force of the law, approves the list of municipalities that present the characteristics referred to in paragraph 1 and updates it three. Some clarifications are needed: it is quite evident that finding an objective classification is practically impossible, because there are really many aspects that define what a mountain is and what a small municipality is. The two indicators identified, however, seemed the best to include small, mountain and not purely tourist municipalities. In the initial reasoning to the law, the goal was also to understand the mountain villages of the great municipalities, which must not be absolutely of Serie B and which, in many cases, are in conditions equal to small municipalities identified by law. After a passage, however, from Dr. Ceccarelli, head of the economic and social observatory, it emerged that to date there are no disaggregated data on residents by hamlet in the hands of the Region, therefore to date it is impossible to quantify a possible burden deriving from the application of the measures of the law in parts of municipalities, but it is obvious that, in perspective, these data must be there and, if there was the law, there must be this implementation. Article 3, paragraph 1, establishes the birth allowance which Valdôtaine, as a measure aimed at promoting the increase in births and the enhancement of parenting in small mountain municipalities. Paragraph 2 highlights that the check is paid for twelve months, up to a maximum of 5 thousand euros per year in favor of the families at the time of the birth of a child and up to the completion of the third year of the child's life, or of the entry into a family of a minor, in adoption or in foster care, up to three years of age. The beneficiaries of the birth allowance are then expected to be the parents residing in a small mountain municipality of the Autonomous Region Valle d'Aosta, that is, that they transfer their residence to one of the common said and who receive a total income determined for the purposes of the income tax of natural persons up to 50 thousand euros. A sum that is certainly not trivial, but which is used to give help to the middle class, not only to the less well -off. Paragraph 4 underlines how the residence in the small mountain municipality should be maintained for at least ten years, under penalty of forfeiture of the birth allowance and the return of the sums perceived. Ten years is not a banal number at all, but it is precisely because it is necessary in the basic seriousness to undertake this type of life choices that this number has been chosen. Article 4, paragraph 1, establishes an incentive for new residents in small mountain municipalities, the Montagnard. There is an economic contribution for a three -year period of 5 thousand euros per year for the families who transfer their residence to a small mountain municipality in the region and maintain it for at least 10 years. In paragraph 2 the requirements that the members of the family unit must possess: to be Italian citizens or of a Member State of the European Union, i.e. stateless or foreigners with a regular residence permit; receive an overall income, determined for the purposes of the income tax of natural persons up to 50 thousand euros and at least two members of the family unit must be an age, at the date of demand of the contribution, less than 70 years, because in any case it would not have made sense of favoring the arrival of pensioners who certainly could give less value to the small municipalities. In paragraph 3 it is declared that, for those who already reside in the regional territory, in order to be able to transfer and have access to the contribution, the Municipality of origin must have a population of not less than 3 thousand inhabitants at 31 December 2023, because obviously one must not steal residents between small municipalities or in any case municipalities of not so large within the valley. Paragraph 4 establishes that in order to have access to the contribution, the applicant family unit must declare and demonstrate that the property located in the municipality of new residence (be it owned or deriving from a lease of loan or other equivalent title) is intended for a habitual residence for the entire period of enjoyment of the benefit. Paragraph 5 underlines that the amount of the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 has doubled if the families applicant is applied to the small mountain municipality of new residence, an entrepreneurial activity, also through the recovery of real estate of the historical artistic heritage, while Coma 6 underlines that the contribution referred to in paragraph 1 can be combined with the birth allowance referred to in Article 3. The cultural and linguistic aspect in the Local community, it is central in paragraph 7, in fact, for the purpose of achieving the contribution, all members of the family unit aged between 7 and 69 years of age, who are not affected by disabilities, pursuant to the current provisions, must attend, within the first two years of transfer of their residence to a small municipality of the mountains, a francoprovoral and francoprovoral culture course, Töitschu and Titsch of culture of culture Walser in the municipality of Issime/Eischeme and Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. In paragraph 8 it is specified that the regional council, within 60 days of the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, identifies the methods of organizing the course of that paragraph 7, including the entities and associations authorized to teach. On the one hand it is essential to integrate and on the other hand stimulating the population that already resides in a small municipality of the importance of one's languages ​​and cultures in a strong way. Article 5, paragraph 1, establishes that the regional council, within sixty days from the entry into force of this law, with its own resolution, regulates the criteria and the method of assignment of the birth allowance with article 3 and the contribution referred to in Article 4, as well as in agreement with the CPEL, the competences regarding the relative checks. Paragraph 2 underlines how local authorities have the opportunity to integrate with their own resources the amount of the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article four, while in paragraph 3 it should be noted that the CPEL and the small mountain municipalities ensure the support activity to promote the dissemination of information regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article 4 It must promote a communication campaign regarding access to the birth allowance and the contribution referred to in Article 4 in the States of the European Union of Francophone and Germanophones. The communicative campaign in the Germanophon states is aimed at encouraging the settlement of new Germanophon families only in the Walser Municipalities of ISSIME/EISCHEME, Gressoney-Saint-Jean/Onderteil and Gressoney-La-Trinité/Oberteil. All this is absolutely fundamental to always maintain a lively identity from a cultural point of view and above all a specificity, especially, towards the Walser municipalities. Article 6 deals with a measure designed to give help to those who already live in small mountain municipalities. A first step for a great goal, a greater possession of those who live in the mountains and which evidently have more costs that must be counterbalanced. In paragraph 1, in fact, for the tax period 2024/2025/2026, even if the measure would become structural, the subjects with overall income, determined for the purposes of the income tax of individuals, up to 50 thousand euros and which inhabit the small mountain municipalities, are exempt from the payment of the regional Irpef regional. For the first time, I believe, the theme of conventionization in some areas is systematically tackled, only in some areas, which have greater costs. A road, I think, be to follow. Article 7 inserts the evaluation clause, while article 8 defines the financial provisions. Here, I will focus on a moment on the financial provisions, because those who have deepened the law will have asked themselves for the reason for their length. Based on the data received by Dr. Nuvolari in late February 2024, relating to the money allocated but not yet engaged on the various missions and on the various programs, a thorough job was carried out to find the covers. A law concerning local authorities - someone suggested me - should have been based on the resources of current transfers to local authorities. Here, to this I totally opposed me, as local authorities do not sail in gold and because, if the law was approved, in perspective they should continue to be maintained a whole series of services or to be implemented services, therefore cutting funds from current transfers to local authorities would have been wrong. We then tried to find funds by going to touch in the least impactful way possible different missions, with the aim of preventing it from saying: ""With this law, however, the funds to health, education, public works"" and anything else are cut. I hope this effort has been appreciated, the effort not to make trivial, simplistic, resource finding reasoning, in a way to make ends meet, but an in -depth study that would allow an attempt to find the most fair funds and the least impactful possible. Then, in fact, there was the political will to go on ... the resources could very well be found in other missions and other programs. The opinion on the financial coverage of the law, given on 7 October, was negative but on the other hand, what could be expected after the law was discussed seven months after the appointment of the rapporteur that took place on 11 April? It is therefore obvious that the resources had already been spent. This was, in summary, the bill. I thank the colleagues of the League for the support, the offices that have really done an important job and also the majority councilors who, voting against this law in commission, have allowed his discussion in the classroom."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Restano,Claudio,1964.0,M,RV,4,4696,"I intervene on behalf of the Valdôtain Rassemblement Group. We waited with a certain curiosity the comparison in the Commission on the text of the law proposed by the colleagues of the League to understand what the positioning of the majority was and above all understand if there were evolutions regarding the proposed rule and the articulated. Why do I say this? Because we worked on the topic, so much so that we had also presented an inspection initiative and we expressed in commission of doubts that led to the abstention, the doubts about the possibility of applying this rule and above all to the opportunity to coordinate it with a state of the state law that was presented precisely by Rachampmblement Valdôtain and amended in the first commission, producing a commission text. We learned today of the absence of the amendments, perhaps in the light of how the majority was placed in the commission, which expressed a negative vote. From our point of view, this rule - which we appreciate, because we appreciate the effort and will of the colleagues of the League - could be more ambitious, much more ambitious, could foresee a connection, as we said, with the rule that provides for the establishment of the Montane Franche areas, could also in light of what the speaker said correctly and honestly ... he did not have the ambition to be decisive of the problem and faces one of the aspects, Others, produce an inversion or facilitate an inversion of depopulation. It is evident that, compared to the data that the colleague proposed to us, the depopulation in recent decades and even much more has been important, we limit ourselves to watching the trend of recent years, as he said, and this is already significant. The habits of the Aosta Valley have changed, the lifestyles, the ambitions, the way of undertaking the mountain have changed, but we have doubts compared to the definitions, the definition proposed and it is difficult to apply, ""above 650 meters, with a certain population under a certain population"", however, as has already been said, the whole Valle d'Aosta is considered mountain area. Are there any differences, but we can say that a municipality under 600 meters, which however lives an important hydrogeological instability phenomenon, a marked economic backwardness, is not worthy of taking advantage of this rule? Can we say that a municipality at 500 meters - with objective difficulties with regard to tourist flows, the promotion of the territory - is not worthy of taking advantage of this rule? It is very difficult. It is very difficult to say who can be inside, included in the norm or not, but above all what we believe is appropriate to verify and do is coordinate the new text, such as the one proposed by colleagues, with the already existing texts, with what is already being implemented on the mountain, and this is an important thing. We mainly enhance the productive aspect, how can we say that agriculture is not important in the mountains? This text does not speak of agriculture, perhaps because it is already included in other texts, but, in certain mountain areas, it is important to enhance agriculture, it is important to be ascribed as proposed by colleagues, but the standard on the Franca Montagna area that we have proposed also affects other types of taxes, affects Irap, it would be important to coordinate it with this rule. We see, in this proposal, an interesting proposal, but which must necessarily have an evolution. Our group is working on measures to be proposed, we also worked on a text to be proposed, we waited for today's discussion, we wait for the balance, we verify what can boil in the pot, we keep a high attention to this rule, on this topic, as I think the colleagues of all the political forces do, the government including. We consider a rule necessary, there are other regions that have already provided, I speak of at least six regions: Veneto, Trentino, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Piedmont and Lombardy. We believe that the Aosta Valley must produce an important text on the subject, should not leave anyone behind, but above all it should allow to highlight, to put all the particularities of our region to the attention of the regional council, which do not depend on the population density and the altitude, but must consider other problems, other peculiarities. The colleague will express himself as regards the group's vote, I leave these considerations to the Council, believing that he has given the opportunity to reason, especially in future perspective, on what you can perhaps do together."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Jordan,Corrado,1973.0,M,UV,6,4762,"In integration of what has been said, we believe that the Regional Council is needed to work on these measures, to encourage living in the mountains, to encourage our municipalities, the municipalities of the Region that can be considered, as has already been said, marginal. The demographic crisis, the depopulation and the closure of activities are all elements that involve, alas, many municipalities, therefore situations that must be addressed, as far as possible, with the tools we have available, in a strategic vision, with so -called structural policies of longer duration and not with spots or limited interventions. Fighting depopulation in small mountain municipalities necessarily requires an overall integrated approach, which therefore integrates regional policies with state policies and which considers the needs of local communities and the potential of the territory. I don't think there is a miraculous recipe to solve a trend that has multiple causes and which is objectively much more complex than it can be highlighted today in this debate. I find and find interesting the proposal presented by colleague Lavy, if only for having made available some operational proposals, proposals that, however, must return to a virtuous process of actions, including bonuses, as expected, can be useful, but cannot be considered as structural and systematic actions. Actions that, despite being complex, can certainly prove to be more effective. I believe it is necessary and appropriate that this confrontation is in -depth and integrated with the proposals that have been illustrated here in the Commission, on the occasion of the discussion on the application of the Franca zone, but still, and I add, all the initiatives that, in the institutional field, but also externally to the institutions, refer to the university, to the system of trade union organizations: all initiatives that in some way can help us to help the correct recipe must be placed in the institutional field. And I still add that it is necessary to inevitably refer to the mountain law, currently under discussion to Parliament, and to the interesting initiatives that this law could also introduce for our territory. Only in this way, only after, now it is premature, could we have a complete picture of the opportunities that could be put in place and that should, as I said before, integrate with the many actions already present in our region, we must not forget it, actions that favor small municipalities. I think of the education, the reality of subsidized schools, but still to the policies on the plants of the small ski stations, the great equalization in the federalist perspective of regional transfers that see important resources to the smaller municipalities and, again, to social policies, which beyond the difficulties that are evident, are important and if we look at the other regions we do not find so active. As a contribution to the discussion, I indicate some actions that could be the subject of an overall analysis which, in part, are already implemented and are effective, but in some cases they could be more developed. It is evident that it would be important to be able to insert tax relief for natural and legal persons, it was talked about in previous interventions - and the regional additional additional is not enough, it would be necessary to do more, but the matter is of state competence, as colleague Lavy said, and it is to be explored - or with actions related to the taxes and taxes on homes, but here there is an important financial coverage problem. We must encourage coworking spaces and the improvement of connections, Internet connectivity in marginal areas must be distributed, to encourage smart working, support the work remotely for residents or for the owners of the second houses. We must even favor the improvement of the quality of life in relation to essential services in health, with territorial structures and telemedicine, I could add. We must encourage the renovation policies of unused properties even more, as well as imagine policies for supporting the house also in these territories, or even territorial marketing campaigns, to attract new residents and new tourists, focusing on a quality of life quality of life linked to the mountain and nature. Finally, and I am aware of not having made an exhaustive analysis, indeed, collaborations between local authorities are necessary, in order to define inter -municipal services of services to share resources and develop common projects."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,8,4731,"We have already read the proposal of the colleagues of the League some time ago and we also listened to the report of colleague Lavy with interest, a report of which, also in the text accompanied by the law, we appreciated the study that was made of the situation that concerns many municipalities in our region. It is an in -depth, punctual analysis, it is noted that there is behind a job, even a serious job of deepening, and we recognize that there has been an effort from your part in presenting this proposal of the law, in which we recognize, however, some elements of weakness that arouse, also on our part, of the perplexity. The first also concerns the identification of the municipalities that are included in the list of those who would benefit from the proposed measures, and - the colleague Lavy also explained - a synthesis was found among the parameters relating to the number of inhabitants of less than 800 units and the town hall seat above 650 meters. This leads to having, in this list, municipalities that are extremely different and that can hardly be considered as regards critical issues, risks, economic situation. I make an example for everyone: the situation between Pontboset and Torgnon is certainly different, because we know very well - and also the data of the population who cited colleague Lavy say it - that it is not so much a question of inhabitants, but of development or non -development situation that brings these two realities only - I only make - to be very different. I live in one of the municipalities that would return to the list and I must say that there are some other perplexities: colleague Lavy also said that a system had to be found also as regards concrete aid, therefore the contributions, or the system of services. We believe that a bill, which really goes to intervene and help the realities of these municipalities should privilege, rather than a series of contributions, the introduction or implementation, because it is not that there are no services, but the implementation of services. Then there is also an aspect that it does not seem so easy to apply, it is that of the condition that we must respect to maintain what you have called which Valdôtain and the other relating to the birth rate, the Montagnard. The condition is said to be the residence in the municipality where this contribution was kept for ten years. Now we know that there is a dynamic of the movements of the population which is very strong; I speak of the municipality where I live, which I know well: we have very fast movements of the population, people who come, children who attend school for a period and who then move, and I do not think that the possibility of having these 5 thousand euros for the birth of the child or for the residence in the Municipality, can constitute a strong attractiveness and a motivation to remain over time on that territory. As for which Montagnard and Chèque Valdôratin, it is said that it would be necessary, for each new family unit that will decide to move to one of the small mountain municipalities, attend a francoprovoral language or culture course or Titsch or Töitschu language. I believe it is already very difficult - I think above all of the people who come from distant countries, but not only - to create the conditions for there is a possibility of daily communication, therefore of knowledge of the Italian or French language, and I think that learning our languages ​​and dialects also must be a thing linked to a will of integration that some people have. I refer to my reality, we have people who are of Romanian or Moroccan origin who speak very well the patois, but it was not an imposition, they learned it by being with the population, creating ties and also having a personal will of integration, of knowledge of the territory. A course imposed for each family unit that would be resided in these municipalities seems to us to be a little forcing. Same question for the birth allowance, which is like the other. While appreciating the effort that has been made and sharing some of the assessments that have been made, because it is certainly a problem, what we have of the depopulation of the mountain medium, we think that perhaps the reflection must be wider, more articulated and focus on a range of services that must be guaranteed to those who have voluntarily or not voluntarily decided to continue living in the mountains or coming to live in the average mountain, for which our vote will be a vote."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Chatrian,Albert,1975.0,M,UV,10,7725,"I join the thanks, colleague Lavy, for the work that has been done and allow me some reasoning on this bill, but above all on the architectural system proposed by the colleague. We must look honestly, around this classroom there is a completely different Aosta Valley compared to the numbers and passages that have also been made in relation, so we absolutely have to know our story, we absolutely have to know our potential, and there are many, but we must also have the ability to accompany the path on our legislative level: what has been done, what is being done but above all what can be done or must still be done. Certainly there is space, if today we face this theme in this way it is because regarding a whole series of measures, laws, supports, regarding identity and even culture, despite everything, we can tell us - it is not beautiful perhaps as a word - but we have kept. If we look at our neighbor Piedmont, if we look at our nearby Lombardy, their lateral valleys, I think we have been quite good, but we probably have to have that ability to find other solutions. To find other supports - however I put the economic question at the center, not the financial question - Metto the quality of life in the center. The bill is ""urgent measures to combat the depopulation of small mountain municipalities"", whether they are small, medium or a middle ground it doesn't matter. I think that the most important challenge is to guarantee 365 days a year of the services, because then the risk - and I speak of where I live, where I know absolutely more - is that all the services are guaranteed to the high tourist lands for nine months, but that in those other three months they are practically ghost countries. The average tourist lands perhaps manage to guarantee for 12 months a whole series of public or private services, but with many difficulties, but then we have a medium mountain that perhaps - I remember the passage that the colleague made before - suffers more than the others, because it does not have those tourist potential and, therefore, has neither in season nor out of season, a whole series of services that instead the other two elements that I have highlighted have. In all this, undoubtedly, I think that the most delicate part is that linked to work-family conciliation. What is the goal to be able to create those conditions for families, new or not new, decide to live and not survive in high or medium mountains? It is being able to reconcile the work ... I open a parenthesis: in the high lands there is a lot in the two seasons, I close the parenthesis. In the intermediate lands, therefore in the media mountain, it is more delicate, but there we can work in a different way with transport and on this I open another parenthesis: it seems to me that the efforts as audience that are making themselves are truly important efforts, I highlight it knowing very well the efforts that the public is making but, despite everything, today, for a family that lives in a medium mountain, or in the high lands, and it does not have the private means, It is on site, family-work conciliation. I brought examples that we all know, but perhaps every now and then it is also important to reiterate them and highlight them. Returning to the question, I repeat, some ideas are interesting within this system, however, they must then be accompanied ... of one has already been said by other colleagues: by the law of the mountain, which we hope that you find at a mountain level, by those who at least know these territories and these needs ... and, on the other hand, by the implementation rule that can give us the opportunity to go, why not, to further regulate measures and with also innovative, even innovative instruments, I put as last, because perhaps the most important challenge on our most political level is to be able to pass that message linked to the fact that it becomes an important but different choice of life compared to the central axis of the main valley which is the one that from Pont-Saint-Martin reaches up to Courmayeur. In all this we cannot hide, I connect Lavy, she is perhaps loving as me numbers, but then, when the numbers are known, you have to find solutions to critical issues. We have a decreasing demography that is very strong, in 2012-2013-2014 the born in the Aosta Valley were about 1,300, today the born in the Aosta Valley in the last two years are about 700; It is a further element: despite all the efforts we are making as an autonomous region, these are undoubtedly raw data, but which not only have to make us reflect, but which must encourage us to find further solutions. I finish saying that on this basis, on the fact - we hope in the short term - that the law on the mountain can be approved at national level, which can be put together, however, all those measures that are now inserted in various regional laws. We will go in a few weeks to approve the 2025-2026 budget ... the dignity that this majority, and I hope that other political forces also approve those articles ... We give some certainties again to the system of local authorities; Local authorities, municipalities, which guarantee most of the services on the territories, local authorities that give those services above all, he mentioned the children, medium or a little larger medium and high mountain municipalities. Without these tools, I think that today our lateral valleys would be similar to the Piedmontese and, alas, similar to the Lombard ones. She reported very well within the relationship, making us return in 1860-1870, when Magdeleine and Chamis had inhabitants; I live in Torgnon and Magdeleine does not have 100 inhabitants, Chamis does not reach 100 inhabitants, and Torgnon and Antey together barely reach 1,000 inhabitants. To make examples. First, colleague Minelli, rightly, highlighted the difference between a Pontboset and a Torgnon, but I would not make the war of the poor and I would try to find solutions in order not to make people survive people on average or in the high mountains, but to be able, instead, to be able to guarantee that quality of life - which in the end is our role, that of creating the best laws, legislation to achieve those certain objectives - To make drastic choices, because, I assure you, putting together only the main -services, transport, school, health, sports, aggregations policies, local authorities, work and work conciliation (I have put eight) -if one stops only exclusively to the economic -financial question, if there were all the measures that as a region we put in the field, I think our valleys would be completely different. Despite this, you can probably make a further effort, a further blow of the kidneys, it would be nice to be able to do it together, this can also be an interesting starting point, intertwining proposals that are also innovative, but, if I can give advice, colleague Lavy, we put the exclusively tax, economic, financial issue a little aside, I assure you that the most important part is - according to my point of view, our quality of the point of view. Life of people who choose to remain anyway, because many, often, love the mountain, on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, but living 365 days is a choice of life."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,12,2822,"I will intervene briefly, also taking the last inspiration of his colleague Charrian. I will abstract from tax issues, the cheaper issues, because I think that this law, with the work that colleague Lavy has made, is a bit of an attempt - which I would also define original and fully in the wake of a true autonomistic spirit - to also create something new, that is, if we are here, in the end, the highest role that we can have as advisors is precisely that of legislators, therefore an attempt that I repeat, Also for this sense of novelty, of originality that is put on the table; Even pioneering as an attempt, certainly - all pioneering attempts, have their defects, that is, they will surely be able to have them, and here the colleagues who make notes on some peculiarities of the law, clearly have their reasons - but, I repeat, it is a pioneering attempt and in this way it must be evaluated. In my opinion, this bill demonstrates a considerable interest, also because, of the background, in addition to the economic and fiscal issues - on which colleagues are much more iron than me, which are a terrifying accountant from that point of view - there are other themes below: that for example of identity, which is a fundamental theme, and that in some way this law affects. If we ask ourselves today who are the Aosta Valleys, today, in 2024, how can we define the Aosta Valley in 2024, when already starting from the last century, starting from fascism, we had the first migratory waves? We think of the Venetians, then we think of the post -war period with Calabrian immigration, and today immigrations from various parts of the world. In this law, therefore, there is an attempt - in my opinion, strong and intelligent - to propose solutions that can encourage those who can and want to integrate on the Aosta Valley territory and be part of a community, a community that uses in this case the linguistic means as a system to make participation, but which is put on the table. I understand the colleague who says: ""Put it as mandatory becomes something ..."", but it is an attempt to create a cohesion, create a community, on the basis that are our identity characteristics, because the French, and perhaps even more francoproves, is something that we must not lose. In conclusion, practically everything has already been said from the colleague's report, I remitted that, with this attempt, our party shows in a certain sense a vitality and a pioneering spirit to present laws that are also new and that, albeit with some defects, certainly means, for our part, a will to look even beyond the horizons that have been used so far by those who have governed the Region in recent years."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,11486,"I thank the colleagues for the debate. I will go in order, to try to answer even the various issues that were put on the plate, because I knew very well that in the end the tones of the answers would have been, a sort of benaltrism, the need to make a global measure, the need to make reflections and is fine, we go on years, years and years to make reflections, but the phenomenon we see him, but, in fact, I go with order, starting from the words of the colleague, Some way, this text could not be related to the one on the Montane Franche areas, which we have absolutely supported, because it is something interesting, which however has a limit: temporariness, so if a franca mountaineer area is applied in a certain territory, lasts last years and then the condition remains, returns as the previous one, because the structural deficits of the territory remain. If one is half an hour of road from Aosta, it is not that with the Franca Montana area that time is reduced, it always remains half an hour on the road, it is so; It is certainly very interesting, but the Franca zone has a character of temporariness, so after all those measures end. If we wanted to have collaboration, it was possible to do it, because the text on the Montane Franche areas was promoted it seems to me in July, if I remember correctly, and this law is filed by the month of April, so there had been the will to talk to each other, this was there. I noticed, it is already under discussion of that law, which however you have taken inspiration from this law, from article 6, that on the exemption of the regional Irpef regional: you have put it a little more generally, but this does not seem to me so much collaboration but, more than anything else, and here, and here for the state proposal - it is certainly an interesting proposal - at least one article was a bit copied. On the criteria, it is obvious and I said it in the first place: the criteria are absolutely questionable, that is, who is who can define what mountains and what is a mountain? We made an attempt, but where is yours? Why is it easy to say: ""Eh, these criteria, 800 inhabitants, 650 meters, are not good, you have to find others"", and what are these others? What are they? It's easy to say, isn't it? Try to put some of them and then let's reason. The first day I arrived in the commission I said: ""If you have proposals, do them""; Zero proposals, not even one, so you don't come to say that the criteria are wrong, they are not completely convincing, they are the first to say it, but if you had a better proposal you had to do it. I have not seen proposals. Colleague Jordan said that this would be a law that has spots and limited interventions: I don't know if the text is clear, it seems to me yes, these measures are structural, therefore, if this law was approved, the measures would last over time until one wants, all the two contributions and also the additional IRPEF exemption. I inserted the three -year period because I was obliged to insert it, because it must be based on the tax period on the three -year period, but that measure would also be structural. Then I agree that the Irpef regional exemption is not enough, I agree, but in the meantime we start doing this if possible and if there is the will, since we speak so much of the mountain. For the question of the choice of life, the 10 years, the fact of the francoprovale course Titsch and Töitschu: such a measure, to bring people to live in a context like the mountain one, which is not absolutely simple, indeed, it is a serious choice of life, very serious ... so one knows that, if he decides to come and live in that territory there and access the contributions, he must remain there for ten years. If one has doubts of not staying there, it does not come out, it does not come, it does not make that choice there, it goes elsewhere, goes to the city and does not make that choice or knows where it is, if it is happy. Same thing for the language course, one knows that he has to do it, if he doesn't want to do it, enough, he doesn't come, it's not a problem. This is used to integrate those who come, but also to give us a nice wake up to us, because we are the first not to speak our patois to our children, it is a dramatic thing, and then it is obvious that everything is lost. If instead at the Valle d'Aosta it is said: ""Look, there is the one who arrived yesterday, who is doing the course of Patois, you talk it?"", ""No"", perhaps a minimum of pride motorcycles can be born and say: ""No, our languages ​​we must also be to talk to her, it is not that it must speak to her what came yesterday. Speech of the services: the speech of the services is absolutely central, but the two must go hand in hand. Compared to today in the mountain territories? We have bank branches - I will do an interpellation regarding bank desertification and so on - but how many schools did we have more? Many. If 40 years ago we had more services and today there are less, it means that the services are not the condition for which people remain at all costs in the mountains - it is a very important condition but it is not the only one - so one must act on an aspect that is often not considered here: living in the mountains costs more, we already think only at the cost of heating, so if we do not go to those who live in certain territories and have more costs, it is obvious that someone can decide. Then, always his colleague Chatrian, she said: ""If we face this theme today, it is because we kept this bad term, she said it) compared to other regions"", and they are very accorded, if we go to see in Piedmont, certain valleys are dramatically empty, there is no longer anyone or almost. Perhaps we are 20-30 years back compared to those valleys, if, in some way, to date we do not make measures that can reverse the situation, that is the goal to which you get there, because - she always said it, colleague Chatrian - demography is an exact science. Today we were born, in perspective we could have all inhabitants, without considering those who then leave, and there is another matter. Surely the theme of services is to be carried out and surely this is a text that cannot be overall, but if we want to wait an overall text, Campa Cavallo, we put two centuries to put everything inside. Let's start with a text ... Then the interesting thing, and the President of the President Testalin also said it, when he came, he said: ""Do you have doubts? On some issues, I am primarily in having doubts""; And it is there, but let's try experimentally to carry on such a law. We choose two to three municipalities, which may also have different characteristics, and we try in some way to experiment with these measures. After five years we see the results, if they are not there, I am the first to say: ""No, this is a wrong road"", but if we don't even try, we don't come to say that this is something that perhaps does not need. Let's try experimentally, then let's see, but here there is never the courage to do anything, so we sit on what we are already doing and in the meantime everything comes down. Because here, to talk about the mountains, to talk about high lands, to talk about villages, there are not many, or rather, there are some who are mostly those who still live in these territories and, if we count ourselves, those who come from more mountain municipalities, we are no longer many, indeed, we are very, but very few. Here, also in the perspective of future representation, it is obvious that in perspective who comes from the city, those who come from Plaine, have more and more a weight also electoral and representative, therefore those who come from the mountains in the classroom will be less and less, because, I see it, of my generation, of people who live there and who then deal with politics there are very few, so in perspective we risk delivering the Aosta Valley - that someone says. Mountain knows nothing. This is an important aspect, therefore, or we do something now, even with strong, experimental measures, otherwise we raise the white flag, we consider Mountain Piazza Chanoux, because someone will come to say this, now in certain parameters Aosta is considered in full mountain. For heaven's sake, some fractions yes, I am, but Aosta is not a mountain, I'm sorry. I will still reserve in the declaration of vote maybe some considerations, because we have many paradoxes. For example, we have a Deputy of the Union Valdôtaine which offers in Parliament a motion for internal areas and mountain areas. Okay, we are all capable of proposing motions, but then I would like to understand what he thinks about this bill, understand if it can be interesting or not. The fact that I noticed, because obviously it is not that once I presented the bill I was there to sleep, I shot and went to 23 municipalities, from 23 mayors, who were the protagonists of this bill. Some of these, who then amazed myself, were amazed that there was a regional councilor for the first time, a regional councilor who would go to find them - which he sincerely left me amazed - and all these mayors have still expressed great attention to this law, but really great attention, some more, who less, for heaven's sake, knowing very well that it was not decisive, but we know that the policy acts in certain systems and the CPEL. He acts, we see him: many mayors are the first to complain about depopulation, but then they do not vote for this law. Many mayors are there that complain that they have desert centers and then vote against the moratorium who would block the birth of new businesses, therefore zero consistency by many mayors. Honor, however, to those who instead with pride - because I was told that someone has not flattened, as many do - to an opinion of the cpel proposed by some mayors, in a strong way, they expressed themselves against that abstention opinion of the cpel, saying that this law could be a tool to combat the phenomenon of depopulation. Honor to these mayors who truly have courage, because we know very well that not to align in certain environments, when there are certain proposals, it is not at all simple. This was a complex bill, which touches one of the aspects of the depopulation of the mountain, which I called a puzzle; This is a piece of the puzzle, and everyone said that it is made by also interesting measures. So I tell myself: but why not try it? Because either you say a lie, saying that they are interesting measures and you do not consider them such, or fill your mouth of words and then, in the practical, when there is something different, parallel to the speech of the services and anything else, you do nothing. The doubt is that if this proposal had been made by a majority councilor, probably all these doubts, all these dietrologies, all these ""eh, but a general evaluation"", these reasoning would not have been made. This is a doubt, for heaven's sake, I know very well that it doesn't work like this. I finished, I will keep myself for the declaration of vote."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,16,5844,"The president will also intervene, I will limit myself to some observation, starting naturally from what has already been said, that is, the difficulties, what happens we all know, but fortunately we are not at the year zero, because, thanks to autonomy, our territory, even with all the limits, remains inhabited, remains alive, above all - as it has already been done - if we appear only with the nearby Piedmontese valleys: even from a political and administrative point of view, They even depend on the metropolitan area of ​​Turin and, if we had not had autonomy, it is very likely that today we would find ourselves in the same and identical situation. The theme that has been raised is interesting and the proposal is also interesting, which however has a whole series of fragility, then the reasoning of the councilor Lavy is: ""Better a little bit than nothing"". Instead, I believe that, when you have to decide a line, you have to do it completely, and I will try in this regard, in a few minutes, to make some reasoning. I am back from a meeting on the Alpine macroration in Slovenia: it is an assembly that must surely be strengthened, has weaknesses, was officially born in the early 1910s and I have allowed myself to report to the attention of colleagues in asking for greater political commitment and less technocratic vision within the alpine macro -crown, because I believe that the themes that we must face today are four more: the first is the climate change, which will change in a climate change. depth our territory; The second topic is the energy transition, also given the ambitious prospects that the same advice has given itself; The digital revolution, someone has mentioned the fact that the repopulation also passes through techniques such as coworking, and, again, the demographic crisis that, in the Aosta Valley, is actually added to the depopulation, that is, the choice that many Aosta Valley, since the post -war period, have made to go down, who in the largest municipalities of the valley floor, who instead in the city of Aosta who in the meantime has spread in what we call the Plaine. Another topic is added that is central to believing that the Aosta Valley is all mountains, which of course does not mean that then there can be there inside the classifications by area; I do not convince me the altimetry, because someone recalled that today - as Bernard Janin said, the famous geographer - those who are most in crisis are those of the medium mountain, if we use the altimetry, we will somehow also facilitate tourist resorts where well -being is quite evident. The overloads affect, what the University of Valle d'Aosta is doing is important, taking up a theme of a few years ago: to understand what the impact of school, transport, health is meaning; All expenses that weigh a lot on our regional budget and that demonstrate the peculiarity of the areas in the mountains that will have to be remarked, especially when they arrive next to it, or perhaps no longer next to the differentiated autonomy, the famous Lep. Another scenario: there is a European scenario that we must follow, because we have the same problems: the same president Kompatscher, in a dialogue also together with President Textinin, reminded us how they have a high demography but which has fallen below that percentage of the fertility rate that guarantees a replacement to the population. We are tombs from this point of view. Professor Rosina's study of the Catholic University of Milan has shown that in 2034 we will have 10 thousand Valley less in the intermediate age, that is, the most productive one. I would add, because it is very important, that the possible regional law, that in some way regulates the particularity of higher territories than the average, must take into account the law on the mountain which, with its 28 articles, has been approved by the Senate, not because we must copy - I am always for original legislation - but because this law allows a part of having a whole series of particularities that can be demonstrated in the legislation of the regions and proofs, They are interventions on the subject that are not our competence. I think it would be interesting to imagine reopening a discussion when we find ourselves in front of a complete text that, among other things, affects one of the main knots for the Italian mountain which is that of the perimeter of the mountain areas, because, if there is too much mountain (as today happens in ancient perimeters, even of the 1950s) it is very difficult to imagine specific interventions, which also apply - I remember it in conclusion - for the European Union. With the new president of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, right in Slovenia, we imagined a pact of the European mountain, starting with the Alpine mountain, because it is very clear that today in article 174 of the treaties we speak of the mountain areas, but that necessary directive that should say that the mountain is, which is different in the Massif Central rather than on the Pyrenees, rather than on the Apennines, has remained suspended, Regulation taking into account that many of the subjects that we have in article 2 of our statute of autonomy - I think of agriculture - are basically linked to decisions that are taken by European politics. It is therefore right to give the recognition of the intellectual effort, of the legal effort, to reach something, however, with all frankness, I believe that the picture is more complex and it can be said that if this was the beginning of a discussion it is good, but it cannot be considered a final phase."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Testolin,Renzo,1968.0,M,UV,18,6328,"I believe that downstream of the latest intervention by colleague Caveri little remains to be added. I make some considerations of order more closely linked to the tissue on which this regulatory initiative wanted to enter; An already wide quite large regulatory fabric, which we have had the opportunity to share even during an inspection activity (remembered by the colleague Restano) which underlined how within the evolutionary path and attention to the mountain territory and the difficulties of living it ... because it is one thing to seek assumptions and indications to support - even continuously, assuming that it is the best way - the population that lives in the mountains that can be done at lower costs, one thing is to make it use also in step with the times ... even for so to speak ""infrastructured"" and also prodigious of opportunities, especially working and maintenance of their family in the mountains with adequate services; These are two slightly different concepts and the main aspect is to go and observe how a whole series of initiatives that we had already shared at that location have tried over time to enhance the characteristics of our mountain, with safety on roads and with the infrastructure, which has now started in the 90s, of the dorsal that should have brought the optical fiber - and brought it, up to our highest villages. Still yesterday, in an interesting meeting developed in the context of the colleague Caveri department, with Infratel, opportunities that can actually create new potential for those who want to move to the mountains have actually been drawn. This is a job that daily is accompanied by specific laws to try to enhance the job offers of our territory. His colleague Jordan mentioned it, also taking up a track that we had already presented a few weeks ago: from supporting the ski stations to mountain schools, the concessions on transport, a particular attention also to the sizing and practicability of the same, the initiatives on neighborhood exercises - to talk about situations that are developed within the regional council - but, still, in the broader area, among the opportunities that can be made available to the mountain, the resources are available. Europeans who, primarily, through the rural development plan and the activities related to the agricultural world, have tried to enhance a whole series of historical and traditional activities that maintained on our territory of the settlement opportunities even in the small municipalities and especially in the small municipalities where a company rightly, one, two, five people, a family make the difference, in spite of what may perhaps happen in the valley floor. A situation that is also very articulated at national level, I remember that in the years 2015-2016, when there were the first support activities of the marginal areas, paradoxically the case occurred where, for example, Cogne, which is a tourist station of primary importance for our region, was included in the marginal areas when - now I would not like to make mistakes - Avise or Saint -Nicolas, which had slightly different altimetric characteristics. Not such an important drop in population percentage as Cogne was not included. Two paradoxes that, if we go to see the two locations, give you a mountain feeling that is not exactly the same. This is to reach the fact that there is a network, a series of initiatives and activities that continue to be developed, such as the investments that are perorate on our territory also at the level of ski lifts, but also all those activities that try to bring security even for those who live in the mountains: we have already mentioned it a couple of times, but I will never tire of saying it: the helicopter rescue rather than the enhancements of those ski-high activities linked to the world of the world of the world of the world Randonnée, who can and must also bring young people - just like you said - on our territory. This must be accompanied by - rightly said who preceded me - of the most structured, more structural indications, which certainly pass by the law of the mountain, which has been questioned, which gives a guideline on which a regional mechanism of in -depth and adaptation can also be grafted to the characteristics and peculiarities of our territory; On the other hand, a law on the Franca area that has as its objective not so much stabilizing in time and years, over the decades, support and a contribution, but creating the conditions to relaunch above all an activity in our marginal areas, which is conclaimed and that it is guaranteed, to which it will probably have to contribute, in an important way, the region with its resources, because we say that the feeling is rather what must be cleared the principle of being able to identify independently, On which we want to go and intervene, because evidently - she teaches me - Courmayeur rather than Valtournenche, perhaps they need Rhêmes -Saint -Georges less than Lillianes, Gaby or Champorcher, of initiatives that can be developed on their territory with an important help, limited perhaps over time but that can allow you to activate in these territories of the initiatives that can then give legs to a circle. virtuoso that can report interest in our territory. This is what we had already said in the Commission, net of other technicalities relating to what is the coverage, not the coverage. However, not, not for respectability, the fact of recognizing the initiative of its transversal sharing, which has also been shown by the colleagues who intervened; I also appreciated the fact that he underlined the negative vote that allowed to bring to the classroom and discuss this proposal of the law and I believe that the interest is transversal, as has been underlined, and that there will still be time and way of working carefully especially on those two elements that can really make the difference in this context."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Ganis,Christian,1973.0,M,FI,20,3096,"I thank the present and the proposals of this bill, the 138 of the League. The bill 138 represents an attempt to face one of the most pressing challenges of the mountain communities, which is that of depopulation. The Aosta Valley, like many other mountain regions, is experiencing a progressive exodus of the population of the smallest centers towards the cities; This phenomenon has significant repercussions on the local economy, on the culture and enhancement of our territories. The proposal aims to reverse this trend through a series of concrete measures, focused mainly on economic incentives, therefore the birth allowance or which is a economic contribution to families who choose to have children in the small mountain municipalities, incentives for new residents, the Montagnard, tax breaks and contributions for those who ask or decide to settle in these territories and the enhancement of the territory through the promotion of local culture, therefore supporting local culture. To traditions and minority languages, the development of sustainable tourism, investments and tourist activities that respect the environment and the guarantee of basic services such as health, school and transport, we talked about it before. From a first analysis, the League's proposal presents several strengths, a concrete approach, therefore the proposed measures are specific and targeted to solve problems, attention to families, therefore: incentives for birthday, families with children and a valorisation of the territory. In our opinion, although the proposal represents a step forward in the direction of a regional policy more attentive to the needs of the mountain municipalities, some problems emerge; One of these is economic sustainability: putting these measures into practice requires significant economic resources and long -term effectiveness. Economic incentives can be a first step, but a more structural approach is needed to guarantee long -term sustainability of the mountain municipalities; The collaboration with local authorities: the success of these measures also depends on the collaboration with the Municipalities, colleague Charrian well recalled. To reach a conclusion, the proposal of law 138 of the League represents an important contribution to the debate on the enhancement of mountain areas, raising a theme of great importance and future for our region, however it is important to underline that the problem linked to the phenomenon of depopulation cannot be solved only with economic incentives, we have said several times and reiterated that a series of long -term territorial development actions are necessary, which take into account all the actors involved at the end of the end. to achieve concrete and lasting results. Starting from the assumption that this bill could also be amended in order to improve it and make it more suitable for the needs of our community, we as a group appreciate its work and for this reason we will vote for it."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Lavy,Erik,1995.0,M,LEGA VDA,22,4170,"Thanks, president, for the latest considerations that emerged after the government's reply. I don't know if the commissioner Caveri really read ""Tradition et Renouveau"" by Janin because otherwise I don't know, some reasoning perhaps would not have made them ... (interruption outside the microphone by the commissioner Caveri.) ... It is not absolutely offensive, we would miss more. The speech of the altimetry, for heaven's sake, is questionable, but maybe I would invite you one day, indeed, to live some time, to go to Perloz Marine: I would like to see if that is not a mountain. It is not high mountains, for heaven's sake, but it is a mountain. Then the question of climate change is fine, it is obvious that we are faced with epochal challenges, as there have always been throughout history, for heaven's sake, today we have new ones and therefore we must rightly adapt. The theme of the overloads, which she pulled out - if she first offended, now gives her act that she has brought out a theme that is essential - the theme of the overloads is central, I said it: living in the mountains costs more, and this is why I believe that there is a need for economic help, on the one hand with contributions, on the other with a possession, things that are proposed by this law, therefore, for charity, do not understand the way? Okay, but, as I said before, where is your proposal? The speech of the demography, which was also touched by colleague Chatrian: ""Eh, but this law speaks of a birth check"", more demography than that ... so you can say everything, but not that this law does not touch the discourse of demography. Then the President of Testalin as usual a little flies ... but the thing I reflect on - and on the notes I had the answer that she had given to the colleague remain, when I had mentioned law 17 and various laws - is that it does not seem to me that in these laws there is an ad hoc part for the mountain territory. There are laws that apply to all the territories, therefore, if we take 17, those who have a farm from the valley floor who has a farm at 1,500 meters are benefit from it. It is obvious that it is a law that also helps those who live in the mountains, it is not a law that is only made for those who live in the mountains and that compensate for the overloads of those who live in the mountains; This is the speech. Our laws are not diversified, they are the same for everyone, on the one hand it is fine, on the other side you have to, I think, also make reflections, but then it is not that with those laws only those who live in the mountains are helping. I really, to conclude, because I understood that there is not so much, I really would like you to go for a ride in many villages of our municipalities, around the valley, all the municipalities have villages that are now abandoned, or almost, and there you will understand the roots of the depopulation, truly. Go to the valleys to talk to those who stay and that he will explain that his son has decided to leave, perhaps not even abroad, has fallen. You will understand from these people the reason why people go away: the overloads - she said, councilor Caveri - and those villages there, if it's okay, will become second houses, if it goes badly, they will be diluted. It is this policy of saying ""we are already doing"" that killing those villages, who kills programming. Let's face it for once, it is not possible to say ""we are already doing, everything is fine"", look at the Piedmont valleys, we see them all the valleys of Piedmont, but if we continue like this, we also get to the Piedmont Valleys. Let's question ourselves, we carry on measures that can also be experimental, the free zone speech is absolutely positive but that's not enough, it is not enough! Do you know when we will no longer talk about depopulation? When the last elderly of the last village is missing, then there will no longer be the problem of depopulation, because there will be no more anyone who lives in the Aosta Valley. The fact that there has not been the will to think concretely on a law and that this law has favorable, interesting principles, but that are not enough, is a truly stabbing to those who live in the mountains."
47990,XVI,20/11/2024,"ENTI LOCALI, Comuni",en,Perron,Simone,1979.0,M,LEGA VDA,24,2155,"Obviously I will vote positively for this law. If before I highlighted the side of the autonomistic spirit that distinguishes this proposal of the law, on the other I simply want to emphasize, as I said before, beyond the economic factor, an element that strongly characterizes our political force, that is, the League, because this is, from another point of view, the attempt to attract on our territory, in particular on that of the mountains, an immigration that can be chosen, an immigration that can be of the sustainable type of those They demand or think that anyone can arrive in our territory, even when they have attitudes or cultures or mentality that hardly integrate with our millennial culture. I repeat, a law perfectly in the wake of our party that sees and thinks that those who can come to our territory and feel and become fully Valley in full must be people who have the tools to integrate; In this case it would be the regional body that provided tools from a linguistic point of view, which is fundamental. From this point of view, therefore, I believe that it is a bill that is a real shame that it remains there, but I think it will remain, in any case, in the archives and one day, when perhaps the historians will look back and listen to the debates of this advice, they will be able to see who had at least the courage to propose something, even on an experimental title, because the colleague said it very well: even on an experimental title, rather than we can adapt to the dynamics Without making the effort, perhaps even wrong, perhaps that does not work, but an effort that represents a novelty towards phenomena of great importance and that unfortunately we cannot govern. I believe that this is a real shame, but, I repeat, those who proposed something new and had the courage to do it will remain in the annals, while, instead, on the other hand, those who perhaps did criticism, had good intentions, then on the table, however, he never put something innovative."

As standard B, and also thinking that some immigrants, for example, could be advantaged: all those who come from the French -speaking countries, probably and rightly, would have a benefit, so I think this is an element to be evaluated. However, it is difficult to answer the question I ask: ""If economic aid can affect the life choices of the family and in particular of our children"". I believe that other values ​​are, for example the love of the mountain, of culture, of traditions, which are not monetizable, even at the cost of sacrifices, then tomorrow everything changes everything.

47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,2,8009,"The next introduction of fifth generation mobile telephony technology, below, obviously we will call 5G, will give rise to new population exposure scenarios to radio frequency electromagnetic fields, which will be put in frequency calls, 694-790 MHz, 3.6-3.8 Ghz and 26.5-27.5 GHz, different from those used currently for mobile telephony, from 800 mHz to 2.6 ghz. Particular novelty of the 5G consists in the fact that it will not be aimed only at communication between people, but also to the so-called internet of things, in which the various wireless devices communicate directly to each other, using in particular electromagnetic waves belonging to the band 26.5-27.5 GHz, often indicated as millimeter waves, even if the latter correspond more precisely to the frequencies between 30 and 300 ghz, a wavelength between 1 and 10 mm .. electromagnetic waves of such high frequency, during their propagation, are unable to penetrate through the buildings or in any case to overcome obstacles and are also easily absorbed by the rain and leaves. For this reason, it will be necessary to use, to the extent of the current mobile telephony technologies, the so -called Small Cells, areas of territory covered by the radio frequency signal whose dimensions, which can go from about ten indoor meters to a few hundred outdoor meters, are much lower than those of the macro cells, which can also be extended to several kilometers. This will involve the installation of numerous antennas and this proliferation of antennas is one of the main causes of concern about the population about possible health risks connected to the electromagnetic emissions of 5G. Following the evaluation of the 2013 IARC, which had defined electromagnetic fields with radio frequencies as possible carcinogenic for the effects on head tumors related to the prolonged use of the mobile phone, numerous studies were conducted that investigated the associations between long -term exposure to electromagnetic fields and various health problems, oncological and non -oncological. The exhibitions deriving not from the use of the mobile phone but from other sources, such as the SRB radio base stations, are different in nature, above all because the possible effects are not limited to the head and, as it appears by monitoring studies, are of less intensity. To date, studies on the health effects of exhibitions at radio basic sections provide contrasting results. Moreover, due to the issuing limits, 62% of the existing sites in urban areas would be not updated to 5G and extra costs, to create the covers, would amount to approximately 1.3 billion euros per operator. To keep the 6 volts per meter, an expense of around 4 billion euros per year is estimated, a decidedly high cost for telephony companies. It should also be emphasized that 5G emissions combine with other forms of electromagnetic emissions, all with the consequences that these emissions may have both on health and on the environment. A group of Swedish researchers published the first study in the world that documents the immediate effects on human health of 5G radiation, these are groups of people who, between 2023 and 2024, began to feel bad immediately after the installation of the new 5G antennas near their homes, precisely at a distance between 3 and 538 meters. In some cases the symptoms would have been so serious as to force people to move elsewhere. The research was conducted by the Onnnart Hardell oncologist of the Swedish Foundation for the Environment and Cancer Research, known for epidemiological studies on tumors between mobile users, in collaboration with Mona Nilsson of the Swedish Foundation for the protection of radiation. The researchers measured the electromagnetic field in the homes of those who complained of health problems related to 5G and documented that 5G involves a significant increase in radiofrequency radiation pulsed compared to previous generations of mobile telephony. The people under the studio lived for years close to mobile telephony repeaters, but had never complained disorders with the reactions of 2G, 3G and 4G, but began to feel bad within 24 hours following the activation of 5G. The Swedish study is particularly innovative, because it documents the effects on the health of the radiation of 5G in the real conditions of use, while to date there were only studies on the biological effects of the different frequencies of 5G. The biological effects of radiation are not only linked to the power density, which gives information on its intensity and is responsible for heating, but are also determined by the quality of the radiation, or by its pulsation, polarization and remodeling. The most common symptoms that were found precisely in the people in question were sleep disorders, tiredness, headache, irritability, concentration problems, compromise of short -term memory and skin problems. These are the same symptoms described more than 50 years ago as microwave syndrome or radio frequency disease. In all the observed cases, the radiation levels were lower than the levels considered safe by international standards; In fact, these protect only from the effects of immediate heating of radiation, or from thermal effects, and not from the other biological effects that are due to the interference of the external electromagnetic field with that of living systems, and therefore non -thermal effects. In confirmation of the role of the radiation of 5G there is also the observation that the irradiated subjects, once transferred to another house with lower radiation levels, were better; The symptoms mitigated and in most cases they disappeared completely after a short period. In Italy the exhibition limits are measured on an average of 24 hours and not 6 minutes, as happens all over the world. The 6 -minute interval is the biological time necessary for cells to dissipate the heat produced by the radiation of radio frequency through blood circulation. It is therefore a time necessary to protect cells from the effects of heating produced by the electromagnetic field. This choice was made in 2012 by the Monti government which brought the average of measurement of the radiation from radio frequency from 6 minutes to 24 hours, with the aim of diluting the measured values ​​and in fact increase the limits of radiation radiation. It is therefore clear that, with the growing use of these technologies, studies conducted by third parties are necessary with respect to the regional administration, in the name of transparency and full accessibility of information to the community, in order to guarantee the population clear information, especially in the event of the installation of new antennas near schools, hospitals and residential areas. Moreover, the European Council itself, by recommendation of 12 July 1999, in act 519 EC, provided for in point 6 that the Member States should promote research programs in order to improve the knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendations and efforts of community and international research. With this motion, we therefore ask the regional government to activate, through a funding to be explicitly predicted for this purpose, a study system and overall impact system on human and environmental health system of the entire infrastructure system, networks and their emissions that will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G networks infrastructures, in order to guarantee and protect the health of the Avalthians."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,4,4159,"Our group shares the need for digitization that is for our country and obviously also for our region. The diffusion of ultralarga band throughout the national territory, both with fiber and with 5G, where an alternative is not possible, can serve to fill a gap, that of the digital divide which is undoubtedly a gap in our territory. But this must happen, in our opinion - or rather, had to take place - without changes to the limits of exposure and precautionary attention to risks or potential health risks which, with the increase, can obviously manifest themselves. Currently the limit was set at 15 volts per meter, by the competition decree in 2023, and previously it was 6 volts per meter, so we are talking about a more than doubled, and it is a limit that generated not a few controversies, because there is no valid reason to raise the attention value for the electromagnetic fields generated by the high frequencies, if not the economic one, of course of the telecommunications managers, who intend to save on costs of their infrastructure. It is a threshold that has been taken without a real scientific foundation and there are strong concerns that have been manifested by many parts, really many; I quote only one, because it is the one that, among the many I have read, seemed even more convincing to me and which is that of Dr. Belpoggi who has long been a scientific director of the Ramazzini Institute of Bologna who, as we know, is an institution that deals with cancer prevention. He is currently scientific manager of ISDE, the Association of Doctors for the Environment. Dr. Belpoggi, in a recent publication, said: ""The power density will change, that is, the energy absorbed by our body, which will increase by six times so much. Today Italy has wanted to align with other European countries, raising its limit, but then because it has not also aligned itself in measurement times? It is true that the limit considered safe is 61 volts per meter, so we are at 15, We should theoretically rest assured, but the fact is that in other European states, which also have limits higher than the Italian one, these values ​​have been measured on the maximum peaks. So what happens? That the data, in some way, are false. From this thing it is clear that our body, or of those who expose themselves to these peaks, has a higher frequency, on this I believe it does not rain. That of electromagnetic waves, at the moment, remains a topic that is still, in our opinion, too little investigated. In -depth analyzes have been made, but we believe they are not - on a general level, I mean - enough, because being exposed 24 hours a day, especially for some categories of people, I think of children, the elderly, the pregnant women, can be dangerous; I use the ""can"" because we do not have very certain data, but it is something that a whole series of scientists tells us, and then why not replace, for example, the large antennas - which have a concentration - with a series of smaller antennas also to dilute this exposure? You could keep the 6 volts that we had until before changing the situation, but to keep them what was needed? A very high expense was needed, which was estimated between 3 and 4 billion per year, a cost that operators do not want to support. So the commitment of this motion is welcome, which basically what does it ask? He asks for an in -depth analysis and monitoring of the impact on health. We believe that it is correct that an activity of this type is activated, also in our region, precisely because this impact of 5G technology is considered controversially by one and by the other, but having an in -depth analysis can still help clarify. We will therefore vote for the motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Baccega,Mauro,1955.0,M,FI,6,1424,"We have read with great attention the motion that was presented by the two opposition groups and that brought us back to the motion that we placed the attention of the junta last May, identifying the will and the need to make a verification and a series of insights in the paths. Even in the municipality of Gignod, we had evaluated two different situations, one that crossed the municipalities from Charvensod to Aymavilles and the other which concerned the antenna that will have to be positioned in the municipality of Gignod; In that motion we really asked for an in -depth analysis, identifying the subject who could give us important information in harp compared to a study that must, in our opinion, be done. The commitment therefore that the motion sets to the attention of the Council, or to make an in -depth analysis of the health of the entire infrastructure system and networks and their emissions, which will be obtained with the addition of the new 5G networks infrastructures, is certainly in line with what is our thoughts. It is certainly a matter of deepening and it is above all of giving a minimum of security also to the populations that somehow are close to these plants and which are sometimes urged by information that can also be misleading. That science gives us concrete answers compared to these paths. We will vote with conviction this motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,8,11501,"I appreciated the interventions of the councilors Manfrin and Minelli, a sign that they have carefully prepared on this complicated theme, and it would be the case that many councilors here in this classroom took care of it at least a little. I also thank Baccega for the intervention. I supported this motion - it could not be otherwise - and doing it I particularly turn to the majority of the Council, which is so sensitive to the themes of health and the ecosystem, so resilient to fight their battle in the name of a clearer and healthier environment; In particular, the family fathers who are responsible for the tomorrow of future generations for tomorrow. I wanted to tell you that electromagnetic fields represent one of the most popular environmental pollutants, rapidly increasing in the environment, and that they are capable of biological modifications on cells and living organisms, including men. The magnetic fields are natural, as we know, control all the vital processes of living beings, therefore molecular movements, cellular oscillations, ionic interactions. The electromagnetic fields are produced by nature, and I speak of cosmic rays, light energy, geomagnetism of the earth and living beings themselves. The fact is that until 1940 the natural cleaning fund was 0,0002 volt/meter, but in the last century there was a huge entry of low and high frequency artificial fields, therefore radio antennas, phones, electric cables, lamps, appliances, electrodes, etc., etc. high frequency, at low frequency, with low frequency but high intensity, the subject is very complex, the topic is very complex. The level of radio frequency radiation since 1940, indeed, let it shorter, from 1985 to 2005, in 20 years, the level of radio frequency radiation in industrialized countries has increased by 5 thousand times, therefore 5 thousand times in several radiation than the human being, like all living beings, receives. Will he do well? The 5G system was born in the last century in the US from a search by the military industry for the guidance of tanks, drones, missiles, 3D images views, it works with broad -frequency waves issuing elements, in the 700 MHz and 27 Ghz bands, but you will soon reach 86 GHz, impressive things, with Phased Array antennas, which are the phase terraced vectors, I am not doing it more difficult, but there is no more difficult one, That we would have to deepen the fixed geometry of the currently existing 3G networks, while the 5G network requires a different geometry. All this to say that we are installing a 5G on the fixed geometry of the 3G, this is naturally underutilized, but these are topics that we hope to deal with the technicians. In all this, the 5G will operate with much higher frequencies than those used so far and will add up to the fields of the current 2G, 3G and 4G, making it difficult to measure the electromagnetic field by the harp. The installation of numerous micro repeaters in urban areas will be necessary: ​​250 squares for square mile is calculated, which corresponds to an antenna every 100 m², remember, there will be an antenna for every 100 m². Today's news: in Milan a thousand lampposts will see the installation of Small Cell, of which colleague Manfrin spoke, installed on the poles of public lighting, will take care of the A2A. What happens? That the small cells on the lampposts will be at the beginning of a process that will lead to the network, naturally more powerful, more widespread to improve the connection, but the residents are already collecting signatures, because this is the first step towards a Smart City model, of course this to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. But what happens elsewhere? In Arezzo on October 8, 2024, so I speak of just over a month ago, the Municipality has made up the The Municipality of Arezzo proceeded to the drafting of an office cancellation measure in self -protection regarding the installation of the new radio base station for cell phone. The act was consequently entrusted to the technical opinion which highlighted the prevalence of the protection of public health on the provision of mobile telephony services, however the area was already covered. ""The antenna must be dismantled"", these are the words of the Municipality, the lack of indifference and urgency have been highlighted, as conditions for the release of the authorization and the unavailability of the company to identify a different solution has forced them precisely to this decision. It is therefore determined to proceed with the office cancellation of the previously granted authorization act and, consequently, to arrange the restoration of the state of the places. The antenna was taken and taken away. Later the example of the mayor of Cassano Ionio, it is good to remember it: he issued an ordinance with which he asked the stop to the works, waiting for all the checks to ensure the protection of the health of the population were carried out. In Tuscany, you will know it well, on September 22, therefore not even two months ago, the regional council resolution, signed by the Councilor for the environment and the councilor for health, I repeat: the councilor for the environment and the councilor for regional health, certainly more attentive to the health of their fellow citizens of other mountain realities that we know well, have allocated a figure of 222 thousand euros to conduct what is perhaps the first scientific research at a public level, at least in Italy. Tuscany has decided on a 5G study, six capital cities of about 100 thousand inhabitants, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Florence and Arezzo, indeed, some more than 100 thousand, will try to understand which link is among the tumors accused by the population, especially childish, and the electromagnetic fields generated by the radio base stations that are rising a little everywhere in Tuscany. So far the scientific community, as the colleagues who preceded me claimed, has only investigated the aspect of electromagnetic fields, that is, the thermal aspect. The aspect on biological tissues is very different. There will be the two regional agencies that are involved. ARPA Toscana is in charge of measuring exposure to supervelceal broadband pollution; Among its duties: analyze the limits and the development scenarios of the 5G network; elaborate a mathematical model that allows the forecast on an urban scale of the exposure levels present in the capitals; measure the exposure with the control units already supplied and buy others; carry out checks on existing 5G systems, possibly of different managers, and on those under construction that are installing; Apply to special broadbands for broadband dosimeters to measure exposure and evaluate the exposure levels where this is higher and where the population density is greater, in particular in the areas where there are schools, with the presence of children. At the Ars, on the other hand, the regional health agency will be up to: the monitoring of health and epidemiological surveillance on the cities where there are a little higher electromagnetic field levels, the estimates can also be perfected within homes and schools; Make an estimate of the possible associations between exposure to electromagnetic fields and diseases. ""On the basis of the scarce scientific literature available"", says Ars, ""it is expected to focus attention on the childish population, as more susceptible to the effects of electromagnetic pollution"". What happens to children? It happens that the CEMs, that is, electromagnetic fields, have no problems crossing the human body, the images obtained from the radiological equipment with magnetic resonance imaging, which show the entrance of the field in the human cranial box to contact, for example, of a mobile phone, demonstrate this. This dynamic is the basis of the pathogenesis of the acoustic nerve tumors and the areas of the brain tissue exposed to the side of contact with the mobile phone. The impressive thing is that in adults, the penetration is a few centimeters, while in a child it almost completely crosses the brain, of course having a more fragile, lighter base. Dr. Gandus, who was in connection a short time ago with Aosta, on the occasion of an evening dedicated to the topic, argued that the increase in childbilled brain tumors is being found in the 2000s and probably one of the causes could be the electromagnetic waves. The studies - have been mentioned by his colleague - are infinite, there are more than 10 thousand studies, and we mention the International Agency for Cancer Research, the study of Prof.hardell, the National Toxicology Program, the Ramazzini Institute has also been mentioned, etc. etc., but we also have the judicial in court: the Tar of Lazio in 2019 and the Monza in March 2019 electromagnetics and cancer beyond any reasonable doubt. What happens here in Valle d'Aosta, on the other hand? Twice, the Councilor for the Environment replied that the data correspond to how much literature and recent studies have documented, but the problem is that there is this institute that carried out these detections, the ICNIRP, International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection, and has established the not worrying level 61 volt/metro, and is the measure adopted at European level. The problem is that this institute is considered an authority only by the European Commission, which has conferred the assignment to this small private association of Bavaria to draw up the guidelines for the limitation on exposure. The assignment was assigned in 1997 and in 1998 these measures have already been issued, that is 61 volt/metro, but the studies - I have spoken of more than 10 thousand studies worldwide - support a very different thing, namely that already at 0.2 volts/metro there is an interaction with the human fabric, so there is certainly a lot to do, there is a lot to be deepened. The drift is that, in addition to this disaster on the mainland, the 5G project will also come from space. There is a launch in an orbit of at least 20 thousand satellites that will cover the earth with adjustable bands from the stratosphere, each will emit 5 million watts on the ground that will connect to the billions of objects of the internet of things, we are talking about cars, televisions, computers and tablets, it is estimated that already in 2020 there were over 20 billion these connected objects, making the environment where we live a real microwave oven 24 hours a day 24 hours a day, Without escape, without the possibility of turning it off or hiding somewhere else. Welcome therefore, we hope in a little, a little - does not demand so much - of common sense by this government, welcome an in -depth analysis: I must admit that the president of the III Commission, which I asked for the possibility of obtaining auditions from the scientific world in this classroom, has been activated and shortly we should agree with these meetings. The request is that the scientific world is listened to and not only the highly respectable Arpa technicians, for whom we have all the necessary respect, but here we have scientists who have dedicated the whole life to these research. We have scientists, we have doctors, who daily compare with this problem. I would really like to understand what the impediment can be to seriously deepen this issue."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Caveri,Luciano Emilio,1958.0,M,UV,10,4011,"This time it's up to me because we talk about pylons, as well as talking about 5G technology. I have heard the well -known theories of those who are against 5G exposed, it is an interesting, anti -modernist movement, which connects to other anti -modernist theories. I remember what he said that those who made the vaccine would have died, now, making the horns, I would not want to die at the end of my intervention, but it is completely evident that there are contradictions that I would like to say immediately. I understand the position of the director Lucianaz, who has always fought, and must also be acknowledged with the technical competence that would envy the degree in the physics of his colleague Lavevaz, but I find that there is a contradiction in the colleagues of the League and in the colleagues of Forza Italia, because it was your governments, and in particular the Meloni government, to increase the electromagnetism rate - he recalled it with the date of 2023 - Collega Minelli. How is your government that has been reminded of a legislative decree that would have given some chances to the municipalities at least to move those pylons that will also be put in the Aosta Valley. I must only correct the councilor Minelli: 5G are small plants, technology is very different. There will be smaller pylons than the large pylons we have today. Then it is difficult today, Director Manfrin, to feel that the Aosta Valley League - I imagine in a logic of federalism, that I appreciate - say of things contrary to what the government says. The government has, in fact, liberalized the positioning of the pylons, today no one can do anything, neither the Region nor the municipal regulatory plans, and we will see how the question of Arezzo will end, because it is in the hands of administrative justice with the latest regulations that on the one hand have increased the limits of the electromagnetic fields in Italy, which remain - I also say this to the councilor Minelli - lower than those of the European average, but above all with the conversion Law Decree, there is this provision: in order to allow the timely achievement of digital transformation objectives for the interventions of the Italia 5G Plan of the realization of new network infrastructures suitable practically nothing can be done. We do not have the municipalities that today say: ""In place to put the trellis there, we put it there"", have no faculty. This was a political clarity. I repeat, who is against 5G, do so legitimately, amazes me that those who today with the law of the state has favored a massive movement of these pylons, today in this classroom the opposite. Then, for heaven's sake, I repeat, I imagine that there is a locality respect and I would not like it to be just a crush the eye to those who are against 5G. Because there is no need to do a specific study, this I do not say this, I obviously deepened with the technicians of the department, but above all with the harp, which is the one that measures must make, which must correspond to those limits that, as I said before, have increased. According to the harp is useless, because she is part of an Italian harp system that continues to have a constant exchange of information with respect to the scientific research that is done and as you know there is also a central body called Ispra, also in connection with all the institutes that are doing the research and that largely deny some things you have said today, because they are still the official results that regulate the national legislation and As autonomy, a possibility of changing technical standards that even have a European value. According to the harp, it is more than enough to be part of this system, they would today be specific studies in the Aosta Valley and money thrown away, because all the institutes of which it is part, with very large collaborations, our harp, are doing it with great effectiveness, so we will abstain."

If in the month of May the answer that came from the junta had been of this tenor, we certainly would have deepened, but we did not have this response from the junta, or there was a following passage to the month of May, or ... in any case we ask here, for the purposes of people's health, if what is happening is a feasible path. She tells me that nothing can be done anymore, we take note of it, but in our opinion an in -depth analysis of the populations that have the superpénix that passes on the roof ... something will have to be seen and do because, in my opinion, there will be some problems. We will do some insights too. I have not spoken and I did not say that Forza Italia is against 5G, this cannot put it in my mouth, I simply said that for the purposes of the health of the population it would be appropriate to do insights, and that's why we want to vote for this motion."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Manfrin,Andrea Fabrizio,1983.0,M,LEGA VDA,14,6464,"Thanks, Councilor Caveri, for his answer that, for once, honestly, I expected different, precisely because I know that she is a person who prepares himself and who deepens the themes; Instead it has fallen objectively into an answer that is more obvious than Mickey's jokes, and I regret this for two reasons for reasons. The first is that you attempted to try to paint the people who raise a request, who is not to return to the stone age, to live like the Mormons, but it is a request - as has been said correctly by the colleagues of Forza Italia, as well as by the other colleagues who preceded me during the illustration of this initiative, during the general discussion - to have protections and to make insights from the point of view of health. I am not known to be one of those who want to plant the daisies on the highway, so you cannot accuse me of being one who hates modernity, certainly hate impositions, she knows that she and I think differently on vaccination obligations for example, I am for freedom, she is to force people by force, under penalty of social and working death, they were very happy with the obligations of choice. The people who made or did not make a certain health treatment and this marks the difference between us who is absolutely legitimate, as she highlighted. However, if she had had a less ideological approach and more on the merits - because she is capable of making this type of analysis, absolutely, certainly much more than the undersigned who has made less politics than her - and she had limited himself to reading the text, he would have seen that there is no conspiracy theory here, no terrapiattism, no hypothesis of canceling any technological network of our region, but a very simple request, that is to make studies and deepen the theme of the potential risks of the network. She raised the political question and I am happy that she did it, I will obviously answer them in two parts. The first is that if she goes to see, despite the increase of which she has spoken, which is absolutely correct, Italy remains one of the European countries with the lower emissions, with the lowest limits, therefore evidently this increase has been made, but keeping in mind that it was necessary to remain in certain standards, obviously remedying criticism, which rightly recalled - and I think that she does not have to explain to her, above all that she had a cohabitation in the junta with political movements, with political movements. He did not share - But sometimes, when you governing, you must also find a square and sometimes you share things that maybe you don't share, I'm not saying that it happened but I'm talking in general. However, I must also tell you another thing, Councilor Caveri, who on the political question, however, forgets a small step, that is, that this same commitment and this same deepening was approved by the Tuscany Region and not with a motion, but with a resolution of the council. The last time I checked, and control every morning, the Tuscany Region also had its regional control agency. At the moment when you tell us that the Arpa checks are sufficient, it tells us that the Tuscany region is a region of crazy crazy - who have a regional agency that does not work, terrapiattisti, probably also go around with tinfoil on the head so as not to be psychologically manipulated ... - or we can accept the fact that perhaps, having a further study and further study, you can only do good, because maybe she does not say what she says, There is no problem, that everything is fine, or maybe not. This brings me back to my memory what happened this morning and what happened last week during the commission: we asked to make an audition with the entrepreneurial categories to have their opinion, but no, it was said not, because we prefer to avoid that there is perhaps the risk that someone can deny what you say or question it, and here I seem to be exactly in the same alveo. You are afraid to deepen because maybe the results are not expected. Now you see, councilor, we have addressed the debate with the maximum opening, I think you can act, I did not make political issues, I did not make issues, Crusades Terrapiattisti, I simply asked a question that is what she sees, there is somewhere raised an evident possibility that this can harm health, because either we imagine that everything always goes well, or, if we want to put, as you have rightly made the first time, Having placed, we can imagine that science often wonders and has doubts - it is the essence of a demonstration - therefore having this technology recently, even the long -term effects of this technology are not known. If actually what she says is true, then the recommendation of the European Council of 12 July 1999 would have meaning, where you ask to promote research programs in order to improve the knowledge of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health, taking into account the recommendation of international community research efforts, it will probably have been an Terrapiattista Europe who does not believe in progress and who wants to reduce everyone to bring the age of the stone or perhaps there are the right concerns. Perhaps, at this point, the Region, which is also governed by the Democratic Party, will actually be a reckless region, and then I advise you to communicate it to colleagues, saying that your colleagues from Tuscany are all crazy and do not understand anything or perhaps maybe ask yourself doubts. Make doubts, having doubts probably also leads to having results that can confirm or deny what we assume, on the one hand and the other. I believe this is a doubt that can come to everyone. She believes she has science infused and saying: ""No, it's not like that"", we are sorry for her, but it is not so for us. We obviously do not collect this motion, clearly we are anxious to see how the vote will be distributed, we have expressed our position and I think it is clear."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Lucianaz,Diego,1963.0,M,RV,16,3362,"This time I do not address me exclusively to the commissioner Caveri with whom we have opened a debate on this topic, but to the whole junta, that is, I must admit that the Union Valdôtaine demoralizes me more and more, a party of which I would sign every line of its statute, but unfortunately here you are behaving absurdly, not only you do not interest the francoproves, and you demonstrate it at any initiative, not only you are not interested in the health of the health of the health of the health of the Valdostani, when we face the hospital's speech, which you rightly considered from your point of view; There is someone who instead sees it in a diametrically opposite way, but, on this point, I just can't understand where your sense of administrators is. You are, in my opinion of course, and I subscribe to what I say, the disappointment of a people, because asking to deepen a theme such as that of electromagnetic waves, on which all the communities ... I mentioned the communities of the Levant Ligurian last time, in which the Ligurian ANCI was activated to ask for insights, and, among other things, the President of the Liguria Region had difficulties on these aspects. We ask you at least to discuss it in the Commission, which, among other things, are secreted, so you cannot even spread the data, not even that ... I mentioned article 191 of the European Treaty, so dear to Councilor Caveri, who pretext the protection of health to economic interests; We all know this, there are large, huge, well -enormous economic interests, we try to protect them, someone is more convinced than others, perhaps no one is against progress. Then if I participate in the manifestations with the no vax I do it willingly, I don't go to see who you attend you, and in any case I don't give a damn. The meaning is that I support the freedom of every Valley citizen to express himself and I also go to listen to him, look a little. The fact that we continue to mention recent studies, assessed, etc. ... I continue to reiterate that the Institute of ICNIRP, the International Commission for Protection from non -ionizing radiation I have told you before, is a private agency, with reduced activity, consisting of an unstorational commission of twelve members, Bavarian, in which there was no doctor - and I have turned to the councilor colleague BARMASSE, That there is no doctor in this hearing. Not even here in this commission there is a doctor, look a little, yet the harp, like all other political governments, relies on this study. Perhaps you do not know, I say this too: in 2020 the Turin Court of Appeal denounced the conflict of interest of the Bavarian icnirp of which I told you before, calling it ""private organization, whose guidelines have a great economic and strategic importance for the telecommunications industry"", with which several icnirp members have links through consultancy relationships. The Turin Court of Appeal always says, sentence of 2020: ""It is clear that these subjects should refrain from evaluating the effect on health, which Icnirp itself has declared safe and not harmful to health"". These are judgments of Italian courts. You smile, as usual continue with this spirit. You are a real disappointment."
47991,XVI,20/11/2024,"INFORMAZIONE, Radiotelecomunicazioni",en,Minelli,Chiara,1966.0,F,PCP,18,3819,"By declaration of vote and to confirm what I had said previously, that is, that we will support this motion, but also to make a consideration more than anything else on the response given by the commissioner Caveri, that is, the heart of the motion, i.e. the need or not to do a specific study. The commissioner says: ""There is no need for a specific study to be done, I don't say it, Arpa says it, it is completely useless because Arpa is within a national system which is also part of Ispra and therefore there are already studies that speak, which document a series of things"". I believe that we all know that Arpa is inside the Snpa system, that is, of the federative system that includes twenty -one agencies for the environment, because there are the two autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano, and which also rightly includes Ispra, but what does this system do? It is a system that collects the studies that the individual agencies make, and then obviously also elaborates lines, gives indications to the other agencies, but I do not understand why our harp could not, in our territory, to do a study with the characteristics that we have highlighted and then obviously sharing it, within the system, reasoning with others, because normally this is what they do, with the supervision of ISPRA, with the relationships that are among the various agencies. To me the motivation leaves a little perplexed, which we cannot change things is fine, it can be absolutely accepted, but contribute to a scientific deepening on a territory that is limited (which perhaps could also be lent to make assessments to share and perhaps to be validated or not validate through the other agencies that on their own territory can do the same action) to me it would seem a fairly sensible thing. Honestly, it is something that left me a little perplexed as a motivation. I would also like to make a clarification, but I believe that the commissioner, when he spoke, did not refer so much to us, then it seems to me that he also explicitly explicit it about the question that there are people who are contrary to 5G. I specified, intervening, that from our point of view this is a technology that must not be demonized, that both the fiber and the 5G can be useful to fill the gap that is there, that is, the fact that our country is poorly still digitized, but this must not be done at the expense of what could be the protection of citizens' health. I do not pretend to say that it is absolutely negative, I have reported opinions that are opinions of scientists, and I think they also have a respectable curriculum, but then, precisely to get to a definition and closure of the circle, all studies that can be done, in my opinion, are useful and can also be used for a wider debate that obviously does not only involve our region. It is obvious that we are within a country system that is very complex, certainly instead I share what the councilor on the fact that, at the level of government decisions, that of moving the limits from 6 volt/metro to 15 is a decision that has been taken at the central level, so it is obvious that this were made on this. Then everyone can have concerns, which are absolutely legitimate, and wanting to deepen, it seems to me that it has been explained, this does not mean that our country was in a situation, compared to other European countries - certainly from my point of view - better, because those 6 volts per meter were, from the point of view of health protection, better than 15, so it was not, it was decided differently and on this there are obviously responsibilities."
